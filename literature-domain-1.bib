====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Procedural experimentalism represents a distinctive approach to normative justification
in political philosophy. Unlike traditional outcome-based or procedural justifications,
this framework—developed primarily by Adams and Himmelreich—argues that certain
decision-making procedures involving experimentation can themselves justify mid-level
normative principles through moral learning. The core insight is that experimentation
within institutional contexts can reveal which principles are action-guiding and stable
under reflective scrutiny. This domain includes foundational work on experimental
approaches to political philosophy, pragmatist theories of democratic experimentation
(Dewey, Anderson), and recent work applying experimental methods to normative theory.
Key debates center on whether procedural experiments can generate normative authority,
how they differ from empirical experiments in science, and what role moral learning
plays in legitimating institutions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the core philosophical framework for the research project.
Adams and Himmelreich's procedural experimentalism is designed for human institutions
making collective decisions. The project's central innovation is extending this
framework to agentic markets—where AI agents make decisions on behalf of humans.
Understanding the original framework's justificatory structure, its conditions for
success, and its limitations is essential for determining whether and how it can
be extended to non-human decision-makers in market contexts.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
Last decade has seen increased interest in experimental approaches to normative
political theory, moving beyond traditional experimental philosophy (which tests
folk intuitions) to frameworks that use experimentation as a source of normative
authority itself. Adams and Himmelreich's work represents the most developed
philosophical account of procedural experimentalism specifically.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work extends procedural experimentalism beyond human institutional contexts.
No existing literature applies this framework to AI-mediated decision-making or
agentic markets. The moral learning mechanisms central to procedural experimentalism
assume human reflective capacities; how these mechanisms function when agents are
non-human but represent human interests remains unexplored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on Adams & Himmelreich as the core framework, but contextualize within broader
experimental and pragmatist traditions. The gap between their human-institution focus
and the project's agentic-market application should be central to the review.

  title = {Procedural Experimentalism: A Framework for Evaluating AI Ethics Tools},

  number = {2},
  pages = {15},
  doi = {10.1007/s10676-023-09689-w},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Applies procedural experimentalism specifically to AI ethics contexts, arguing that tools for ethical AI development should be evaluated based on whether they enable productive experimentation and moral learning rather than on whether they guarantee correct outcomes. The procedural experimental approach treats ethical guidelines as hypotheses to be tested through implementation. RELEVANCE: Directly relevant as it extends procedural experimentalism to AI contexts, though focuses on AI development tools rather than AI agents in markets. Shows that procedural experimentalism has been applied beyond purely human institutional contexts, providing precedent for our extension to agentic markets.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops pragmatist account of democratic experimentalism where publics form around shared problems and experiment with different institutional solutions. Knowledge about what democratic procedures should look like emerges from experimentation rather than a priori theorizing. Democratic institutions should be understood as experimental and revisable based on their consequences. RELEVANCE: Foundational work in democratic experimentalism that influences contemporary procedural experimentalism. Provides philosophical backdrop for understanding how experimentation can generate normative authority. The focus on problems-first and experimental adjustment is relevant to our framework for evaluating agentic markets. POSITION: Pragmatist democratic experimentalism.},

This creates accountability through comparison rather than hierarchical control. Emphasizes provisional goal-setting and iterative revision. RELEVANCE: Provides concrete institutional model of how experimental procedures can work in governance contexts. The emphasis on comparison, monitoring, and iterative revision is relevant for designing agentic market experiments. Shows how experimentalism scales beyond small democratic settings.

In imperfect procedural justice, there is an independent criterion of right outcome but no procedure guaranteed to achieve it.

Procedures must meet threshold of epistemic value while remaining acceptable to all qualified points of view. Rejects both pure proceduralism and pure outcome-based views. RELEVANCE: Important for understanding epistemic dimensions of procedural justification that procedural experimentalism builds on. Relevant for evaluating agentic markets: procedures must both be acceptable and have some capacity to track good outcomes. The threshold concept is useful for AI contexts.

Central coordination by experts can outperform decentralized experimentation in many contexts. Questions whether experimental approaches really enable learning.

Group agents are distinct from individual members. Analyzes conditions under which groups exhibit rationality and responsibility.

Citizens engage in deliberative specification of vague normative commitments through public reasoning. This process has epistemic value in discovering what our values require. Institutional design should enable specification processes. RELEVANCE: Provides model of how procedural deliberation can be epistemically valuable in discovering normative requirements.
