## Introduction

Housing crises across liberal democracies reveal fundamental tensions in how contractualist theories handle property, place, and coercion. Despite decades of development in contractualist moral and political philosophy—from Rawls's (1971) theory of justice as fairness to Scanlon's (1998) account of reasonable rejection—these frameworks have seen surprisingly limited application to housing and land use policy. Yet housing involves direct state coercion (eminent domain, zoning, displacement) requiring justification to all affected parties—precisely the domain where contractualist reasonable rejection should apply. As Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe in their comprehensive survey of housing justice philosophy, normative frameworks beyond human flourishing and relational equality remain underdeveloped, and philosophical engagement with housing policy's macroeconomic dimensions is particularly sparse. This gap is striking given that housing policy fundamentally concerns the fair terms of social cooperation, a central contractualist concern.

This review synthesizes philosophical and empirical literature to establish that standard contractualist approaches face four systematic problems when applied to housing. First, contractualist frameworks implicitly presume that primary goods are fungible—commensurable via a single metric—yet housing generates non-fungible, location-specific value through mechanisms that resist such measurement. Rawls's (1971) primary goods framework treats goods as "all-purpose means" valuable across conceptions of the good, enabling index-based comparisons. But as urban economics demonstrates, location creates irreducible productive value through agglomeration externalities that cannot be exported, compensated, or replicated elsewhere. When housing's value is constituted by context rather than merely affected by it, standard contractualist metrics fail.

Second, housing justice involves a structural conflict between incumbent occupancy rights and excluded outsiders' access claims—a contractualist deadlock where protecting one party's legitimate claims necessarily violates another's. Recent philosophical work on occupancy rights (Stilz 2019; Huber and Wolkenstein 2018) grounds territorial claims in individuals' located life plans, extending protection against displacement and neighborhood transformation. Yet this literature systematically neglects how such protection can be justified to those excluded from opportunity-rich locations who equally need access to pursue their own life plans. This occupancy-versus-access stand-off represents a paradigmatic contractualist problem: competing legitimate claims that cannot both be fully satisfied require principles justifiable to all affected parties, yet current frameworks lack resources for resolving or even adequately framing such conflicts.

Third, housing's dual role as both necessity and wealth-accumulation asset creates what housing systems scholars call "the really big contradiction" (Fikse and Aalbers 2020): financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations because price appreciation that enables wealth accumulation systematically destroys affordability for newcomers. This dual-role problem generates a contractualist impasse where neither appreciation nor price suppression can satisfy reasonable acceptance criteria for both incumbent owners and excluded non-owners. Property-owning democracy approaches, despite their contractualist pedigree (Freeman 2018), face acute justifiability problems when applied to housing because dispersed homeownership creates wealth inequality through appreciation, yet suppressing appreciation undermines the asset-based security such approaches aim to provide.

Fourth, urban planning decisions create irreversible path dependencies that bind future generations whose preferences remain epistemically uncertain. Standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize epistemic duties under conditions of irreversibility and uncertainty about future values. While intergenerational justice literature addresses preference uncertainty, it rarely integrates epistemic justice frameworks that could ground obligations to preserve future interpretive capacities. Planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future options may commit distinctive epistemic harms—constraining future generations' capacities to interpret and pursue their own conceptions of the good—that contractualism currently lacks resources to address.

These four failings are systematic, not merely gaps in application. They reveal that housing requires distinctive contractualist treatment beyond general distributive principles. This review demonstrates this claim by synthesizing literatures that have largely developed independently: contractualist foundations (Rawls 1971, 1993; Scanlon 1998; Freeman 2018); urban economics on agglomeration and spatial misallocation; housing systems research on financialization; philosophical work on occupancy rights and gentrification; capabilities and human rights approaches to housing justice (Wells 2019; Kimhur 2024; Shue 2020); epistemic justice theory (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013); and intergenerational obligations under uncertainty. Halliday and Meyer (2024) identify precisely this need: integration of normative analysis with empirical housing dynamics and development of frameworks beyond existing approaches.

The review proceeds as follows. Section 1 establishes the fungibility assumption's failure by examining how location generates non-exportable value through agglomeration mechanisms and civic participation requirements. Section 2 maps the occupancy-versus-access deadlock and housing's dual-role problem, showing how these create contractualist impasses where no principles can simultaneously satisfy all affected parties. Section 3 develops epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority under conditions of irreversibility and preference uncertainty. Section 4 positions contractualism against competing frameworks—human rights, capabilities, and relational equality approaches—clarifying contractualism's distinctive contribution and challenges. The synthesis concludes by identifying specific research gaps where contractualist resources require development: integration of non-fungible goods into justificatory frameworks, resolution of structural conflicts between legitimate competing claims, navigation of housing's dual-role contradiction, and grounding of epistemic duties that do not presume reciprocity or social relations with future generations.

This review contributes not a comprehensive solution to housing justice but rather clearer analysis of where contractualist justification reaches its limits and what normative resources are needed to address housing's distinctive features. The goal is to position future research that develops contractualist frameworks adequate to housing's complexity—frameworks that can handle non-fungible location-specific value, adjudicate between competing legitimate claims, address structural contradictions in housing systems, and ground epistemic obligations under planning irreversibility. Only by recognizing these systematic problems can contractualist theory develop the resources housing justice requires.


## Section 1: The Fungibility Assumption and Location-Specific Value

Dominant contractualist frameworks for distributive justice—both Rawlsian and Dworkinian—implicitly assume that goods can be rendered commensurable through standardized metrics, enabling interpersonal comparisons and trade-offs essential for contractualist justification. Yet housing in particular locations resists this fungibility assumption. Empirical evidence from urban economics demonstrates that location generates irreducible productive value through agglomeration mechanisms that cannot be exported or replicated elsewhere, while philosophical theories of positional and contextual goods provide conceptual resources for understanding goods whose value depends essentially on relational or spatial features. This section establishes that location-specific value challenges the fungibility assumption at the heart of contractualist frameworks, creating the first systematic failing when standard approaches confront housing justice.

### Primary Goods and the Fungibility Assumption

Rawls's theory of justice as fairness treats primary goods—"things that every rational man is presumed to want" including "rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth"—as an index enabling interpersonal comparisons while respecting reasonable pluralism about the good life (Rawls 1971, p. 62). The primary goods metric abstracts from particular attachments and conceptions of value, providing "all-purpose means" useful for pursuing diverse life plans (Rawls 2001). This abstraction enables the original position thought experiment: behind the veil of ignorance, rational agents select principles of justice without knowledge of their particular circumstances, attachments, or values. The framework assumes that what matters for justice can be captured through a weighted index of fungible goods, where inequalities in one dimension (income) might be justified by advantages in another (opportunities) via the difference principle.

Dworkin's equality of resources makes fungibility even more explicit. His hypothetical auction mechanism requires that all resources be tradeable and substitutable, with justice achieved when no one prefers another's bundle to their own (the envy test). Resources are distributed equally when they pass this market-based commensurability test, treating goods as inherently comparable through exchange (Dworkin 1981). The framework depends fundamentally on fungibility: if some goods resist substitution because their value is constituted by features that cannot be replicated or compensated, the auction mechanism and envy test break down.

Anderson's (1999) critique of "luck egalitarianism" challenges this resourcist focus on distributing "neutral resources" that can be metrically equalized. She argues that justice concerns not metric equivalence but whether citizens can function as equals in democratic society—a relational rather than distributive standard. Democratic equality requires capabilities for equal standing, which depend on social and environmental context in ways that resist reduction to fungible resource holdings. Anderson's emphasis on functionings and social relations suggests that goods enabling equal democratic participation may not be substitutable with generic income or wealth transfers, particularly when value depends on relational or spatial features.

The capabilities approach more generally highlights conversion factors—personal, social, and environmental conditions determining whether resources translate into valuable functionings (Sen 1985). Location emerges as a critical environmental conversion factor: the same housing unit provides radically different capabilities depending on access to employment, education, social networks, and political institutions. Yet Sen's framework treats location as affecting conversion of resources into capabilities, potentially preserving a form of fungibility at the capability level. Nussbaum's (2011) more specified approach resists single-metric commensurability by identifying distinct central capabilities requiring threshold protection, but the question remains whether her framework successfully escapes fungibility assumptions or merely shifts them from resources to capabilities.

These frameworks share a common structure: they require some metric—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—for making interpersonal comparisons and evaluating distributive arrangements. The critical question is whether housing in particular locations fits these metrics or resists them. If location-specific value is irreducible to fungible measures, contractualist frameworks premised on commensurable goods face fundamental difficulties in handling housing justice.

### Location-Specific Value and Agglomeration

Urban economics provides compelling empirical evidence that location generates non-exportable value through agglomeration externalities—productivity gains arising from geographic concentration of economic activity. Duranton and Puga's (2004) comprehensive analysis identifies three micro-foundations for agglomeration economies: *sharing* mechanisms (reducing costs through pooled infrastructure, specialized suppliers, and risk-pooling in thick markets); *matching* mechanisms (improving match quality between workers and firms in dense labor markets); and *learning* mechanisms (facilitating knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face interaction). These mechanisms operate at the level of individual interactions to generate city-level productivity advantages that are genuinely location-specific—they depend on the thick markets, specialized infrastructure, and knowledge networks present only in high-density, economically concentrated areas.

The magnitude of these effects is substantial. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) demonstrate that housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities like New York and San Francisco create spatial misallocation of labor, preventing workers from moving to locations where their productivity would be highest. Their spatial equilibrium model estimates that these constraints lowered aggregate US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009—a staggering cost arising from the inability to access location-specific productivity gains. The mechanism operates through housing prices that effectively ration access: when supply is constrained, rising prices deter migration even when wage differentials signal productivity advantages, resulting in systematic underutilization of productive locations.

Ganong and Shoag (2017) document the distributional consequences of this spatial misallocation. Before 1980, low-skill workers migrated to high-income places and experienced income gains, driving regional income convergence across US states. After 1980, disproportionate housing price increases in high-income areas made such migration unprofitable for low-skill workers, who redirected to lower-income locations. This ended historic regional convergence, with housing costs creating spatial segregation by skill level—concentrating low-skill workers in low-productivity areas not by choice but by exclusion through unaffordable housing. The divergence in skill-specific returns to location demonstrates that agglomeration value is not uniformly distributed: workers who would benefit most from access to productive locations face the highest barriers.

De Groot, Poot, and Smit's (2016) meta-analysis synthesizes hundreds of empirical studies, confirming robust positive productivity effects from urban density with knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as the most important mechanisms. Critically, urbanization economies (city-size effects) dominate localization economies (industry-specific clustering), suggesting that broad access to large cities matters for productivity, not merely access to specialized industry clusters. This has implications for fungibility arguments: the productivity gains from agglomeration are not industry-specific amenities that might be substitutable across locations, but general urban advantages tied to city scale and density.

These agglomeration mechanisms generate value that is genuinely non-exportable. Knowledge spillovers operate through face-to-face interaction and social networks that cannot be replicated remotely (Eriksson and Lengyel 2018). Labor market matching benefits depend on market thickness—the number and diversity of potential employers and workers—which varies dramatically across locations (Duranton and Puga 2004). Shared infrastructure and specialized suppliers exist only where demand justifies their presence, making these benefits available exclusively in concentrated locations. The productivity gains from agglomeration are not characteristics that can be packed up and moved or compensated through income transfers—they are constituted by the spatial concentration itself.

This creates a fundamental challenge for fungibility assumptions in contractualist frameworks. If location generates non-exportable productivity gains of the magnitude Hsieh and Moretti document—sufficient to reduce GDP growth by more than a third—then housing in productive locations cannot be treated as fungible with housing elsewhere plus compensating income differentials. The value is location-specific in a constitutive sense: it exists only in particular places and cannot be replicated or fully compensated. Workers excluded from high-productivity locations through housing constraints do not merely face higher costs or inconvenience—they are systematically denied access to productivity-enhancing networks, knowledge spillovers, and matching opportunities that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

### Positional Goods and Contextual Value

Philosophical theories of positional and contextual goods provide conceptual frameworks for understanding goods whose value depends essentially on relational or spatial features, challenging the monistic assumption that all goods can be distributed according to universal principles. Brighouse and Swift (2006) establish that positional goods—goods whose value depends on one's relative standing—generate convergence among typically competing distributive principles. When goods have positional aspects, egalitarians, prioritarians, and sufficientarians converge on favoring more equal distributions than they would for non-positional goods, because relative deprivation matters for well-being independent of absolute levels. The authors distinguish goods that are positional in their nature (like status), in their value (like educational credentials), or in their effects, providing analytical tools for characterizing how relational features affect distributive requirements.

Cass (2023) refines this convergence thesis, showing it succeeds particularly for civic status—the central concern of relational or "social" egalitarianism. Relational equality requires equal civic status, which is inherently positional: one's standing as a citizen partly depends on how one ranks relative to others in access to political participation, public institutions, and community membership. Even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality must therefore favor relatively equal distributions of goods affecting civic status, because extreme inequality in these dimensions creates hierarchical social relations incompatible with equal standing. Housing location plausibly affects civic status in precisely this way: residential segregation by income creates differential access to political institutions, public goods, and community participation that constitutes civic status inequality beyond mere resource differences.

In her subsequent work, Cass (2024) argues that relational equality has distinctive temporal dimensions—civic status unfolds over time, with cumulative segregation across generations compounding status hierarchies. This temporal aspect matters for housing because residential patterns exhibit strong path-dependence: where one's family has lived affects network access, educational opportunities, and community integration in ways that compound across generations. If housing location affects civic status temporally as well as positionally, then policies treating housing as fungible (exchangeable for money compensation upon displacement) fail to respect how location-constituted civic status develops over time and resists substitution.

Freiman (2014) exposes tensions between prioritarian frameworks (focusing on benefiting the worse-off) and positional goods. Prioritarianism evaluates distributions based on absolute welfare levels, yet positional goods' value depends on relative standing. When goods are positional, increasing everyone's absolute level may not improve anyone's situation if relative positions remain unchanged, yet prioritarianism would count this as improvement. Conversely, equalizing positional goods through leveling down might improve relative standing despite reducing absolute welfare. This suggests that location-specific goods with positional aspects may require explicitly relational or egalitarian principles rather than absolute welfare-focused approaches—a conclusion that challenges the difference principle's focus on maximizing the absolute position of the least advantaged.

Pluralist approaches to distributive justice provide theoretical space for goods that resist universal commensuration. Walzer's (1983) spheres of justice argues that different goods belong to distinct spheres with internal distributive logics: membership, security, welfare, money, education, and political power should each be distributed according to principles appropriate to their social meanings, not a single universal metric. Injustice occurs through "tyranny"—when success in one sphere (wealth) illegitimately converts to dominance in another (political power or spatial access). If housing and location constitute a distinct sphere with social meaning tied to community membership, access to opportunities, and political participation, then their distribution should follow principles appropriate to that sphere rather than pure market allocation or generalized resource equality. Walzer's anti-conversion principle particularly resonates: wealth should not automatically convert to exclusive spatial access when location provides goods (civic participation, community membership) that belong to non-market spheres.

Miller's (1999) contextual pluralism offers a more critical version, grounding different distributive principles not in existing social meanings (which might reflect unjust conventions) but in the nature of relationships. Solidaristic communities distribute by need, instrumental associations by desert, and citizenship by equality. Housing in particular locations potentially spans these contexts: it constitutes membership in local communities (solidaristic), provides access to employment (instrumental), and enables political participation (citizenship). This multiplicity suggests that different principles might apply simultaneously, with housing distribution governed partly by need (shelter), partly by contribution (housing as reward), and partly by equality (civic access)—a complexity that resists reduction to fungible resource metrics.

Kymlicka's (1989, 1995) liberal multiculturalist framework establishes precedent within Rawlsian frameworks for goods that are context-dependent and not straightforwardly fungible. He argues that cultural membership should be recognized as a primary good—something rational persons want regardless of their conception of the good—because cultural structure provides the context of choice within which individuals form and pursue life plans. Without access to a rich cultural structure, individual autonomy is severely compromised, yet cultural membership cannot be compensated through generic resources because it provides irreplaceable context for identity and meaningful choice. This parallels the argument for location-specific value: particular locations provide irreplaceable context through community networks, employment opportunities, public institutions, and social capital that cannot be replicated elsewhere or compensated through fungible resources. If Rawlsian frameworks can accommodate cultural membership as a special good, they potentially have conceptual resources to accommodate location-specific goods without abandoning contractualism entirely.

However, the capabilities approach may preserve fungibility assumptions despite emphasizing context-dependence. Sen (1985) treats location as an environmental conversion factor affecting how resources translate into capabilities, but this framework still assumes capabilities themselves provide a common metric for comparison. Nussbaum's (2011) rejection of single-metric commensurability across capabilities moves further from fungibility, but even here the question remains whether location-constituted capabilities are genuinely incommensurable or merely weighted differently in threshold requirements. The distinction matters: if location affects conversion factors, then adequate compensation through additional resources might suffice; if location constitutes capabilities themselves in non-replicable ways, then no compensation can substitute for access.

The philosophical literature on positional and contextual goods thus provides conceptual tools for analyzing location-specific value but has not systematically applied them to housing. Positional goods theory explains why location value might resist fungibility when it depends on relative access or status. Contextual pluralism recognizes that goods tied to particular forms of association (community, citizenship) may require distinct distributive principles. Cultural membership precedents show liberal frameworks can accommodate non-fungible goods. Yet these resources remain under-developed in housing contexts: few philosophers have explicitly challenged fungibility assumptions in Rawls or Dworkin regarding housing, and none have systematically connected positional goods theory, agglomeration economics, and contractualist frameworks to analyze housing justice.

### The First Failing

Location generates non-fungible value through agglomeration mechanisms—knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, shared infrastructure—that create productivity gains available only in particular places and non-replicable elsewhere. The empirical magnitude is substantial: housing constraints preventing access to high-productivity locations reduced US GDP growth by 36 percent over four decades and ended regional income convergence by redirecting low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich areas. These are not merely preferences for particular amenities that might be traded off against other goods; they are constitutive features of locations that determine productivity, opportunity access, and civic participation in ways that resist compensation through fungible resources.

Standard contractualist frameworks implicitly assume goods are fungible—commensurable via primary goods indices, resource bundles passing envy tests, or capability metrics. This assumption enables the interpersonal comparisons and trade-offs essential for contractualist justification: principles can be chosen behind the veil of ignorance because goods are treated as all-purpose means rather than context-specific values, and inequalities in one dimension can be justified by advantages in another. Yet if location-specific value is constitutive rather than convertible, these frameworks lack adequate tools. Housing in productive locations cannot be indexed alongside income and wealth as fungible primary goods if its value depends irreducibly on non-exportable agglomeration externalities. Displacement compensation through monetary transfers cannot satisfy envy tests if location-constituted networks and opportunities are non-replicable. Capability approaches may recognize location as a conversion factor but inadequately capture how location constitutes rather than merely converts value.

Positional goods theory and contextual pluralism provide conceptual resources for non-fungible goods within liberal frameworks, demonstrating that contractualism need not collapse when confronting goods that resist universal metrics. Kymlicka's cultural membership precedent shows primary goods frameworks can be expanded beyond fungible resources to accommodate context-providing goods essential for autonomy. Relational equality approaches recognize that civic status depends on positional features resistant to simple resource redistribution. Yet these philosophical resources remain disconnected from housing justice debates and under-integrated with empirical evidence on agglomeration externalities.

The first failing is thus structural: contractualist frameworks premised on commensurable goods—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—cannot adequately handle housing when location constitutes value in ways that resist fungibility. This is not merely an application gap but a conceptual mismatch between frameworks assuming all-purpose means and goods whose value is irreducibly location-specific. The challenge facing contractualism is whether it can develop principles for distributing non-fungible goods without abandoning the justificatory structure that gives contractualism its distinctive force: principles that can be reasonably accepted by all affected parties must now account for goods that cannot be straightforwardly compared, traded off, or compensated across locations.

## Section 2: Competing Claims and Structural Tensions

Housing justice debates reveal two fundamental structural tensions that create contractualist impasses: the conflict between incumbent occupancy rights and excluded outsiders' access claims, and housing's contradictory dual role as both affordable necessity and wealth-accumulation asset. These tensions resist resolution through standard contractualist principles because protecting any party's legitimate claims necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of others. The literature documents each tension in detail but rarely frames them as problems of contractualist justification.

### The Occupancy vs. Access Stand-Off

The "occupancy turn" in political philosophy, initiated by Stilz's (2019) reconceptualization of territorial sovereignty, grounds territorial rights in individuals' pre-political interests in remaining where their "located life plans" are anchored rather than collective self-determination alone. This framework powerfully explains incumbent residents' moral claims to place-stability: displacement threatens core autonomy interests by disrupting the spatial arrangements on which people's projects, relationships, and identities depend. Huber and Wolkenstein (2018) extend this logic to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have moral rights not merely against direct displacement but against neighborhood transformation that undermines the "background conditions" enabling their life plans. Their account emphasizes that occupancy rights include participatory governance over neighborhood change, not simply individual residence security.

Recent work has enriched understanding of what makes displacement wrongful beyond property loss. Lloyd (2023) argues that gentrification harms residents through damage to "thriving local communities" even without direct displacement, as neighborhood transformation disrupts social networks, local institutions, and shared practices that constitute community goods. Van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey identifies five philosophical approaches to gentrification ethics—autonomy-based, community-based, equality-based, domination-based, and rights-based—noting field consensus around protecting "place-based" or "located life-plans" as the core concern. Dawkins (2023) emphasizes that for disadvantaged populations, local communities function as crucial support networks, making displacement particularly harmful. Draper (2022) extends occupancy theory to democratic participation, arguing gentrification threatens "everyday democracy" through which residents exercise collective agency over shared spaces.

Critical voices challenge pure occupancy approaches while generally accepting their basic framework. Jenkins (2022) argues that occupancy rights theory focuses too narrowly on located life plans, potentially excluding residents whose connection to place is less plan-structured. His republican framing emphasizes gentrification as domination—arbitrary interference in residents' lives by landlords, developers, and newcomers who can unilaterally transform neighborhoods. Wells (2021) emphasizes expressive dimensions: state-led gentrification sends a message that incumbent residents are less valuable than incoming wealthier populations, threatening self-respect and equal standing beyond material harms. Hoover (2023) situates gentrification within broader patterns of structural injustice, emphasizing how displacement compounds existing injustices faced by marginalized communities through histories of racial segregation and disinvestment.

The literature provides sophisticated resources for understanding incumbent claims but exhibits a systematic blind spot: it focuses overwhelmingly on protection of existing residents with minimal attention to excluded outsiders' access claims. Mancilla (2020) offers rare explicit critique, arguing that Stilz's framework privileges settled, place-attached populations over mobile peoples whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. By protecting only "located" occupancy, the framework allows states to exclude mobile populations, undermining the autonomy rationale occupancy theory claims to serve. Van Leeuwen (2024) confirms this pattern, noting the literature converges on protecting incumbents but systematically neglects newcomer claims or the tension between stability and access.

This creates a contractualist impasse. Occupancy theory establishes that incumbent residents have weighty claims grounded in their located autonomy interests. Yet excluded outsiders also need access to place to pursue their life plans—agglomeration economics demonstrates that location generates irreducible productive value through mechanisms like knowledge spillovers and labor market matching that cannot be replicated elsewhere (a point developed in Section 1). How can principles protecting occupancy be justified to excluded populations who also need access to opportunities concentrated in specific locations? Conversely, how can principles prioritizing access be justified to vulnerable incumbents facing displacement whose autonomy depends on place-stability?

The literature provides no satisfactory answer. Some theorists recognize both sets of claims: Bonotti and Barnhill (2022) note that newcomers develop occupancy interests once settled, complicating simple incumbent-newcomer distinctions, and propose scaling protections by disadvantage level. Kim and Walton (2022) argue advantaged groups relocating to disadvantaged neighborhoods can be permissible if properly regulated to prevent displacement. Yet these approaches remain tentative, neither fully addressing the fundamental tension nor demonstrating how any principle could satisfy contractualist requirements of justifiability to all affected parties. The occupancy literature thus identifies one horn of the dilemma—incumbent protection—while leaving the other horn—access claims—largely untheorized.

### Housing Financialization and the Dual-Role Problem

Housing's transformation into a financialized asset creates a distinct structural contradiction that intensifies contractualist tensions. Fikse and Aalbers (2020) identify what they call the "really big contradiction": financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations because housing's function as wealth store systematically destroys its affordability as necessity. The more housing appreciates to serve as financial asset, the less it can function as affordable social good. This contradiction appears across multiple dimensions of housing policy discourse—affordable homeownership rhetoric coexists with declining affordability reality; conservative finance ideology masks risky lending; asset-based welfare promises clash with unequal wealth distribution; tenure neutrality claims obscure systematic advantages for ownership (Fikse and Aalbers 2020).

The housing-finance feedback cycle emerged from specific policy choices in the 1980s. Ryan-Collins (2019) demonstrates how pro-homeownership policy combined with credit liberalization created a self-reinforcing dynamic: land became the most attractive collateral for banks and the most desirable asset for households, where credit expansion drives house prices, which justifies further lending. This cycle, initially concentrated in Anglo-Saxon economies, has spread globally. The structural necessity for price appreciation to validate lending and household wealth strategies makes affordability increasingly incompatible with the system's operation. Ryan-Collins (2021) traces the historical specificity of this arrangement, showing that private landed property's relationship with finance has varied across contexts—current dynamics are not inevitable but result from particular institutional configurations combining strong homeownership preference with financial liberalization.

Empirical evidence documents the contradiction's consequences for inequality. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics, not income inequality or homeownership rates. The political-institutional determinants of income inequality have no effect on wealth-to-income ratios; instead, rising wealth inequality stems from asset price inflation, particularly housing. This finding reveals that the problem is not ownership per se but price dynamics: housing's function as wealth store depends on appreciation, which directly undermines affordability. The intergenerational dimension is stark—Arundel (2017) shows housing equity is highly concentrated with significant inter- and intra-generational divergences in Britain, with younger cohorts facing especially disadvantaged prospects as housing wealth accumulates among older owner households and secondary property investors.

Dewilde and De Decker (2015) provide systematic comparative evidence that housing financialization increases inequality in housing outcomes, specifically harming low-income households' relative position. Increased financialization correlates with deteriorating affordability for low-income owners and private renters compared to middle-income counterparts, controlling for income trends. Crucially, this trend predates the 2008 financial crisis, appearing already in 1995-2007 data, suggesting structural rather than cyclical dynamics. The finding challenges crisis-centric explanations and indicates that financialization itself—not merely crisis episodes—generates systematic inequality.

Comparative housing systems research reveals how institutional design shapes whether the dual-role tension is tractable. Kemeny's (1981) foundational distinction between dualist and unitary housing systems remains influential: dualist systems residualize social rental so it competes with homeownership, making ownership the primary path to housing security; unitary systems maintain robust non-profit and private rental sectors competing with each other, with homeownership less dominant. Kemeny argued homeownership ideology serves class interests by privatizing housing security while reducing pressure for comprehensive welfare provision—the "really big trade-off" between homeownership and welfare. Recent work confirms this typology's relevance: Kohl and Sørvoll (2021) explain divergence between Nordic countries (moving toward high homeownership, mortgage debt, and price increases) and German-speaking countries (maintaining lower homeownership, stronger tenancy, lower indebtedness, stable prices) through differential social-democratic ideologies and cooperative traditions dating to the 1920s.

Christophers (2019) provides crucial normative framing by arguing tenure inequality—ideological and economic inequality between ownership and rental—is the root cause of asset-based inequality. When ownership is systematically privileged over rental through subsidies, ideology, and policy, housing's asset function necessarily creates inequality because only owners access wealth accumulation while renters face affordability pressures without wealth benefits. He argues reinstating tenure equality principles should be the primary policy objective to reduce property asset inequalities and prevent intergenerational reproduction. This analysis suggests the dual-role problem may be policy-constructed rather than inevitable: different institutional arrangements could prevent housing's transformation into wealth accumulation vehicle.

Yet even strong welfare states struggle to prevent this transformation. Benites-Gambirazio and Bonneval (2022) show France—despite its robust social welfare tradition—developed a distinct Housing Asset-Based Welfare regime through pro-homeownership policies since the 1970s combined with welfare retrenchment and pension reforms from the 1990s. France exemplifies how asset-based welfare can emerge across welfare regime types, not merely in Anglo-Saxon contexts. This complicates reform possibilities: if financialization occurs even where strong social protections exist, institutional alternatives may be more constrained than tenure equality advocates suggest.

The dual-role contradiction creates a contractualist impasse structurally parallel to the occupancy/access deadlock. Housing appreciation cannot be justified to excluded newcomers for whom rising prices mean unaffordable access to opportunity. Yet price suppression cannot be justified to incumbent owner-occupiers whose housing is their primary asset and source of economic security. Policies enabling one group's legitimate claims necessarily violate the other group's equally legitimate claims. The contradiction is structural: under financialized conditions where housing serves as the primary wealth store for most households, any housing price policy fails contractualist reasonable acceptance requirements.

### Property-Owning Democracy and Housing's Dual Role

Property-owning democracy offers a potential resolution to wealth concentration problems, yet its application to housing reveals fundamental tensions. The POD framework, developed by Rawls and elaborated by O'Neill and Williamson (2012), Freeman (2013, 2018), and Thomas (2016), proposes dispersed capital ownership as alternative to welfare-state capitalism. POD aims to prevent domination and secure fair equality of opportunity through predistributive institutions that disperse ownership rather than redistributive transfers that leave ownership concentrated. Freeman (2018) emphasizes that POD is fundamentally about democratic reciprocity and self-respect—arrangements must be mutually justifiable among free and equal citizens, not merely produce particular distributional patterns.

Applied to housing, POD appears to favor dispersed homeownership as mechanism for distributing wealth and preventing domination. Erck (2024) develops "housing limitarianism" within a POD framework, arguing for wealth ceilings on housing ownership to disperse property throughout society. Her approach addresses quantity of housing owned—preventing individuals and corporations from acquiring excess homes while others lack adequate housing. Yet Erck does not address the core tension this research identifies: whether POD can justify housing price dynamics to affected parties. Even if ownership is widely dispersed, housing appreciation enriches current owners while excluding newcomers through unaffordability. Conversely, price suppression attacks incumbent owners' asset security that POD aims to provide.

Gregory (2016) provides trenchant critique of homeownership-based POD, arguing it creates anti-egalitarian dynamics rather than dispersing wealth. Examining UK and US contexts, he distinguishes conservative interpretations linking homeownership to virtuous citizenship and small-state ideology from subordinate egalitarian interpretations seeking solidarity through broader property ownership. Gregory contends the egalitarian reinterpretation is "politically and sociologically naïve"—homeownership-based POD generates anti-welfare politics as homeowners become a constituency defending asset values against redistributive policies. Historical analysis reveals this pattern: Jackson (2012) traces how "property-owning democracy" rhetoric has been periodically revived and redefined, with Margaret Thatcher's 1980s interpretation emphasizing homeownership expansion in explicitly anti-welfare terms.

The justifiability problem deepens when considering POD's core values. If POD requires arrangements supporting self-respect and reciprocity among citizens (Freeman 2018), housing policies that enrich some through appreciation while excluding others fail this test. Lister (2017) defends POD against welfarist critiques by arguing the difference principle should not require the present worst-off to accept inequality that doesn't benefit them for the sake of future generations who will be better off anyway. This time-indexed fairness requirement has direct implications: we cannot require current non-owners to accept unaffordable housing enabling incumbent owners' wealth accumulation on grounds that future policies will help future worst-off. Similarly, suppressing housing values to help current non-owners attacks the self-respect of those whose main asset is their home—the very concern POD prioritizes.

Thomas's (2016) synthesis of neo-republican political theory with Rawlsian justice emphasizes that POD structures economic incentives to make domination structurally impossible in markets. Yet housing's dual role creates domination in either direction: if housing appreciates, newcomers are dominated by being excluded from opportunity through unaffordability; if prices are suppressed, incumbent owners are dominated by policies that attack their primary source of security. White (2016) explores connections between republicanism and POD through non-domination, but applying this to housing reveals the structural bind: dispersed homeownership creates domination when prices fluctuate, yet preventing fluctuation requires controls that themselves constitute domination of property owners.

Halliday and Meyer's (2024) comprehensive survey of housing justice philosophy identifies this gap, arguing the field has given insufficient attention to macroeconomic dimensions of housing, particularly price dynamics and wealth accumulation via homeownership. They advocate for normative approaches beyond human flourishing and relational equality frameworks that can address distributive concerns directly—an opening for contractualist analysis. Yet their survey reveals no existing work that successfully resolves the dual-role problem or demonstrates how POD principles could justify either appreciation or suppression to all affected parties.

The contractualist critique exposes fundamental limits: housing's dual role under financialized conditions makes it impossible to satisfy reasonable acceptance requirements for all parties. POD's commitment to dispersed ownership as mechanism for preventing domination and securing reciprocity cannot be realized through housing when housing must simultaneously serve as affordable necessity and wealth store. Neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies contractualist standards, revealing a principled impasse rather than merely an implementation challenge. The dual-role problem thus represents not a gap in POD's application to housing but a domain where POD's justificatory requirements cannot be met.

**Section Summary**

These structural tensions—occupancy versus access, necessity versus asset—create contractualist deadlocks where protecting legitimate claims of some parties necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of others. The occupancy rights literature establishes robust grounds for incumbent protection but systematically neglects excluded outsiders who also need access to pursue life plans. Housing financialization transforms housing into the primary wealth accumulation mechanism for most households, creating a contradiction where appreciation serves owners but excludes newcomers while suppression helps affordability but attacks incumbent security. Property-owning democracy, when applied to housing, faces justifiability problems in both directions: neither price appreciation nor suppression can satisfy contractualist reasonable acceptance requirements for all affected parties.

Standard contractualist frameworks lack resources to resolve these tensions because they presume goods are commensurable and principles can be reciprocally justified to all affected parties. Housing violates both presumptions: location generates non-fungible value (Section 1), and structural contradictions create zero-sum conflicts where satisfying one party's claims requires violating another's. The literature documents each tension in rich detail but rarely frames them as contractualist problems requiring mutual justifiability. This framing reveals that housing justice may require distinctive theoretical treatment beyond general distributive principles—a theme developed further through intergenerational and epistemic dimensions in Section 3.


## Section 3: Intergenerational Justice and Epistemic Duties

Urban planning decisions bind future generations through irreversible commitments whose consequences unfold across decades. When present generations shape urban form—determining density patterns, transportation infrastructure, and housing configurations—they structure the material and social environments their successors will inhabit. Yet these long-term planning decisions confront a fundamental epistemic problem: we cannot know future generations' preferences, values, or conceptions of the good. Standard contractualist frameworks, premised on reciprocity and justification to affected parties, struggle with this temporal asymmetry. Future generations cannot participate in present deliberation, cannot reciprocate present sacrifices, and lack the social relations that ground many theories of justice. This section establishes that planning's irreversibility combined with epistemic uncertainty about future preferences generates distinctive obligations that contractualist theory has inadequately theorized. Drawing on epistemic justice frameworks and option-preservation approaches, it argues that contractualism requires resources for theorizing duties to future knowers—duties grounded not in reciprocity or social relations, but in avoiding epistemic harms to those whose interpretive capacities our decisions will constrain.

### Intergenerational Obligations Under Epistemic Uncertainty

Intergenerational justice theory confronts fundamental questions about whether and how present generations can owe duties to those not yet born. Traditional contractualist frameworks emphasize reciprocity: obligations arise from mutual advantage, fair cooperation, or reasonable agreement among parties who stand in social relations (Gosseries 2009). But non-overlapping generations lack these features. Future people cannot reciprocate present sacrifices, cannot participate in present agreements, and do not share contemporaneous social relations with us. This absence raises the question of whether contractualist obligations can extend across the temporal boundary separating generations.

Recent work on relational egalitarianism intensifies this challenge. Relational theories hold that justice requires not distributive patterns but equal social relationships—freedom from domination, equal civic standing, mutual recognition. Yet as Bengtson (2025) demonstrates, relational egalitarianism faces an "intergenerational justice dilemma" because future generations lack social relations in the relevant sense. Attempts to extend relational frameworks intergenerationally by weakening the notion of "social relations"—perhaps through chains of obligation, institutional connections, or community membership—encounter a systematic problem: either the relations become too thin to ground distinctively relational requirements, or they fail to support egalitarian rather than merely sufficientarian obligations. Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) reinforces this diagnosis through systematic evaluation of proposals for extending relational egalitarianism. Each attempt to redefine "social relations" to include non-overlapping generations faces the same dilemma: robust enough to matter but too weak to ground relational equality, or strong enough to ground equality but absent between non-overlapping generations.

These difficulties with reciprocity-based and relation-based theories suggest the need for alternative foundations for intergenerational obligations. Sufficientarian approaches offer one promising direction. Timmer (2024) defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for intergenerational contexts, arguing that freedom from deprivation in one generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another generation, while respecting the independence of different generations' claims. This threshold-based approach avoids both extreme prioritarianism (which could demand impoverishing the present for marginal future benefits) and weak sufficientarianism (which permits present affluence at the cost of future deprivation). Crucially, sufficientarian principles handle uncertainty about future preferences better than optimization-based approaches: while we cannot predict what future generations will prefer, we can identify deprivation thresholds—basic needs whose satisfaction remains necessary regardless of preference variation. This epistemic advantage makes sufficientarianism distinctively appropriate for intergenerational contexts where preference uncertainty is irreducible.

Option-preservation frameworks provide another alternative that responds directly to epistemic uncertainty. Zwarthoed (2016) argues that leaving future generations a world of artificial substitutes for nature—plastic trees and electronic birds—wrongs them even if these substitutes perfectly satisfy their preferences, because such a world fails to secure adequate options for autonomous choice. Drawing on autonomy-based theories, she contends we have duties to preserve genuine options not because future people will necessarily prefer them (we cannot know their preferences), but because adequate option-sets are necessary preconditions for autonomous choice. This distinction between option preservation and preference satisfaction is critical: even if we could predict future preferences accurately (we cannot), we would still owe them real choices rather than merely optimized outcomes. Uncertainty about future values thus strengthens rather than weakens the case for option preservation—precisely because we cannot know what they will value, we must preserve diverse options supporting multiple conceptions of the good.

Doorn (2025) applies this option-preservation framework to risk management contexts involving irreversibility. She argues that irreversible losses—environmental damage that cannot be remedied, species extinctions, climate tipping points—trigger particularly strong duties to avoid foreclosing options. When decisions have permanent consequences that bind future generations, and when we face epistemic uncertainty about future values, we have duties to preserve option-sets rather than optimize based on current assessments. Applied to urban planning, this framework suggests that irreversible decisions about urban form—highway locations that permanently structure mobility patterns, density configurations that determine social possibilities, infrastructure commitments that lock in energy systems—create strong duties to preserve diverse urban options rather than optimizing for present assumptions about future preferences.

Gough (2015) reinforces these arguments through a need-based theory of intergenerational obligations. He argues that need-theory provides objective, universalizable, and non-substitutable criteria that are epistemically more secure than preference-based approaches. While preferences are subjective, endogenous, and limitless—varying across individuals and contexts in ways we cannot predict—needs are necessary preconditions for avoiding serious harm across all contexts. This epistemic advantage is decisive for intergenerational obligations: we can identify universal needs (housing, mobility, health, public space) that constrain what we owe future generations, even when we cannot predict their particular preferences. Moreover, the satiability of needs provides principled constraints on present accumulation: once basic needs are met, further optimization is not morally required. For urban planning, this suggests threshold constraints on irreversible decisions—planning must preserve conditions adequate for meeting universal needs, even if optimization for predicted preferences remains epistemically impossible.

### Epistemic Justice and Planning Authority

Epistemic justice theory provides conceptual resources for understanding duties to future generations that do not require reciprocity or social relations. Fricker's (2007) foundational work distinguishes testimonial injustice—deflating someone's credibility due to prejudice—from hermeneutical injustice—lacking conceptual resources to interpret one's experiences due to marginalization from knowledge-generating practices. Both forms constitute distinctive wrongs because they damage people's epistemic agency, their capacities as knowers. Critically, epistemic harms need not depend on the structure of social relations in ways that justice as equal relationships does. We can wrong someone epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities or excluding their testimony, regardless of whether we stand in reciprocal relations with them.

Fricker (2013) extends epistemic justice to political legitimacy through republican theory. She argues that epistemic justice is constitutive of political freedom understood as non-domination: if citizens suffer testimonial or hermeneutical injustice, they cannot effectively contest political decisions because they lack either credibility or interpretive resources to articulate grievances. Epistemic injustice thus enables domination—the capacity of others to interfere arbitrarily in one's affairs. This connection between epistemic justice and political legitimacy has direct implications for planning authority. If legitimate political power requires that those subject to it can meaningfully contest decisions, and epistemic injustice disables such contestation, then planning decisions binding future generations while denying them epistemic standing may lack legitimacy. Future generations cannot contest present planning decisions not merely because they are absent, but also because—if we impose frameworks rather than preserve options—they will lack adequate hermeneutical resources to interpret and challenge the urban forms they inherit.

Medina (2013) develops the structural dimensions of epistemic injustice, introducing concepts directly relevant to planning contexts. He emphasizes credibility excess (not merely deficit)—dominant groups whose testimony receives unwarranted credibility—and develops "meta-lucidity," critical awareness of one's epistemic limitations. Epistemic injustice operates structurally through institutions that privilege certain frameworks while marginalizing others, with dominant groups actively resisting knowledge that threatens their privilege. Crucially, Medina argues that epistemic justice requires cultivating "epistemic friction"—discomfort prompting questioning of one's assumptions. This concept directly supports epistemic humility in long-term planning: recognizing that our interpretive resources are limited and potentially parochial should constrain optimization-based approaches that assume present frameworks adequately capture all relevant values.

Anderson (2012) shifts epistemic justice from individual virtue ethics to institutional design, arguing that social institutions exhibit epistemic justice or injustice through their testimonial gathering and assessment systems. Institutions that systematically exclude certain voices or fail to design mechanisms correcting for bias instantiate epistemic injustice. This institutional focus is essential for planning contexts where individual epistemic virtues cannot overcome structural biases. If epistemic justice requires institutional design that counteracts bias and includes diverse perspectives, then planning institutions making irreversible decisions about future urban form face distinctive epistemic duties. Such institutions must incorporate mechanisms for recognizing epistemic uncertainty about future values—not merely cultivating better individual epistemic virtues in planners, but creating institutional structures that preserve options precisely because the institution recognizes its epistemic limitations regarding future generations.

Byskov and Hyams (2023) demonstrate how epistemic injustice operates in long-term planning under uncertainty through analysis of climate adaptation policy. They show that adaptation planning systematically marginalizes Indigenous knowledges through testimonial injustice (credibility deficits due to prejudice) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to recognize Indigenous knowledge systems). While their focus is Indigenous knowledge, their framework illuminates how planning institutions systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others. Extended to intergenerational contexts: planning processes that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations. They inherit a world structured by our conceptual schemes without adequate resources to interpret or contest it—they suffer from hermeneutical marginalization we have imposed through irreversible decisions.

Halsband (2022) applies this analysis specifically to AI-supported optimization in long-term planning. She argues that decision-support systems used for climate policy embed controversial assumptions about social discounting and future preferences that significantly influence outcomes. By making these assumptions opaque and treating them as technical rather than normative, AI systems commit hermeneutical injustice: they structure decision-making using frameworks future generations cannot meaningfully interpret or contest. This critique extends directly to urban planning contexts where optimization models increasingly inform decisions about housing density, transportation infrastructure, and spatial development. When such models optimize based on assumptions about future preferences—assumptions necessarily contested given epistemic uncertainty—they impose present hermeneutical frameworks on future generations who inherit but cannot challenge them. Option-preservation approaches that acknowledge epistemic uncertainty may thus be more just than optimization approaches that embed contestable assumptions in technical systems.

### Epistemic Duties as Intergenerational Obligations

The convergence of intergenerational justice theory and epistemic justice frameworks suggests a novel foundation for duties to future generations—one that does not require reciprocity or social relations but grounds obligations in respect for future people's epistemic capacities. Chan (2025) provides a suggestive parallel through her defense of relational egalitarianism against intergenerational objections. She argues we owe future generations not merely resources but the capacity to relate to each other as equals, which requires transforming oppressive social categories (race, gender, class) that structure unequal relations. Failing to transform these categories constitutes a double wrong: unjust relations with contemporaries and wronging future people who inherit oppressive category-structures. The duty extends across non-overlapping generations because social categories persist intergenerationally even when particular relations do not.

Chan's capacity-preservation argument parallels the epistemic duties this section defends. Just as oppressive social categories constrain future people's capacity for equal relations, constraining interpretive frameworks and foreclosing option-sets constrains future people's epistemic capacities—their capacities as knowers. We wrong them epistemically by structuring a world they can interpret only through conceptual schemes we impose, denying them adequate hermeneutical resources to develop alternative interpretations. This epistemic harm does not require that we stand in social relations with them; it arises from our decisions determining their epistemic possibilities.

Applied to urban planning, the argument proceeds: irreversible planning decisions that foreclose options commit epistemic injustice when they constrain future generations' interpretive capacities. If present planning optimizes urban form based on assumptions about future preferences—assumptions necessarily uncertain—this optimization forecloses alternatives future people might have chosen under different interpretive frameworks. By locking in single optimized forms, we impose our hermeneutical frameworks on them, constraining their capacity to interpret and shape their environments according to values we cannot predict. This constitutes hermeneutical injustice: we marginalize them from knowledge-generating practices determining their urban environments, denying them epistemic standing in decisions that will structure their lives.

McCauley et al. (2018) demonstrate the practical relevance of these theoretical concerns through analysis of energy infrastructure decisions. They identify three dimensions of energy justice—distributional (how costs/benefits are allocated), procedural (who participates in decision-making), and recognition (respect for diverse values and knowledge systems)—emphasizing that energy infrastructure is long-lived, capital-intensive, and path-dependent, creating lock-in effects that constrain future options. This framework transfers directly to urban planning, which shares these characteristics. The recognition dimension is especially relevant: if justice requires recognizing diverse values and knowledge systems, this supports preserving options for future generations whose values we cannot adequately represent within present frameworks. When infrastructure decisions (energy or urban) bind future generations through path dependencies, epistemic justice demands preserving interpretive capacity rather than optimizing based on present frameworks.

Green and Brandstedt (2020) strengthen this conclusion through methodological critique. They argue that "principles-first" approaches to climate ethics—deriving action-guidance by applying general principles to empirical facts—are indeterminate under genuine epistemic uncertainty. Such approaches leave open crucial normative choices because they require contestable assumptions about future values that cannot be resolved through philosophical analysis alone. This critique applies to optimization-based planning: under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future preferences, principles-first optimization approaches necessarily embed contested assumptions. Rather than pretending we can derive determinate solutions through philosophical principles, we should acknowledge irreducible normative uncertainty and preserve options precisely because we cannot resolve these normative questions on behalf of future generations.

The fourth failing of standard contractualist frameworks thus becomes clear: they inadequately theorize epistemic duties to future generations under conditions of irreversibility and uncertainty. Standard contractualism emphasizes reciprocity, reasonable agreement, and justification to affected parties—structures that seem unavailable intergenerationally. But epistemic justice provides alternative foundations. We have duties not to constrain future people's epistemic capacities through irreversible decisions made under epistemic uncertainty about their values. These duties do not require that future people reciprocate, participate in agreements, or stand in social relations with us. They arise from recognition that our decisions determine their epistemic possibilities—the hermeneutical frameworks and option-sets available for autonomous interpretation of their circumstances.

For contractualist housing justice, this analysis generates principled constraints on planning authority. When planning decisions about urban form are irreversible—determining density patterns, infrastructure locations, housing configurations that will persist across generations—and when we face epistemic uncertainty about future preferences, contractualist justification requires preserving options rather than optimizing. We cannot justify irreversible optimization to future generations because such optimization necessarily embeds assumptions about their values we cannot know. But we can justify preserving adequate option-sets: this respects their epistemic standing by maintaining interpretive capacity rather than foreclosing it. The contractualist move is not abandoning justification under uncertainty, but recognizing what justification demands—epistemic humility that constrains present authority precisely because we cannot know what future generations will reasonably reject.

## Section 4: Alternative Normative Frameworks

Having established housing's distinctive features—non-fungible locational value, competing legitimate claims creating structural deadlocks, and intergenerational epistemic duties—we must position contractualism against alternative normative approaches. Rights-based frameworks, capabilities theories, and relational egalitarianism each offer resources for housing justice, and each faces distinctive challenges. Understanding these alternatives clarifies what contractualist approaches must explain that competing frameworks cannot, and where contractualism may require integration with these approaches. This section surveys the three major alternatives, emphasizing their analytical strengths and identifying where they leave gaps that motivate contractualist treatment.

### 4.1 Rights-Based Approaches

Rights-based frameworks ground housing claims in dignity, autonomy, or basic needs, offering strong normative protections independent of social welfare calculations. Wells (2019) develops perhaps the most sophisticated recent defense of housing rights, arguing for a positive right to exercise "lease rights" over a self-contained living space of adequate standard for a minimum of three years. Crucially, Wells argues this is a right to autonomous dwelling—not merely shelter—emphasizing stable, private housing that individuals control. Her account grounds housing rights in individual autonomy: having one's own dwelling space is constitutive of the conditions for autonomous agency, not merely instrumentally valuable. Wells explicitly defends this as a right to live alone; communal housing imposed by resource scarcity violates basic rights even if it provides adequate shelter. The temporal dimension (minimum three years) recognizes that housing's value depends on stability—short-term shelter fails to provide the conditions for autonomous life-planning that ground the right.

Shue's (2020) updated edition of *Basic Rights* provides broader theoretical foundations, arguing that subsistence rights including adequate housing are "morally basic" because their enjoyment is essential to enjoying all other rights. Subsistence rights stand alongside security and liberty as foundational: without adequate housing, individuals cannot effectively exercise political, economic, or social rights. Shue's framework makes housing rights conceptually prior to other distributive concerns—they are not outcomes of optimization over competing claims but preconditions for participation in social and political life. The 40th anniversary edition includes new material on climate change progressively undermining subsistence bases, adding urgency to housing rights claims. As climate impacts displace populations and destroy housing stock, basic rights frameworks provide moral foundations for protection and relocation obligations.

Essert (2016) addresses the relationship between property institutions and homelessness, arguing that private property systems that fail to ensure everyone has access to shelter are morally deficient. His analysis focuses on what justifies the state's enforcement of property rights against those experiencing homelessness. The state may legitimately exclude homeless persons from private property only if genuine alternative shelter is available. Property rights, on Essert's account, carry correlative obligations: a property regime is justified only insofar as it ensures basic shelter access for all. This connects property theory to housing justice by making adequate housing provision a condition for legitimate property institutions.

Rights-based approaches offer several advantages. They provide strong moral protections that resist consequentialist trade-offs—basic rights are not negotiable against aggregate welfare gains. They ground housing claims in fundamental values (dignity, autonomy, subsistence) that command broad recognition across liberal democratic societies. And they offer clear action-guidance: rights generate correlative duties specifying what states and individuals owe to others. Wells's emphasis on autonomous dwelling rather than mere shelter, for instance, provides specific content about housing quality and security that generic "right to housing" claims lack.

However, rights frameworks face three persistent challenges. First, **content specification**: how much housing, of what quality, in what locations does the right entail? Wells addresses this through the autonomous dwelling standard (self-contained, private, adequate, three years minimum), but questions remain about whether location matters. Does the right to housing entail a right to live in high-opportunity areas, or may the state satisfy the right by providing adequate housing in low-opportunity locations? If location generates non-fungible value through agglomeration mechanisms (as Section 1 established), then treating housing rights as location-neutral may systematically disadvantage rights-holders by excluding them from productive regions. But if rights extend to high-opportunity locations, how should we adjudicate competing claims when housing supply is constrained?

Second, **trade-offs and rights conflicts**: housing rights inevitably conflict with other rights—property rights of current owners, development rights, mobility rights, environmental preservation. Rights frameworks struggle to specify how such conflicts should be resolved without introducing consequentialist balancing that undermines rights' non-negotiable status. Erck's (2024) housing limitarianism—arguing it is morally wrong to own excess housing while others lack adequate housing—illustrates this tension. If governments should limit excessive housing acquisition to ensure adequate housing for all, this restricts property rights to protect housing rights. Rights-based frameworks must either accept lexical priority orderings (which seem implausible given value pluralism) or introduce balancing procedures that threaten to collapse rights into flexible interests.

Third, **institutional design and feasibility**: rights generate obligations, but specifying who bears correlative duties and through what institutions remains contested. Does the housing right entail obligations on governments to provide housing directly, to regulate markets to ensure affordability, or merely to refrain from interference with housing access? Essert's focus on property institutions points toward systemic analysis, but rights frameworks generally remain underspecified about institutional arrangements. As Halliday and Meyer (2024) note, philosophical housing literature has inadequately engaged with macroeconomic policy dimensions—fiscal policy, monetary policy, credit markets—that shape housing access. Rights-based approaches may identify what is owed without explaining how institutions should deliver it.

### 4.2 Capabilities and Conversion Factors

Capabilities approaches shift focus from resources or rights to what people are actually able to do and be—their functionings and freedoms. Kimhur (2024) develops the most systematic recent capabilities approach to housing, proposing evaluation through three dimensions: housing opportunities (real options for choosing housing), housing securities (stability and protection), and housing abilities (capacities to maintain and improve housing situations). This framework emphasizes changes in people's capabilities for valued ways of residing rather than distributional patterns of housing units or resources. Housing justice, on Kimhur's account, requires expanding the capabilities people have regarding housing, not merely providing housing units or equalizing housing consumption.

The capabilities approach offers several advantages over resource-based frameworks. It recognizes that the same housing resources generate different capabilities depending on personal characteristics and social contexts—what Sen (1985) calls "conversion factors." Location serves as a crucial environmental conversion factor: identical housing units generate radically different capabilities depending on whether they are located in high-opportunity or low-opportunity regions. A dwelling in a productive agglomeration provides capabilities for employment, education, civic participation, and social networks that the same dwelling in an isolated location cannot. By focusing on conversion factors, capabilities approaches seem well-positioned to handle housing's location-specific value that challenges fungibility assumptions.

Batterham (2020) identifies three methodological challenges capabilities approaches must address in housing contexts. First, the process for deriving and specifying housing-related capabilities must be clear and defensible—which capabilities matter for housing justice and why? Second, there must be explicit connection between the concept of justice and housing capabilities—why do capability deprivations constitute injustices rather than merely unfortunate shortfalls? Third, different understandings of what causes capability deprivation have significant implications for policy responses—is inadequate housing capability due to individual circumstances, institutional failures, or structural conditions? These methodological questions demand resolution for capabilities approaches to realize their promise in housing policy.

Dummer and Neuhäuser (2025) press further, arguing that pure capabilities approaches inadequately capture housing justice concerns and require integration with relational egalitarian considerations. Examining Nussbaum's list of basic capabilities, they contend the list misses fundamental relational dimensions of housing. They develop self-respect as a basic capability that necessarily incorporates relational elements: one's housing situation affects one's standing in social relations and one's capacity for self-respect depends on how housing positions one relative to others. An adequate capabilitarian view must address these relational aspects, not merely individual functionings. This critique suggests capabilities approaches need supplementation from relational frameworks to handle housing's social and civic dimensions.

The capabilities framework thus faces a persistent question: does it escape the fungibility assumption or merely relocate it? If capabilities themselves are commensurable—if we can trade housing capabilities against other capabilities via some master metric—then the fungibility problem reappears at the capability level. Housing's location-specific value becomes invisible if capabilities frameworks treat capabilities for employment, education, civic participation, and social networks as fungible with capabilities achievable through other means. But if housing-related capabilities are non-fungible, capabilities approaches need principles for adjudicating conflicts among non-commensurable capabilities. How should we balance capabilities for housing security (favoring incumbent protection) against capabilities for accessing high-opportunity locations (favoring newcomer access) when these conflict?

Taylor (2020) suggests that Rawlsian justice frameworks might contribute to capabilities-based housing policy evaluation rather than competing with it, proposing integration between approaches. But the relationship between capabilities and contractualist principles requires clarification. Can contractualist reasonable rejection criteria specify which capabilities matter most and how to prioritize among them? Or do capabilities approaches offer resources—attention to conversion factors, focus on actual freedoms—that contractualist frameworks should incorporate?

### 4.3 Relational Equality and Domination

Relational egalitarian approaches emphasize social standing, domination, and hierarchical relationships rather than distributive patterns. Cass (2023, 2024) develops relational equality's implications for housing with particular attention to civic status. He argues that relational equality has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions: civic status depends on one's relative standing and unfolds over time through participation in civic life. Housing matters for relational equality not merely because inadequate housing causes absolute deprivation but because residential segregation creates hierarchical civic status incompatible with relating as equals. Even if all citizens meet absolute housing standards, systematic residential segregation by income or race creates civic hierarchy that violates relational equality.

This positional dimension connects to Section 1's discussion of positional goods. Cass contends that relational equality requires relatively equal access to location-based civic participation opportunities. If high-opportunity locations provide dramatically better platforms for civic engagement—through better schools, stronger social networks, proximity to political institutions—then excluding some citizens from these locations creates civic inequality. Housing location is thus not merely an individual welfare concern but a relational equality issue: where people live determines their civic standing and their ability to participate as equals in collective self-governance.

Jenkins (2022) analyzes gentrification through the republican freedom framework as domination—arbitrary interference by landlords and developers that undermines residents' freedom as non-domination. Gentrification creates relationships of domination when property owners can arbitrarily raise rents, convert uses, or displace residents without meaningful constraints. The state's role in facilitating gentrification through zoning changes, development incentives, and failure to protect tenants constitutes state-enabled domination. Wells (2021) extends this analysis to state-led gentrification's expressive harms, arguing that government-initiated displacement communicates that displaced residents have inferior civic standing, damaging self-respect and equal standing independently of material losses.

Dawkins (2023) provides the most comprehensive recent taxonomy of gentrification injustices, identifying eight distinct forms: deprivation (material losses), estrangement (loss of place attachment), erasure (destruction of community memory), domination (arbitrary interference), censure (moral judgment of residents), exploitation (extraction of value), disrespect (failure to recognize standing), and marginalization (exclusion from public space and civic life). Notably, domination appears both as a distinct injustice and as contributing to other forms—landlords' arbitrary power enables exploitation and marginalization, while state decisions embody disrespect. Dawkins argues the state has ultimate moral obligation to rectify these plural injustices through institutional reform, not merely to blame individual actors.

Lloyd (2023) argues that philosophical critiques of gentrification have overemphasized residential displacement while neglecting non-displacement harms. Drawing on social science evidence, he contends that gentrification damages thriving communities even when original residents remain, by undermining the goods conferred through community membership. This community-centered critique grounds objections to gentrification in occupancy rights derived from communal labor: residents who have invested in building community infrastructure (social networks, mutual aid systems, cultural institutions) have rights to remain and to protect those community goods from destruction. Gentrification violates these rights by destroying community goods even when individuals retain their housing.

Relational approaches offer important resources for housing justice. They capture housing's civic and community dimensions that distributive frameworks may miss. They explain why housing location matters for justice—not merely because of opportunity access but because of civic standing and non-domination. And they connect to occupancy rights literature by grounding incumbent claims in relational goods rather than mere preference or attachment.

However, relational frameworks face the intergenerational challenge noted in Section 3. Relational equality and non-domination depend on social relationships—relating as equals, freedom from arbitrary interference. But future generations do not yet stand in social relations with us, so relational theories struggle to ground obligations to them. If relational equality requires preventing present civic hierarchies but permits creating future ones through irreversible planning decisions, the framework seems incomplete. Bengtson (2025) and Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) develop this "intergenerational justice dilemma" for relational approaches: obligations based on relating as equals seemingly cannot extend to non-overlapping generations who never relate at all.

Pettit (2012) distinguishes between legitimacy (how coercion is imposed) and justice (what order is imposed), arguing that legitimacy requires non-domination rather than hypothetical consent. This move potentially creates space for contractualist integration: perhaps non-domination specifies necessary conditions for legitimacy while contractualist reasonable rejection specifies sufficient conditions for justice. But the relationship between these frameworks requires clarification.

### 4.4 Positioning Contractualism

These alternative frameworks each illuminate aspects of housing justice while facing distinctive limitations. Rights approaches provide strong protections grounded in dignity and autonomy but struggle with content specification, rights conflicts, and institutional design. Capabilities approaches recognize conversion factors and focus on real freedoms but face questions about whether they escape fungibility at the capability level and how to prioritize incommensurable capabilities. Relational approaches capture housing's civic and community dimensions but struggle to ground intergenerational obligations in the absence of social relations.

Contractualist frameworks must explain what they offer that these alternatives cannot. Three possibilities emerge. First, contractualist reasonable rejection criteria may provide principled grounds for specifying housing rights content, adjudicating rights conflicts, and designing institutions—what reasonable persons could not reject constrains how we specify and implement housing rights. Second, contractualism may offer resources for prioritizing among capabilities when they conflict: perhaps the capabilities people need most are those without which their claims could be reasonably rejected. Third, contractualist frameworks may extend to intergenerational contexts through epistemic duties (as Section 3 argued) rather than relational obligations, avoiding the intergenerational justice dilemma that plagues relational approaches.

Alternatively, contractualism may require integration with these frameworks rather than replacement. Perhaps rights, capabilities, and relational equality specify what reasonable persons could not reject in different domains—rights for basic needs, capabilities for opportunity, relational equality for civic standing—and contractualist principles coordinate among these considerations. Halliday and Meyer's (2024) call for normative frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality suggests space for contractualist contributions, but whether contractualism offers a comprehensive alternative or a complementary framework remains an open question that the housing justice project must address.


## Research Gaps and Opportunities

This review has mapped substantial literatures across eight domains—contractualist foundations, non-fungible goods, occupancy rights, property-owning democracy, intergenerational justice, urban economics, housing systems, and applied housing ethics. Yet systematic gaps remain at their intersections, gaps that reveal both the limitations of existing approaches and opportunities for advancing housing justice theory. Five major gaps structure the space this research project aims to address.

### Gap 1: Contractualist Application to Housing

Despite contractualism's prominence in political philosophy, its systematic application to housing remains underdeveloped. Halliday and Meyer (2024) identify the need for normative frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality, yet neither Rawlsian nor Scanlonian contractualism has been systematically applied to housing's distinctive features. The contractualist foundations literature (Domain 1) shows minimal engagement with housing, property regimes, or land use regulation. Rawls's primary goods framework treats income and wealth as fungible resources without addressing whether housing in particular locations fits this model (Rawls 1971, 2001). Freeman's authoritative interpretations of the difference principle and property-owning democracy (2013, 2018) develop institutional implications but do not examine housing specifically. Scanlon's reasonable rejectability criterion (1998) offers resources for evaluating housing policies that affect place-attachment, yet neither Scanlon nor his interpreters have applied contractualism to displacement, gentrification, or housing allocation.

The applied housing ethics literature (Domain 8) relies primarily on human rights (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), capabilities (Kimhur 2024), or relational equality frameworks (Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025). Wells defends a right to autonomous dwelling grounded in autonomy rather than contractualist justification. Kimhur's capabilities approach focuses on housing opportunities, securities, and abilities without examining whether these arrangements satisfy reasonable acceptance standards. No systematic work examines whether housing policies treating occupancy as fungible with compensation, or allowing appreciation to exclude newcomers, could be reasonably rejected by those burdened.

This gap matters because housing involves direct state coercion—eminent domain, zoning, displacement—requiring justification to all affected parties, precisely the domain where contractualist reasonable rejection should apply. Yet the four failings this review has documented suggest standard contractualist frameworks lack resources to address housing's non-fungible value, competing legitimate claims, dual-role contradictions, and epistemic duties under uncertainty. Contractualist theory has not developed tools for goods where location constitutes rather than merely affects value, where protection of some necessarily excludes others, where asset and necessity functions contradict, or where irreversible decisions bind future generations whose preferences remain epistemically opaque.

**Research contribution**: This project develops contractualist frameworks specifically for housing by identifying where standard approaches fail (the four failings) and what resources contractualism needs to address them. It examines whether Rawlsian or Scanlonian contractualism, properly developed, can handle housing's distinctive features, or whether housing reveals principled limits to contractualist justification.

### Gap 2: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Literature

The urban economics literature on agglomeration externalities (Domain 6) operates independently from philosophical distributive justice debates, while housing systems research (Domain 7) documents financialization empirically but lacks normative analysis. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) quantify massive aggregate costs from housing constraints preventing efficient spatial sorting—a 36 percent GDP growth loss from 1964 to 2009—yet do not engage with justice theories that might evaluate these costs normatively. Duranton and Puga (2004) establish that agglomeration mechanisms (sharing, matching, learning) create location-specific value through irreducible spatial proximity, yet their analysis remains economic efficiency-focused without addressing fungibility assumptions in distributive justice frameworks. Ganong and Shoag (2017) document how housing costs redirected low-skill migration away from opportunity-rich locations, ending regional income convergence, but do not examine whether this violates any principles of fair opportunity access.

Conversely, philosophical housing justice literature (Domain 8) rarely engages macroeconomic evidence, as Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe. The occupancy rights literature (Domain 3) develops robust philosophical grounds for incumbent protection (Stilz 2019, Huber and Wolkenstein 2018, Lloyd 2023) without incorporating spatial misallocation findings showing aggregate costs of constraints that protect occupancy by limiting supply. The capabilities approach to housing (Kimhur 2024) emphasizes conversion factors but does not systematically engage agglomeration theory showing how location constitutes rather than merely converts productivity gains. Property-owning democracy literature (Domain 4) addresses wealth dispersal abstractly (Freeman 2013, Thomas 2016) but Gregory (2016) notes homeownership-based POD has created anti-egalitarian dynamics that empirical housing financialization studies document in detail (Fikse and Aalbers 2020, Ryan-Collins 2019).

This disconnect matters because normative principles must address actual housing dynamics—financialization, agglomeration, spatial sorting—not idealized markets. Philosophical analysis detached from institutional reality lacks policy relevance, while empirical analysis without normative frameworks cannot evaluate which costs and benefits matter for justice. The gap is particularly acute regarding housing's dual role: political economy research documents the structural contradiction between housing as affordable necessity and wealth store (Fikse and Aalbers 2020, Ryan-Collins 2019, Fuller et al. 2019), yet philosophers have not examined whether any housing price policy (appreciation or suppression) can meet contractualist reasonable acceptance standards when this contradiction obtains.

**Research contribution**: This project synthesizes agglomeration economics showing non-fungible locational value, housing financialization literature revealing dual-role contradictions, and contractualist principles to develop an integrated framework. It asks whether contractualist justification can accommodate empirical findings that location generates non-exportable productivity gains while housing financialization creates structural tensions between asset and necessity functions.

### Gap 3: The Occupancy/Access Deadlock

The occupancy rights literature has developed sophisticated accounts of incumbent claims grounded in located life plans (Stilz 2019), autonomous dwelling (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018), community goods (Lloyd 2023), and relational equality (Dawkins 2023). These frameworks establish that displacement wrongs residents by disrupting the background conditions enabling their plans, relationships, and standing. Recent work recognizes that gentrification harms extend beyond displacement to include neighborhood transformation, democratic participation threats, and domination (Draper 2022, Jenkins 2022, Wells 2021). Yet van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey confirms the field focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection with minimal attention to newcomer or excluded access claims.

Mancilla (2020) provides rare critical attention, noting that occupancy theory privileges settled over mobile populations, systematically disadvantaging those whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. But Mancilla does not fully develop how to balance located and dynamic occupancy when they conflict—when protecting settled residents necessarily excludes mobile populations from accessing opportunity. Bonotti and Barnhill (2022) recognize that newcomers develop occupancy interests that conflict with incumbent claims, proposing scaled protections by advantage level, but do not address the contractualist question: how can differential treatment based on group membership be justified to those disadvantaged by it? Kim and Walton (2022) attempt regulatory balance between occupancy protection and mobility rights, yet without examining whether proposed arrangements satisfy reasonable acceptance by both incumbents facing displacement pressure and newcomers denied access.

No papers directly frame the tension as a contractualist problem: we have competing legitimate claims that cannot both be fully satisfied under scarce housing conditions. Contractualism should provide tools for resolving or at least clarifying such conflicts where protection of some necessarily violates others' equally legitimate claims. Stilz's occupancy framework grounds territorial rights in individuals' located autonomy interests, but how can occupancy-based principles that protect incumbents' place-stability be justified to excluded outsiders who also need access to place to pursue their life plans? If both incumbents and excluded outsiders have legitimate claims grounded in autonomy, and constraints prevent satisfying both, what principles can adjudicate between them?

The urban economics literature intensifies this tension: if high-productivity locations generate non-exportable agglomeration benefits (Hsieh and Moretti 2019, Duranton and Puga 2004), excluded workers suffer opportunity costs that cannot be compensated through access to lower-productivity locations. Ganong and Shoag (2017) document that housing constraints redirected low-skill workers away from high-wage cities, systematically disadvantaging those who would most benefit from access. This creates a distributive pattern where occupancy protection concentrates opportunity among incumbents while excluding those with strongest claims to opportunity access—yet occupancy literature does not address how to justify this outcome to the excluded.

**Research contribution**: This project frames the occupancy/access tension as a contractualist impasse requiring principles justifiable to both incumbents and excluded outsiders, not merely incumbent protection. It examines whether any principles can satisfy reasonable acceptance by both parties when scarcity prevents full satisfaction of both claims, or whether housing reveals principled limits where contractualist justification reaches its bounds.

### Gap 4: Epistemic Duties in Planning

Intergenerational justice literature addresses preference uncertainty regarding future generations (Gosseries 2009, Timmer 2024), while epistemic justice literature examines testimonial and hermeneutical injustices against marginalized groups (Fricker 2007, Medina 2013, Anderson 2012). Yet their intersection—epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority—remains largely untheorized. Urban planning decisions create long-lived path dependencies through infrastructure, density patterns, and land use regulations that bind future generations irreversibly (McCauley et al. 2018), yet under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future preferences.

Zwarthoed (2016) and Doorn (2025) gesture toward option preservation under uncertainty, arguing we owe future generations adequate choice-sets rather than optimized outcomes based on predicted preferences. However, they do not develop full epistemic justice foundations for this duty. Fricker (2007) and Medina (2013) analyze how epistemic injustice wrongs people specifically as knowers through credibility deficits and lacking interpretive resources, yet focus on contemporaneous relationships. Anderson (2012) extends epistemic justice to institutional design, arguing institutions can exhibit epistemic injustice through systematically excluding voices or failing to correct bias, but does not address intergenerational contexts where future people cannot provide testimony.

Byskov and Hyams (2023) apply epistemic injustice to climate adaptation planning, showing how decision-making frameworks systematically privilege certain epistemic perspectives while marginalizing others. Halsband (2022) demonstrates that AI-supported optimization in long-term planning embeds contestable assumptions about future preferences, committing a form of hermeneutical injustice by imposing present interpretive frameworks on future generations who cannot contest them. Yet neither paper develops how epistemic duties to future knowers might constrain present planning authority regarding irreversible urban form decisions.

The relational egalitarian approach to intergenerational justice faces difficulties: Bengtson (2025) and Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) argue relational egalitarianism's "intergenerational justice dilemma" arises because non-overlapping generations lack social relations in the relevant sense, making it unclear how relational principles extend intergenerationally. Chan (2025) proposes that we owe future generations capacity to relate as equals by transforming oppressive social categories, yet this still requires some basis for cross-generational obligations. If relational approaches founder on temporal non-overlap, what alternative grounds intergenerational duties?

This gap matters because planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities may wrong future generations in a distinctive way—not merely by failing to maximize their welfare, but by constraining their epistemic capacities to interpret and contest the arrangements they inherit. If we cannot know future preferences and our conceptual schemes may prove parochial, epistemic humility should constrain optimization-based planning. Yet standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize such epistemic constraints, focusing instead on hypothetical choice behind veils of ignorance (Rawls) or reasonable rejection given actual circumstances (Scanlon) that presume determinacy about what reasonable persons would accept.

**Research contribution**: This project develops epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority, using epistemic justice frameworks (Fricker, Medina, Anderson) extended intergenerationally via capacity-preservation arguments (Chan). It examines whether epistemic approaches provide grounds for duties that do not require social relations or reciprocity, potentially succeeding where relational approaches fail. The argument contends that planning decisions constraining future generations' interpretive capacities through irreversible urban form constitute epistemic injustice requiring justification, yet such justification may be impossible under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future values.

### Gap 5: Housing's Dual Role Under Contractualism

Housing systems literature documents empirically that financialized homeownership creates a fundamental contradiction: housing must appreciate to serve as wealth store, yet appreciation systematically destroys affordability (Fikse and Aalbers 2020). Ryan-Collins (2019, 2021) traces the housing-finance feedback cycle created by pro-homeownership policy plus credit liberalization, where housing became the most attractive collateral for banks and most desirable asset for households, creating structural necessity for appreciation. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics, not income or homeownership rates, because appreciation enriches owners while excluding non-owners. Christophers (2019) argues tenure inequality—systematic privileging of ownership over rental—is the root cause of housing wealth inequality.

Property-owning democracy literature addresses dispersed ownership abstractly, arguing POD prevents domination and secures opportunity through predistribution (O'Neill and Williamson 2012, Freeman 2013, Thomas 2016). Freeman (2018) emphasizes democratic reciprocity and self-respect as central to POD, not merely distributive patterns. Erck (2024) develops housing limitarianism within POD framework, arguing for wealth ceilings on housing ownership. Yet Gregory (2016) shows empirically that homeownership-based POD has failed egalitarian aims, creating anti-egalitarian dynamics as housing appreciation concentrates wealth. Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe philosophical literature has inadequately addressed macroeconomic dimensions of housing and price dynamics.

No work systematically examines whether any housing price policy can meet contractualist reasonable acceptance standards when housing serves this dual role. If housing must function simultaneously as affordable necessity and wealth store under financialized conditions, yet appreciation undermines affordability while suppression attacks security, can any policy satisfy reasonable rejection criteria for all affected parties? Consider the dilemma from each position:

From incumbent owners' perspective: Housing often constitutes households' primary asset, particularly for middle-class and working-class homeowners. Policies suppressing housing values (to improve affordability for newcomers) attack the asset-based security POD aims to provide. Since POD justifies dispersed property ownership partly to secure independence and self-respect (Freeman 2018), owners could reasonably reject principles that deliberately undermine their main asset's value. The "really big contradiction" (Fikse and Aalbers 2020) suggests that once housing becomes financialized as wealth store, policies attacking appreciation may be unreasonably burdensome to those who relied on housing as retirement security or intergenerational wealth transfer.

From excluded newcomers' perspective: Housing appreciation that enriches incumbent owners necessarily prices out potential newcomers, particularly low-wealth households. If location provides non-exportable productivity gains through agglomeration (Hsieh and Moretti 2019), exclusion from high-productivity cities imposes unreasonable opportunity costs. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing costs redirected low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich locations, ending income convergence. Excluded workers could reasonably reject principles allowing housing appreciation that systematically concentrates opportunity among incumbents while denying access to those who would benefit most. The dual-role structure makes appreciation-enabling policies unreasonably burdensome to excluded outsiders.

This creates a contractualist impasse: neither appreciation nor suppression can satisfy reasonable acceptance by both owners and non-owners when housing functions simultaneously as necessity and asset. POD literature has not examined this tension: can property-owning democracy be achieved through dispersed homeownership when that very dispersion creates dual-role contradictions? Gregory's (2016) empirical finding that homeownership-based POD failed egalitarian aims suggests the structural problem, yet no philosophical analysis examines whether this failure reflects principled limits of contractualist justification rather than merely implementation challenges.

Kemeny's (1981) distinction between dualist and unitary housing systems suggests structural design choices may affect whether dual-role tension is tractable. Dualist systems (where social rental is residualized and competes with homeownership) may intensify contradictions by making homeownership the only secure tenure. Unitary systems (where non-profit and private rental compete, with homeownership less dominant) may ease tension by providing quality rental alternatives, allowing housing to serve necessity function without requiring appreciation. Yet philosophical literature has not examined whether tenure neutrality (Christophers 2019) or system-level design can resolve contractualist justifiability problems, or whether dual-role contradictions persist across system types under financialized conditions.

**Research contribution**: This project tests POD against contractualist justifiability standards when applied to housing, showing that dual-role problems create principled impasses where neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies reasonable rejection criteria for all affected parties. It examines whether any institutional design—POD via homeownership, POD via alternative asset forms, unitary rental systems with tenure neutrality, or hybrid approaches—can mediate this tension under financialized conditions. The analysis reveals whether housing's dual role represents merely difficult trade-offs requiring institutional ingenuity, or principled limits to contractualist justification where no arrangements can be justified to all affected parties.

### Synthesis and Research Positioning

These five gaps collectively reveal that housing justice requires distinctive theoretical treatment beyond general distributive principles. Housing's non-fungible location-specific value, competing occupancy and access claims, dual-role contradictions, and irreversible path dependencies binding future generations create challenges that standard contractualist frameworks inadequately address. The gaps are not merely empirical (we need more data) or applied (we need better policies), but theoretical: existing normative frameworks lack resources for goods where value is location-constituted, where protecting some necessarily excludes others, where necessity and asset functions contradict, and where epistemic uncertainty about future preferences constrains present optimization.

This research contributes by: (1) applying contractualist frameworks systematically to housing, examining both Rawlsian political contractualism and Scanlonian moral contractualism regarding housing's distinctive features; (2) integrating empirical evidence on agglomeration and financialization with normative contractualist analysis, showing how location-specific productivity gains and dual-role contradictions create justification challenges; (3) framing occupancy/access as contractualist impasse requiring principles justifiable to both incumbents and excluded outsiders, not merely incumbent protection; (4) developing epistemic duties for intergenerational planning through extending epistemic justice frameworks to future generations via capacity-preservation arguments; and (5) testing POD's limits when housing serves dual roles, examining whether appreciation or suppression can satisfy reasonable rejection criteria.

The expected contribution is not a comprehensive solution to housing justice—the four failings documented suggest contractualism may reach principled limits in housing contexts. Rather, the project aims for clearer analysis of where contractualist justification succeeds, where it faces difficulties, and what normative resources (from capabilities, rights, or relational frameworks) might supplement contractualist principles. If housing reveals that some policies cannot be justified to all affected parties because legitimate claims conflict irreducibly, this clarifies both contractualism's scope and housing's distinctive moral status. Understanding these limits is itself a significant contribution, revealing what housing justice requires beyond contractualist tools and what institutional innovations might address dual-role contradictions, occupancy/access trade-offs, and intergenerational epistemic duties that contractualism alone cannot resolve.


## Conclusion

This review has established that housing justice poses systematic challenges to standard contractualist frameworks, revealing four interconnected failings that require either theoretical innovation or recognition of contractualism's limits. These failings are not merely gaps in application but reflect deep tensions between contractualism's core commitments and housing's distinctive features.

First, the fungibility assumption implicit in dominant contractualist metrics fails when confronted with location-specific value. Rawls's primary goods framework treats goods as "all-purpose means" valuable across diverse life plans, enabling index-based comparisons through abstraction from particular attachments (Rawls 1971, 2001). Dworkin's equality of resources similarly depends on fungibility via hypothetical auctions and envy tests (Dworkin 1981). Yet agglomeration economics demonstrates that location generates non-exportable productive value through mechanisms—knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, shared infrastructure—that cannot be replicated elsewhere (Duranton and Puga 2004). Hsieh and Moretti (2019) quantify the magnitude: housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities lowered US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009 by preventing workers from accessing locations where agglomeration externalities would raise their productivity. This is not merely a conversion factor problem addressable through capabilities approaches; it reveals that location constitutes rather than converts value. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing constraints ended regional income convergence by redirecting low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich locations, demonstrating that location-specific value is both substantial and differentially accessible. When goods resist commensuration through any shared metric—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—standard contractualist frameworks lack adequate tools for evaluating their distribution.

Second, the occupancy versus access deadlock creates a contractualist impasse where protecting legitimate claims of one group necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of another. Stilz's (2019) occupancy rights framework grounds territorial rights in individuals' located autonomy interests, establishing that incumbents have weighty claims to remain where life plans are anchored. Extended to gentrification and urban neighborhoods, occupancy theory provides rich resources for understanding incumbent protection (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018; Lloyd 2023; Dawkins 2023). Yet as van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey confirms, the literature systematically neglects excluded outsiders' access claims. Mancilla (2020) notes that occupancy theory privileges settled over mobile populations, failing to address how protection for incumbents can be justified to those who need access to pursue their own located life plans. This is paradigmatic contractualist territory—competing claims that cannot both be fully satisfied—yet contractualism offers no clear resolution. Principles protecting occupancy cannot be justified to excluded workers facing spatial misallocation (Hsieh and Moretti 2019); principles prioritizing access cannot be justified to vulnerable incumbents facing displacement. The deadlock reflects not insufficient philosophical analysis but genuine structural tension in housing contexts where scarcity and agglomeration concentrate opportunity in specific locations that cannot accommodate all legitimate claimants.

Third, housing's dual role under financialization creates a structural contradiction that may exceed contractualist resolution. Fikse and Aalbers (2020) identify "the really big contradiction": financialized homeownership systematically undermines its own ideological foundations because housing appreciation as wealth store destroys affordability. Ryan-Collins (2019, 2021) traces the housing-finance feedback cycle where pro-homeownership policy combined with credit liberalization makes price appreciation structurally necessary, yet this very appreciation prevents newcomers from accessing housing. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics rather than income or homeownership rates, creating intergenerational unfairness as parental housing wealth increasingly determines offspring's housing outcomes. Property-owning democracy, Rawls's preferred institutional framework, faces severe difficulties when applied to housing: dispersed homeownership enables wealth accumulation via appreciation (benefiting owners, excluding newcomers), yet suppressing appreciation attacks incumbent security (Gregory 2016; Erck 2024). Freeman's (2013, 2018) emphasis on democratic reciprocity and self-respect as central to property-owning democracy intensifies the problem—neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies reciprocity requirements because each enriches or protects some while undermining others' legitimate interests. This may reveal principled limits to contractualist justification: when institutional arrangements must serve contradictory functions (affordable necessity and wealth store), no policy can satisfy reasonable acceptance standards for all affected parties.

Fourth, planning's irreversibility under epistemic uncertainty about future preferences generates obligations that standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize. Urban planning decisions create path dependencies binding future generations (McCauley et al. 2018), yet we cannot know future preferences regarding urban form, housing arrangements, or the relative value of density, mobility, and public space. Standard intergenerational justice theories struggle: relational egalitarian approaches face the intergenerational justice dilemma because future generations lack social relations in the relevant sense (Bengtson 2025; Lippert-Rasmussen 2025), while optimization-based approaches require contested assumptions about future values that cannot be justified (Green and Brandstedt 2020). Epistemic justice frameworks provide alternative resources: we may owe future generations epistemic capacity-preservation—maintaining interpretive frameworks and option-sets supporting autonomous interpretation—rather than optimized outcomes based on present assumptions (Fricker 2007, 2013; Medina 2013). Planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations by constraining their capacity to interpret and contest inherited spatial arrangements (Halsband 2022; Byskov and Hyams 2023). Option-preservation approaches under irreversibility (Zwarthoed 2016; Doorn 2025) offer alternatives to optimization, but contractualist frameworks have not adequately integrated epistemic duties that do not require reciprocity or social relations.

These four failings are interconnected. Fungibility assumptions affect how we conceptualize trade-offs between occupancy and access: if location were genuinely fungible, occupancy protection could be compensated through resources enabling relocation, resolving the deadlock. The dual-role problem intensifies both occupancy and access tensions: financialization makes incumbent homeowners dependent on appreciation (strengthening occupancy claims) while excluding newcomers from wealth accumulation (intensifying access claims). Intergenerational epistemic duties constrain planning authority in ways that affect all three synchronic problems: we cannot optimize away the dual-role contradiction on behalf of future generations whose values we cannot know, nor can we foreclose options for future occupancy or access by locking in irreversible spatial patterns.

The housing justice research surveyed here employs primarily human rights, capabilities, and relational egalitarian frameworks (Halliday and Meyer 2024). Wells (2019) defends housing rights grounded in autonomy; Shue's (2020) basic rights framework establishes housing as necessary for enjoying all other rights; Kimhur (2024) and Dummer and Neuhäuser (2025) develop capabilities approaches emphasizing functionings, securities, and self-respect; Cass (2023, 2024) shows how relational equality has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions requiring relatively equal housing access for civic status. These frameworks offer important resources contractualism must engage. Yet Halliday and Meyer identify a gap: the field lacks normative approaches beyond flourishing and relational equality that can address macroeconomic dimensions including housing price dynamics and wealth accumulation through homeownership. This gap suggests space for contractualist contributions.

What would contractualist resources for housing justice require? First, conceptual tools for non-fungible goods where value is constitutively location-dependent. Kymlicka's (1989, 1995) precedent treating cultural membership as a primary good despite context-dependence suggests contractualism can accommodate non-fungible goods, but this requires extending primary goods frameworks or developing alternative metrics that respect irreducible location-specificity. Second, principles for adjudicating between competing legitimate claims when full satisfaction of both is impossible. The occupancy/access deadlock may require acknowledging tragic choices where contractualism reaches justificatory limits, or developing priority rules that themselves can survive reasonable rejection scrutiny. Third, frameworks for institutional evaluation when structures serve contradictory purposes. The dual-role problem suggests contractualism must either show how some institutional design resolves the contradiction (perhaps through robust social housing provision or fundamental finance system reform), or explain what justice requires when no arrangement satisfies all affected parties' reasonable acceptance. Fourth, integration of epistemic duties to future generations that extend obligations beyond reciprocity-based or relation-based frameworks. Chan's (2025) capacity-preservation argument for relational equality provides a model: we owe future generations the capacity to relate (or interpret, or choose) as equals, even absent direct relations with them.

The research project this review supports does not aim to solve housing injustice comprehensively. Rather, it seeks clearer analysis of where contractualist justification reaches its limits and what normative resources are needed to address housing's distinctive features. The four failings established here—fungibility, occupancy/access deadlock, dual-role contradiction, and epistemic duties under irreversibility—constitute systematic rather than contingent problems. They reveal that housing requires distinctive theoretical treatment beyond applying general distributive principles to a particular good. Whether contractualism can be extended to handle these challenges, or whether they mark principled boundaries of contractualist application, remains to be determined. But establishing that these challenges exist, that they are systematic, and that they reflect deep features of housing rather than theoretical oversights, advances understanding of both housing justice and contractualism's scope and limits.
