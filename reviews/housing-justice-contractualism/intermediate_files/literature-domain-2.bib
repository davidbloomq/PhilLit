====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how theories of distributive justice handle goods whose value is constitutively tied to location, context, or social meaning, challenging the fungibility assumption implicit in dominant frameworks. The fungibility assumption treats all goods as substitutable via a common metric (welfare, resources, capabilities), yet certain goods—particularly housing in specific locations—resist such commensuration.

Brighouse and Swift (2006) established that positional goods (whose value depends on relative standing) create convergence among egalitarian, prioritarian, and sufficientarian principles, suggesting that goods with inherent relational or positional features require distinct treatment. This insight extends to location-specific goods where value is constituted, not merely affected, by location. Walzer (1983) and Miller (1999) developed pluralist theories recognizing distinct spheres or contexts where different distributive principles apply, challenging monistic approaches. Anderson (1999) critiqued luck egalitarianism's focus on distributing neutral resources, arguing for democratic equality emphasizing capabilities and social relations.

The capabilities approach (Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2011) highlights conversion factors—personal, social, and environmental conditions that determine whether resources translate into capabilities. Location emerges as a critical conversion factor, but the literature has not fully theorized goods where location constitutes (rather than merely converts) value. Kymlicka (1989, 1995) argues cultural membership functions as a primary good, establishing precedent for non-fungible, context-dependent goods within liberal frameworks.

Recent work by Cass (2023) refines the positional goods debate, while Freiman (2014) explores tensions between priority and position. Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (2015) develops spatial justice theory, though philosophical integration with distributive justice remains underdeveloped.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the fungibility assumption central to the research project. If housing value is location-specific in a constitutive (not merely convertible) sense, then standard Rawlsian approaches premised on fungible primary goods may inadequately handle housing justice. The positional goods literature provides analytical tools for goods whose value depends on relational features, while capabilities approaches offer frameworks for context-dependent valuation. This literature establishes theoretical space for non-fungible goods within liberal justice without abandoning contractualism.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature addresses positional goods (relative ranking) and special goods (cultural, relational) but rarely examines location-specific value as a distinct category. Spatial justice theory remains disconnected from analytic distributive justice debates. Few papers explicitly challenge the fungibility assumption in Rawls or Dworkin, and none systematically explore housing as a non-fungible good.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish: (1) positional value (comparative), (2) contextual value (conversion-dependent), and (3) constitutive location-specific value. It should examine whether the fungibility assumption is explicit or implicit in primary goods/equality of resources frameworks, and whether capabilities approaches successfully escape it. The convergence thesis for positional goods (Brighouse & Swift, Cass) may extend to location-specific goods, suggesting that housing justice transcends standard egalitarian divisions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Monistic resource-based: 8 papers - Standard Rawlsian/Dworkinian approaches assuming fungible goods
- Pluralist/contextual: 6 papers - Walzer, Miller, capabilities approaches recognizing context-dependence
- Positional/relational: 4 papers - Brighouse & Swift, Cass, Freiman on goods whose value is inherently relational

  CORE ARGUMENT: Positional goods—goods whose value depends on one's relative standing—generate convergence among typically competing distributive principles (egalitarianism, prioritarianism, sufficientarianism). When goods have positional aspects, equalizing distribution becomes instrumentally valuable even for non-egalitarians, since relative deprivation matters for welfare independent of absolute levels. The authors develop a taxonomy distinguishing goods that are positional in their nature (like status), in their value (like educational credentials), or in their effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes the theoretical framework for analyzing goods whose value is not purely absolute but depends on relational or contextual features. Location-specific housing value parallels positional goods: the value of living in a particular location partly depends on what others cannot access (exclusivity, proximity to opportunities). If housing is positional in Brighouse and Swift's sense, standard distributive principles may converge on more equal distribution than typically thought. The paper's distinction between nature, value, and effects provides analytical tools for characterizing location-specific value.

  POSITION: Pluralist/relational approach showing that goods with inherent relational features require distinct normative treatment, potentially bridging standard egalitarian divides.

  pages = {283--345},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315199795-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dworkin develops equality of resources as an alternative to welfare egalitarianism, using the hypothetical auction and insurance markets to determine fair distributions that are both endowment-insensitive and ambition-sensitive. Resources are distributed equally when no one prefers another's bundle to their own (envy test). The framework treats resources as fungible—tradeable and substitutable—allowing individuals to convert holdings into preferred bundles through market mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: Dworkin's equality of resources explicitly assumes fungibility: all resources can be compared, traded, and substituted via the auction mechanism. This makes his framework particularly revealing for examining the fungibility assumption. Location-specific goods that resist substitution (because value is constituted by location, not convertible) challenge the envy test and auction framework. If housing in location A provides irreplaceable value, then no other bundle may satisfy the envy test even if formally equivalent in resource terms. Dworkin's framework exposes how deeply fungibility assumptions structure resourcist approaches to justice.

  POSITION: Foundational resourcist approach explicitly premised on fungibility of goods via market mechanisms.

  volume = {109},
  number = {2},
  pages = {287--337},
  doi = {10.1086/233897},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson critiques luck egalitarianism's focus on equalizing resources or welfare to compensate for brute luck, arguing it leads to objectionable conclusions (abandoning the imprudent, pitying the naturally disadvantaged) and misconceives equality's point. Democratic equality, by contrast, aims to ensure all citizens can function as equals in democratic society. Justice requires guaranteeing capabilities for democratic participation, not equalizing holdings or welfare. Democratic equality is capability-focused but relational: what matters is whether people can relate as equals, not metric equivalence of goods.

  RELEVANCE: Anderson's critique challenges the fungibility assumption from a different angle: if justice is about relational equality and capabilities for democratic functioning, not metric resource equivalence, then location-specific goods matter insofar as they enable or undermine equal standing. Housing in particular locations may be essential for democratic equality (access to employment, political participation, public goods) in ways that cannot be compensated through fungible resource redistribution. Her critique of the resourcist focus on "neutral resources" supports examining goods whose value is constituted by social and spatial context.

  POSITION: Capability and relational approach rejecting resourcist fungibility assumptions in favor of functionings and social relations.

@book{sen1985commodities,
  author = {Sen, Amartya},
  title = {Commodities and Capabilities},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1985},
  doi = {10.2307/135247},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sen argues that evaluating well-being and justice requires focusing on capabilities (what people can do and be) rather than commodities (resources) or utilities (welfare). The same commodity bundle provides different capabilities depending on personal, social, and environmental conversion factors. A person's functioning depends not just on what resources they possess but on how effectively they can convert resources into valuable capabilities. This makes interpersonal comparisons based on resource holdings or utility inadequate.

  RELEVANCE: Sen's emphasis on conversion factors directly addresses context-dependence in how goods generate value. Location functions as a critical environmental conversion factor: the same housing unit provides radically different capabilities depending on location (access to employment, education, social networks, political participation). However, Sen's framework treats location as affecting conversion of resources into capabilities, not as constituting the good itself. The question remains whether location-specific value is merely a conversion factor issue or represents a deeper challenge to resource metrics. Sen's work provides tools for context-dependent valuation while potentially preserving a form of fungibility (capabilities as common metric).

  POSITION: Capability approach emphasizing conversion factors and context-dependence, offering alternative to resource metrics while potentially preserving capability-based commensurability.

@book{nussbaum2011creating,

  title = {Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {2011},
  doi = {10.5860/choice.49-0784},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Nussbaum develops Sen's capabilities approach into a more determinate theory by specifying a list of central human capabilities that governments should secure for all citizens as a matter of justice. The list includes life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses/imagination/thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one's environment. Unlike Sen's deliberately open-ended approach, Nussbaum argues political liberalism requires threshold levels of specific capabilities. Capabilities are diverse and irreducible to a single metric.

  RELEVANCE: Nussbaum's rejection of metric equivalence across capabilities challenges fungibility assumptions more directly than Sen. If capabilities are incommensurable and each requires threshold protection, then goods essential for specific capabilities cannot be freely substituted. Housing location affects multiple Nussbaumian capabilities: affiliation (access to social networks, community), practical reason (access to employment, educational opportunities), control over environment (political participation, access to public goods). If location-constituted capabilities are irreducible, then housing in particular locations may not be fungible with other goods. Nussbaum's framework provides theoretical space for non-fungible goods while maintaining liberal commitments.

  POSITION: Specified capability approach emphasizing capability diversity and thresholds, resisting single-metric commensurability.

@book{walzer1983spheres,
  author = {Walzer, Michael},
  title = {Spheres of Justice: A Defense of Pluralism and Equality},
  publisher = {Basic Books},
  address = {New York},
  year = {1983},
  doi = {10.2307/2026330},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Walzer develops a pluralist theory where justice requires distributing different goods according to their distinct social meanings, not a single principle across all spheres. Different spheres (membership, security, welfare, money, education, political power, etc.) have internal logics determining appropriate distributive principles. Injustice occurs through "tyranny"—when success in one sphere (e.g., wealth) illegitimately converts to dominance in another (e.g., political power). Complex equality prevents domination by blocking conversions while allowing inequality within spheres.

  RELEVANCE: Walzer's pluralism directly challenges monistic approaches assuming fungible goods distributed by universal principles. Housing and location might constitute distinct spheres with internal distributive logic resistant to monetary conversion. If living in particular locations is a distinct good with social meaning (community membership, access to opportunities, political participation), then its distribution should follow principles appropriate to that sphere, not pure market allocation or generalized resource equality. Walzer's anti-conversion principle particularly resonates: wealth should not automatically convert to exclusive spatial access. However, his conventionalism (social meanings determine justice) may conflict with critical evaluation of existing spatial inequalities.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach treating different goods as belonging to distinct spheres with sphere-specific distributive principles, resisting cross-sphere fungibility.

@book{miller1999principles,

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1999},
  doi = {10.4159/9780674266117},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller defends contextual pluralism: different principles of justice (desert, need, equality) apply in different contexts of human association. Solidaristic communities distribute by need, instrumental associations by desert, citizenship by equality. Unlike Walzer's social-meaning pluralism, Miller grounds contextual principles in the nature of relationships rather than existing conventions, allowing critical distance from status quo distributions. The principles are plural but not arbitrary—they derive from the conditions that make different forms of association possible and valuable.

  RELEVANCE: Miller's contextual approach provides a framework for examining whether location-specific goods require distinct distributive principles based on the form of association location enables. If housing in particular locations constitutes membership in local communities (solidaristic), provides access to employment (instrumental), or enables political participation (citizenship), different principles might apply depending on which relational context dominates. Miller's critical pluralism avoids Walzer's conservatism while rejecting monistic fungibility assumptions. His work supports treating housing/location as potentially subject to need-based or equality-based principles in civic contexts, even if market desert principles govern other goods.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach grounding different distributive principles in distinct forms of social relations, offering critical distance from conventions while resisting monism.

  volume = {29},
  number = {3},
  pages = {501--520},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-023-09581-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass examines and refines the "convergence thesis" (from Brighouse and Swift 2006) that egalitarians, prioritarians, and sufficientarians converge on favoring equal distribution of positional goods. She shows the thesis faces problems when applied to education and wealth, but succeeds for civic status—the central concern of relational or "social" egalitarianism. Relational equality requires equal civic status, which is inherently positional: one's standing as a citizen partly depends on how one ranks relative to others. Thus even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality must favor relatively equal distributions of goods affecting civic status.

  RELEVANCE: Cass's refined convergence thesis has direct implications for housing and location. If access to particular locations affects civic status (enabling political participation, access to public institutions, community membership), then even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality should favor less unequal spatial distributions than market outcomes typically produce. Housing location is plausibly positional in Cass's sense: extreme residential segregation by income creates civic status hierarchies incompatible with relational equality. This suggests housing/location justice may transcend standard egalitarian/prioritarian divisions, providing grounds for state intervention in housing markets that appeal across distributive frameworks.

  POSITION: Refined relational egalitarian approach showing positional aspects of civic status generate convergence on relatively equal distribution, with implications for goods affecting social standing.

@article{freiman2014priority,
  author = {Freiman, Christopher},
  title = {Priority and Position},
  journal = {Philosophical Studies},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {167},
  number = {2},
  pages = {341--360},
  doi = {10.1007/S11098-013-0099-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Freiman argues that prioritarianism—the view that benefiting people matters more the worse off they are—faces difficulties handling positional goods. Prioritarianism focuses on absolute welfare levels, but positional goods' value depends on relative standing. When goods are positional, increasing everyone's absolute level may not improve anyone's situation (if relative positions unchanged), yet prioritarianism would count this as an improvement. Conversely, equalizing positional goods by leveling down (reducing everyone's position equally) might improve relative standing despite reducing absolute welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Freiman's critique exposes tensions between priority-based approaches and goods with inherent relational value. If housing location is positional (value depending on relative access, exclusivity, or status), then prioritarian arguments for improving the absolute housing situations of the worst-off may miss the relational dimension. Simply building more housing in currently underserved areas doesn't address positional value if relative hierarchy persists. This suggests location-specific goods may require explicitly egalitarian (not just prioritarian) treatment, or recognition that positional aspects generate distinct normative considerations irreducible to absolute welfare levels.

  POSITION: Critical examination of prioritarianism's difficulty handling positional goods, suggesting relational features may require distinct normative principles.

@book{kymlicka1989liberalism,
  author = {Kymlicka, Will},
  title = {Liberalism, Community, and Culture},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1989},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka argues that cultural membership should be recognized as a primary good in the Rawlsian sense—something every rational person has reason to want regardless of their particular conception of the good. Cultural membership provides the context of choice within which individuals form and pursue life plans. Without access to a rich cultural structure, individual autonomy is severely compromised. Therefore, liberal justice requires protecting minority cultures through group-differentiated rights, contrary to traditional liberal neutrality.

  RELEVANCE: Kymlicka establishes precedent within liberal frameworks for goods that are context-dependent and not straightforwardly fungible. Cultural membership cannot be compensated through generic resources because it provides irreplaceable context for choice and identity. This parallels the argument that location provides irreplaceable context: particular locations constitute access to communities, employment networks, public institutions, and social capital that cannot be replicated elsewhere. If Rawlsian frameworks can accommodate cultural membership as a special good, they potentially can accommodate location-specific goods. Kymlicka's argument provides a model for expanding primary goods beyond fungible resources without abandoning contractualism.

@book{kymlicka1995multicultural,
  author = {Kymlicka, Will},
  title = {Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1995},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka extends his earlier work on cultural membership to develop a comprehensive liberal theory of minority rights, distinguishing between national minorities (distinct cultural communities) and ethnic groups (immigrants). He argues for group-differentiated citizenship rights including self-government rights for national minorities, polyethnic rights for ethnic groups, and special representation rights. Cultural structure is an essential primary good that provides the context within which individuals make meaningful choices about how to lead their lives.

  RELEVANCE: Kymlicka's mature theory further develops how liberal frameworks can accommodate goods that are context-dependent, collective, and not fungible with generic resources. The parallel to location is strong: just as cultural communities are territorially situated and provide irreplaceable context for meaningful choice, particular locations provide irreplaceable access to opportunities, communities, and ways of life. Kymlicka's framework suggests justice requires not just resource redistribution but securing access to context-providing goods. This has implications for housing justice: if particular locations function analogously to cultural structures in providing essential context, then justice may require ensuring access rather than merely compensating through fungible resources.

  POSITION: Refined liberal multiculturalist approach developing group-differentiated rights based on cultural membership as essential context for autonomy, extending primary goods beyond fungible resources.

@book{rawls1971theory,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {A Theory of Justice},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1971},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls develops justice as fairness, arguing principles of justice would be chosen by rational agents behind a veil of ignorance. The principles include equal basic liberties and the difference principle (inequalities permitted only if they benefit the least advantaged). Primary social goods—things every rational person wants regardless of their life plan (rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, self-respect)—provide the metric for distributive justice. The focus on primary goods rather than welfare allows public, objective comparisons while respecting plurality of conceptions of the good.

  RELEVANCE: Rawls's primary goods approach implicitly treats goods as fungible in two senses: (1) they can be measured and compared via an index, and (2) inequalities in one good can be justified by benefits in another (via the difference principle). The question is whether housing in particular locations fits the primary goods framework or resists it. Location might affect multiple primary goods (opportunities, income, perhaps self-respect), but if location-specific value is irreducible to these metrics, the framework faces challenges. Examining Rawls closely reveals whether fungibility is explicit or implicit, and whether the framework has resources to handle non-fungible goods.

  POSITION: Foundational contractualist approach using primary goods as metric, potentially assuming fungibility and metric comparability across goods.

@article{rawls2001justice,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {Justice as Fairness: A Restatement},
  journal = {Philosophy and Public Affairs},
  year = {2001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls reformulates and clarifies justice as fairness, addressing criticisms and developing the political conception more fully. He refines the list of primary goods, emphasizing their role as an index of citizens' expectations regarding distribution of basic rights and socio-economic benefits. Primary goods are all-purpose means useful for realizing a wide range of conceptions of the good. The index weights basic liberties most heavily, followed by opportunities, then income and wealth. Rawls clarifies that primary goods are what free and equal citizens need qua citizens.

  RELEVANCE: The restatement provides Rawls's mature view on primary goods, making explicit features that were implicit in the original theory. The "all-purpose means" characterization reinforces fungibility: primary goods are valuable precisely because they're instrumentally useful across diverse life plans, not for constitutive value tied to particular contexts. This makes the framework particularly revealing for location-specific goods: if housing location has non-instrumental, context-specific value, it may not fit the all-purpose means model. However, Rawls's emphasis on what citizens "need qua citizens" might provide opening for location-based civic participation arguments.

  POSITION: Refined contractualist position clarifying primary goods as all-purpose means, making fungibility assumption more explicit while potentially accommodating citizen-need arguments.

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  year = {2010},
  editor = {Brighouse, Harry and Robeyns, Ingrid},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume systematically compares primary goods and capabilities approaches to measuring justice. Contributors debate whether Rawlsian primary goods or Sen/Nussbaum capabilities better serve as the metric for distributive justice. Key debates include: Do capabilities' emphasis on conversion factors handle diversity better? Do primary goods provide more workable public metrics? Can the approaches be reconciled or are they fundamentally opposed? Essays by Anderson, Arneson, Pogge, and others map the terrain.

  RELEVANCE: The volume provides comprehensive treatment of the central debate for this research: what metric should guide distributive justice, and can either approach handle goods whose value is context-dependent or location-specific? The conversion factors debate is particularly relevant: capabilities theorists argue primary goods fail to account for how personal and social circumstances affect what people can do with resources. Location functions as a key conversion factor, but the question remains whether this exhausts location's normative significance or whether location-constituted value poses deeper problems for both approaches.

  POSITION: Comparative examination of primary goods vs. capabilities metrics, mapping how each approach handles context-dependence and conversion factors.

  title = {Spatial Justice: Body, Lawscape, Atmosphere},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos develops spatial justice theory examining how law, space, and bodies mutually constitute each other. Space is not a neutral container for social relations but actively produces and is produced by legal, social, and material practices. Spatial justice requires attending to how laws create atmospheric conditions that enable or constrain embodied existence in particular locations. The lawscape concept captures how legal norms are spatially materialized and how spatial arrangements embody legal relations.

  RELEVANCE: This work develops spatial justice as a distinct theoretical framework, though it remains largely disconnected from analytic distributive justice debates. The emphasis on space's constitutive role (not merely as location for pre-existing activities) parallels the argument that location-specific value is constituted by rather than merely converted through location. However, the continental theoretical approach, emphasis on affect and atmosphere, and resistance to principles-based frameworks make direct integration with contractualist justice difficult. The work establishes that spatial justice is an active research area but highlights the disconnect between geographic/continental and analytic/distributive approaches.

  pages = {291--309},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X09105390},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller examines how political boundaries affect justice, arguing that special obligations to co-nationals are compatible with cosmopolitan duties. The scope and content of justice principles vary depending on whether people share citizenship, economic cooperation, or mere humanity. Co-nationals share thicker obligations grounded in political community, while the global scope encompasses thinner humanitarian duties. Physical proximity and territorial boundaries matter normatively because they structure different forms of association.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on international justice, Miller's argument that boundaries and territories structure different normative obligations has implications for domestic spatial justice. If different locales constitute different forms of association (neighborhoods, municipalities, regions), this might ground location-specific obligations and claims. The argument that physical proximity and territorial arrangements aren't merely empirical facts but normatively significant connects to debates about whether location-specific value warrants distinct treatment. However, Miller doesn't develop implications for housing or domestic spatial distribution.

  POSITION: Applies contextual pluralism to territorial boundaries, arguing boundaries normatively structure different forms of association and corresponding principles.

  journal = {Economics and Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1017/s0266267125100424},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Tyssedal argues that the philosophical literature has misinterpreted Fred Hirsch's original concept of positional goods. Hirsch defined positional goods as scarce goods that are fixed or near-fixed in supply, not (as Brighouse and Swift interpret) goods whose value depends on relative ranking. This distinction matters: Hirsch's concept has different explanatory power for understanding economic growth limits and social conflicts. The supply-based definition is more basic and useful than the ranking-based definition dominant in philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This conceptual clarification matters for analyzing housing and location. On Hirsch's original definition, location in desirable areas is positional because spatial supply is fixed: there's only so much beachfront property, proximity to city centers, or access to elite school districts. No amount of economic growth increases supply of these locations, unlike manufactured goods. On Brighouse/Swift's ranking definition, location is positional only if value depends on relative standing. The supply-based definition more directly captures why location-specific goods resist fungibility: you cannot produce more of them, regardless of resource availability. This supports treating location-specific goods as special cases requiring distinct distributive treatment.

  POSITION: Conceptual analysis recovering supply-based definition of positional goods, with implications for goods with fixed spatial supply.

  number = {1},
  pages = {51--71},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X241251389},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass argues that relational or "social" equality is distinct from distributive equality and has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions. Relational equality concerns equal civic status—the absence of hierarchical social relations—rather than metric equality of goods. Civic status is inherently positional (depends on relative standing) and diachronic (unfolds over time). This makes relational equality conceptually independent from distributive principles while having implications for distribution: maintaining equal civic status constrains permissible distributive inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Cass's argument that relational equality has distinctive positional dimensions directly applies to housing and spatial justice. Extreme residential segregation by income, race, or class creates hierarchical civic status incompatible with relational equality even if absolute standards are met. The temporal dimension matters too: cumulative residential segregation across generations compounds status hierarchies. If housing location affects civic status (access to political participation, public goods, community membership), then relational equality requires constraining spatial inequalities beyond what distributive principles alone might demand. This provides independent grounds for state intervention in housing markets rooted in relational rather than purely distributive concerns.

  POSITION: Relational egalitarian approach distinguishing civic status equality from distributive equality while showing status concerns constrain permissible distributions, with spatial implications.
