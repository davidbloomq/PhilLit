DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes the economic foundations for understanding why location matters
in housing justice debates. Urban economics demonstrates that agglomeration externalities—
knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, and shared infrastructure—create non-exportable
locational value that is geographically concentrated. The seminal work of Duranton & Puga
(2004) provides the micro-foundations for three types of agglomeration mechanisms: sharing
(reducing costs through pooled resources), matching (improving match quality in thick labor
markets), and learning (facilitating knowledge spillovers). This foundational framework
explains why high-productivity cities generate wage premia that cannot be replicated elsewhere.

The contemporary empirical literature, particularly Hsieh & Moretti (2019), demonstrates
that housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities create massive aggregate costs—
lowering US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009—by preventing workers from accessing
locations with high agglomeration externalities. Ganong & Shoag (2017) show that rising
housing prices in high-income places have fundamentally altered migration patterns, ending
historic income convergence across US regions and redirecting low-skill migration away from
opportunity-rich locations. Recent work documents how housing constraints create spatial
misallocation of labor, with workers unable to move to locations where their productivity
would be highest.

This literature is essential for understanding the "privatization of agglomeration rents"
critique: when housing supply is constrained in high-productivity locations, landowners
capture value created by collective agglomeration externalities, while workers face
higher costs to access these productivity gains. The empirical evidence shows housing
constraints don't merely redistribute value—they destroy aggregate productivity by
preventing efficient spatial allocation of labor.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly grounds the housing justice project's analysis of locational value,
fungibility, and access/occupancy trade-offs. Agglomeration economics demonstrates that
location generates non-exportable value through mechanisms (knowledge spillovers, network
effects, thick labor markets) that cannot be replicated in other places, challenging
any simplistic fungibility assumption. The spatial misallocation literature quantifies
the aggregate costs when housing constraints prevent workers from accessing high-productivity
locations, providing empirical support for why housing access in specific locations matters
for both efficiency and equity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The urban economics literature focuses primarily on aggregate productivity and efficiency
costs, with less attention to distributional justice questions or normative frameworks
for evaluating who should benefit from locational value. Most papers treat housing
constraints as inefficiencies to be corrected rather than examining potential justice-based
reasons for limiting access or distributing locational benefits. The connection between
agglomeration theory and housing justice remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, emphasize how agglomeration mechanisms create genuinely
non-fungible locational value, making housing access in specific places non-substitutable.
Connect spatial misallocation findings to contractualist concerns about fair terms of
social cooperation: constraints that prevent efficient sorting may violate both reasonable
acceptance (by limiting opportunity access) and reciprocity (by allowing rent extraction
without productivity contribution). The empirical magnitude of aggregate costs (36% GDP
growth loss) strengthens arguments that housing constraints in high-productivity areas
impose unreasonable burdens on excluded workers.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using a spatial equilibrium model with data from 220 US metropolitan areas, this paper quantifies the aggregate economic cost of housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities. The authors find that stringent housing restrictions in cities like New York and San Francisco effectively limit worker access to high-productivity locations, creating spatial misallocation of labor that lowered aggregate US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009. The mechanism operates through housing supply constraints preventing workers from moving to cities where their productivity would be highest, despite equilibrium wage differentials that should attract migration.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the central empirical foundation for understanding how housing constraints in high-productivity locations generate massive aggregate costs, not merely redistributive effects. The 36% GDP growth loss quantifies the economic magnitude of preventing access to productive locations, directly supporting arguments that housing constraints impose unreasonable burdens on excluded workers. The spatial misallocation framework demonstrates why location-specific housing access matters—agglomeration externalities create productivity gains that cannot be captured elsewhere, making fungibility arguments fail empirically. This grounds the project's analysis of occupancy/access trade-offs: constraints that benefit current residents by limiting supply impose enormous aggregate costs by preventing efficient spatial sorting.

  doi = {10.1016/j.jue.2017.07.002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper documents a dramatic decline in regional income convergence across US states over the past 30 years, coinciding with disproportionate housing price increases in high-income places. Using a new panel measure of housing supply regulations, the authors demonstrate that rising housing prices in high-income areas deter low-skill migration and slow income convergence. Before 1980, low-income workers migrated to high-income places and experienced income gains; after 1980, housing costs made such migration unprofitable for low-skill workers, who redirected to lower-income locations. The divergence in skill-specific returns to moving to high-income places fundamentally altered US spatial equilibrium.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates how housing constraints transform spatial sorting patterns with profound distributional consequences. Historically, migration to high-income places offered opportunity for low-skill workers; housing price increases have effectively closed this channel, redirecting low-skill migration away from opportunity-rich locations. This directly connects to contractualist concerns about fair opportunity access: housing constraints create spatial segregation by skill level, concentrating low-skill workers in low-productivity areas not by choice but by housing cost barriers. The end of regional income convergence suggests housing constraints violate reasonable acceptance by systematically disadvantaging those who would most benefit from access to high-productivity locations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive handbook chapter provides the theoretical micro-foundations for agglomeration economies, organizing mechanisms into three categories: sharing (indivisible facilities, gains from variety in inputs/outputs, risk-pooling), matching (reducing search/matching frictions, improving match quality in thick markets), and learning (knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face interaction). The authors demonstrate how these mechanisms operate at the level of individual interactions to generate city-level productivity advantages. They distinguish localization economies (same-industry clustering) from urbanization economies (city-size effects) and evaluate empirical evidence for each mechanism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for why location generates non-exportable value, directly addressing fungibility arguments in housing justice debates. The sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms explain why productivity gains from agglomeration cannot be replicated by simply moving to a different location—they depend on the thick markets, specialized infrastructure, and knowledge networks present only in high-density, economically concentrated areas. Knowledge spillovers through face-to-face interaction particularly resist virtualization or geographic substitution. This theoretical framework grounds the project's argument that housing access in specific high-productivity locations is genuinely non-fungible: the value generated by agglomeration externalities is location-specific and non-exportable.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This meta-analysis synthesizes empirical evidence on agglomeration externalities from hundreds of studies, finding that urbanization economies (city-size effects) dominate localization economies (industry-specific clustering) in explaining productivity gains. The authors document substantial variation in effect sizes across contexts but confirm robust positive productivity effects from urban density. They identify knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as the most important mechanisms, with effects strongest in knowledge-intensive industries. The paper also examines congestion costs and finds that productivity benefits typically outweigh negative externalities until very high density levels.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive evidence synthesis validates the empirical significance of agglomeration externalities for productivity, supporting arguments that location-specific value is substantial and economically meaningful. The finding that urbanization economies dominate suggests that city-level access matters, not merely access to specific industries—strengthening arguments for broad housing access to high-productivity cities. The identification of knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as key mechanisms connects to the project's fungibility analysis: these benefits depend on physical proximity and thick markets that cannot be replicated remotely. The balance between agglomeration benefits and congestion costs informs optimal density arguments relevant to housing policy debates.

  pages = {53--80},
  doi = {10.1257/jep.37.2.53},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper documents how housing supply constraints have increasingly shaped US urban development patterns over the past four decades. The author shows that regulatory restrictions and physical constraints (topography, existing development density) have made housing supply increasingly inelastic, particularly in larger and denser metropolitan areas. As a result, demand growth manifests as price increases rather than population/housing quantity increases. This has pushed new construction to urban fringes and driven rapid price appreciation in supply-constrained core areas. The declining responsiveness of housing supply to demand has contributed to both housing affordability crises and inefficient spatial patterns of development.

  RELEVANCE: This paper synthesizes evidence on how housing supply constraints operate and intensify over time, providing institutional context for the spatial misallocation literature. The finding that constraints strengthen with density and city size explains why the most productive locations face the most severe supply restrictions, exacerbating spatial misallocation costs. The paper connects to contractualist analysis by documenting how regulatory barriers—not merely market forces or physical constraints—drive supply inelasticity, raising questions about whether these policy choices can be reasonably accepted by those excluded. The shift toward fringe development rather than core densification illustrates trade-offs between occupancy protection and access expansion.

  pages = {66--104},
  doi = {10.1080/00779954.2020.1791939},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using New Zealand data, this paper identifies large and increasing "wedges" between house prices and underlying construction costs, attributing these to the collision of rising demand with housing supply constraints including zoning restrictions. The author shows that regions with larger initial price distortions experienced larger price increases in response to migration shocks, creating economic costs through labor misallocation. A calibrated spatial equilibrium model estimates that comprehensively removing housing supply constraints would have increased New Zealand's GDP by up to 8.4%, with more modest constraint relaxation producing gains of 1-5% of GDP. The paper also documents that constraints contributed to net migration outflows to Australia.

  RELEVANCE: This international evidence demonstrates that spatial misallocation costs from housing constraints are not unique to the US, strengthening the generalizability of Hsieh & Moretti's findings. The identification of large and growing price-cost wedges provides a direct measure of how constraints create economic distortions. The finding that supply-constrained regions experience amplified price responses to demand shocks illustrates how constraints transform demand growth into exclusion rather than accommodation. For housing justice debates, this paper quantifies aggregate costs (up to 8.4% GDP) from supply constraints, raising serious questions about whether such policies can be reasonably accepted when they impose such large burdens on both excluded workers and national productivity.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using matched employer-employee data for the entire Swedish economy (1990-2008), this paper examines how social networks influence productivity in regional agglomerations. The authors construct plant-level co-worker networks and find that increasing network density positively affects productivity, particularly in large, specialized regional industry clusters. Triadic closure (redundant ties) shows negative effects, suggesting non-redundant knowledge access matters most. The paper finds limited support for the intrinsic value of diversity; instead, specialization conditions the benefits of both related-industry linkages and non-local ties.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides micro-level evidence on the mechanisms through which agglomeration externalities operate—specifically, through social networks that facilitate knowledge spillovers and learning. The finding that dense but non-redundant networks drive productivity gains demonstrates why physical proximity in thick labor markets matters: face-to-face interaction builds the network ties that generate agglomeration benefits. This mechanism is inherently non-exportable and location-specific, supporting arguments against housing fungibility. For contractualism, this evidence suggests that access to productive locations provides network benefits that cannot be replicated through remote work or relocation to lower-density areas, strengthening claims that exclusion from high-productivity areas imposes real opportunity costs.

  volume = {65},
  number = {4},
  pages = {1845--1880},
  doi = {10.1111/iere.12724},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using an equilibrium sorting model with Chinese microdata, this paper evaluates the welfare and distributional consequences of dual constraints on mobility (institutional restrictions via hukou system) and housing supply. Counterfactual simulations show that lowering migration costs would increase welfare and reduce inequality by enabling workers to move from inland to coastal regions, but these gains depend critically on housing supply elasticity in receiving regions. The authors demonstrate policy complementarities: the welfare gains from reducing mobility constraints are larger when housing supply is elastic, and vice versa. When both constraints bind simultaneously, they compound each other's negative effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends spatial misallocation analysis to contexts with explicit mobility restrictions, demonstrating how housing supply constraints interact with other barriers to efficient sorting. The finding of policy complementarities is crucial for housing justice debates: even if housing supply were expanded in high-productivity cities, other institutional barriers (in China's case, hukou; in US contexts, potentially exclusionary zoning or discrimination) may prevent efficient sorting. This suggests that addressing housing justice requires coordinated attention to both supply constraints and access barriers. The distributional analysis shows that dual constraints particularly harm low-skill workers who would benefit most from migration to productive locations, connecting to contractualist concerns about reasonable acceptance.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper analyzes how spatial agglomeration externalities affect Italian start-up firm survival, finding that industry variety (especially related variety) reduces firm exit probability. Related variety, which facilitates knowledge generation and diffusion across complementary industries, positively affects manufacturing firm survival, while unrelated variety benefits service sectors through portfolio diversification effects. Localization economies (same-industry concentration) benefit only service sector firms. Urban density effects are not robust to controlling for firm characteristics, suggesting that variety mechanisms dominate pure scale effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides firm-level evidence that agglomeration benefits operate through specific mechanisms (related variety, knowledge spillovers) rather than simply urban scale, refining understanding of what makes locations valuable. The finding that related variety matters most for manufacturing suggests that access to specific industry ecosystems—not merely any large city—determines productivity and survival. This nuances housing justice arguments: if agglomeration benefits are industry-specific, then housing constraints in particular specialized regions (e.g., tech hubs, financial centers) may have concentrated distributional effects on workers in those fields. The survival analysis demonstrates that location affects not just productivity levels but also firm viability, raising stakes for access debates.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using detailed data from a UK science park, this paper examines how firm co-location decisions respond to agglomeration externalities from neighboring firms. The author finds that firms value proximity to technologically similar neighbors (measured by patent overlap), with effects on innovation output (patent production). The paper provides causal evidence by exploiting quasi-random assignment of locations within the park, showing that firms deliberately "choose the neighbor before the house"—prioritizing proximity to knowledge-related firms over building characteristics. Knowledge spillovers operate at very localized scales (within building or adjacent buildings).

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates the extreme geographic localization of knowledge spillovers, showing that agglomeration benefits operate at building-level proximity in science-intensive contexts. This micro-geographic evidence strengthens arguments against housing fungibility: if productivity benefits require same-building or adjacent-building proximity, then access to specific neighborhoods or even buildings within high-productivity cities matters, not merely city-level access. For housing justice, this suggests that exclusionary practices operating at neighborhood scales (local zoning, building restrictions) can prevent access to highly localized agglomeration benefits, raising questions about whether such fine-grained exclusion can be reasonably accepted.

  pages = {706--719},
  doi = {10.1080/00343404.2018.1470325},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Focusing on Ecuadorian cantons, this paper investigates whether tertiarization (shift toward services) and urbanization affect agglomeration economies in developing country contexts. Using GMM estimation controlling for endogeneity, the authors find stronger agglomeration effects for services than manufacturing. Critically, they identify a threshold of urbanization (33% urban population) at which diversity, density, and competition externalities all generate positive effects; in highly urbanized areas, congestion effects emerge. Below this threshold, agglomeration benefits are limited or negative.

  RELEVANCE: This developing country context demonstrates that agglomeration benefits are not automatic—they depend on reaching threshold urbanization levels and service sector development. This suggests that the non-fungibility of locational value varies across contexts: in less urbanized or manufacturing-dominant regions, location may matter less for productivity. For housing justice debates, this implies that arguments for access to high-productivity locations have strongest force in contexts that have reached sufficient urbanization and economic complexity to generate agglomeration externalities. The identification of congestion thresholds also informs optimal density debates, suggesting that agglomeration benefits can be exhausted at very high density.

  pages = {209--230},
  doi = {10.1111/ehr.12786},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This historical analysis examines the role of industrial structure in labor productivity growth in US manufacturing cities during the "second industrial revolution" (1880-1930). The authors find that initial specialization was associated with faster subsequent productivity growth, demonstrating dynamic Marshallian externalities. Only extremely high levels of diversity (found in a few very large cities) showed positive correlation with growth. The impact of industrial specialization raised labor productivity in manufacturing by approximately 4 percent by 1920.

  RELEVANCE: This historical evidence demonstrates that agglomeration externalities and their productivity effects are not merely contemporary phenomena but have operated throughout industrial development. The finding that specialization drove productivity growth during a transformative economic period suggests that clustering effects are fundamental to innovation and technological change, not just routine production. For housing justice arguments, this long-run historical perspective shows that access to productive locations has shaped economic opportunity and inequality for over a century, suggesting that housing constraints limiting such access have deep structural consequences. The 4% productivity gain from specialization, while smaller than contemporary estimates, operated over just three decades.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Indonesian microdata, this paper quantifies wage premia associated with agglomeration externalities, controlling for individual worker characteristics. The author finds significant positive effects of urban density on wages, with effects larger in service sectors than manufacturing. Specialization and diversity externalities both show positive wage effects, though magnitudes vary by industry. The paper demonstrates that spatial wage differentials in Indonesia reflect productivity differences from agglomeration, not merely cost-of-living differences or worker sorting.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides international evidence that agglomeration externalities translate into measurable wage premia, showing that location-specific productivity gains are captured in worker compensation. The wage premium evidence directly connects to housing justice arguments about access to opportunity: if agglomeration generates higher wages, then housing constraints that prevent workers from accessing high-productivity locations limit both individual earnings and efficient labor allocation. The Indonesian context demonstrates that these effects operate in developing as well as developed economies, suggesting broad relevance. For contractualism, wage premia evidence shows that exclusion from productive locations imposes concrete economic costs on excluded workers.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper empirically investigates sources of spatial wage disparity in Thailand using two-stage estimation with instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity. Results show that worker education and experience affect wage differentials, but workers also benefit from agglomeration externalities of large cities, with effects statistically significant even after controlling for individual characteristics. The effect of agglomeration externalities on wages is substantial, suggesting that Thailand's low urbanization rate and high urban primacy (concentration in Bangkok) limits broader access to agglomeration benefits.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides additional international evidence on how agglomeration externalities translate into wage premia, with particular attention to the distributional consequences of concentrated urbanization. The finding that Thailand's urban primacy limits agglomeration benefit access connects to housing justice concerns about spatial concentration: when agglomeration benefits are geographically concentrated in one dominant city, housing constraints in that city have particularly severe exclusionary effects. The policy recommendation for multiple regional cities suggests that dispersing agglomeration benefits may be preferable to concentrating them, informing debates about optimal spatial distribution of development opportunities.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using micro-level data from Ukrainian manufacturing and service firms (2005, 2013), this paper studies how agglomeration externalities and market structure determine total factor productivity (TFP). The authors find that various agglomeration externalities (specialization, diversity, competition) significantly affect TFP after controlling for firm characteristics (intangible assets, capital intensity, size, ownership, internationalization). Results confirm the importance of agglomeration externalities even in transition economy contexts with less developed market institutions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that agglomeration externalities operate even in contexts with weaker institutions and less developed economies, suggesting that the productivity benefits of clustering are robust across institutional environments. For housing justice arguments, this implies that the efficiency case for enabling access to productive locations applies broadly, not merely in advanced economies with strong market institutions. The finding that both specialization and diversity externalities matter suggests multiple pathways through which location generates value, strengthening arguments that locational value is substantial and non-exportable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines how agglomeration externalities affect new venture survival using Swedish data. The authors find that both specialization (localization) and diversity (urbanization) externalities reduce firm exit probability, with effects varying by industry and firm type. Entrepreneurial firms particularly benefit from diverse urban environments that provide access to variety in knowledge, labor, and resources. The paper demonstrates that location decisions at founding significantly affect long-run firm survival prospects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides evidence that agglomeration externalities affect not just productivity levels but firm survival, raising stakes for location access. For entrepreneurial workers, access to productive locations may determine whether their ventures succeed or fail, not merely their income levels. This connects to housing justice arguments about opportunity: if housing constraints prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from accessing locations with agglomeration benefits that enable firm survival, such constraints limit not just employment opportunities but also entrepreneurial pathways to economic advancement. The finding that effects are strongest for entrepreneurial firms suggests that housing constraints may particularly harm innovation and new firm formation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using comprehensive UK firm-level data (1997-2013), this paper examines the agglomeration externalities generated by fast-growth firms on other firms in the same region and industry. Results show robust evidence of positive spillovers on labor productivity of non-fast-growth firms, demonstrating that high-growth firms generate benefits beyond their own operations. However, externalities on employment growth are negative, suggesting labor poaching and local competition effects. The paper distinguishes between productivity and employment externalities, showing that fast-growth firms generate knowledge spillovers but compete for local labor.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides evidence that agglomeration externalities are not uniformly positive—fast-growth firms generate productivity spillovers but also create competitive pressures through labor market effects. For housing justice debates, this complexity suggests that location value encompasses both benefits (productivity spillovers) and costs (increased competition), with distributional implications. Workers may benefit from proximity to fast-growth firms through productivity spillovers but face wage competition and potential displacement. This nuances arguments about access: the desirability of location depends on whether workers can capture spillover benefits or merely face increased competition and costs.

  POSITION: Agglomeration externalities with attention to both positive spillovers and competitive effects.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper calculates the proportion of jobs at high risk of automation across European regions using 2018 Labor Force Survey data, then examines relationships between automation vulnerability, agglomeration characteristics, and labor market structure. Results indicate that regions at low vulnerability to automation benefit from unrelated variety and high population density, while regions with high concentrations of clerical, craft, and machine operator jobs face greater disruption risk. Agglomeration externalities appear protective against automation risk in knowledge-intensive contexts but offer less protection in routine-task-intensive regions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects agglomeration externalities to future labor market dynamics, showing that the protective value of urban location may vary with automation trends. For housing justice arguments, this suggests that access to productive locations matters not just for current wages but for resilience against technological disruption. Regions with diverse, knowledge-intensive economies offer workers both agglomeration benefits and protection against automation, while routine-task-intensive regions face compounding disadvantages. Housing constraints that prevent workers from accessing automation-resistant locations may impose long-run costs beyond immediate productivity effects, raising intergenerational justice concerns.

  POSITION: Agglomeration externalities in context of automation and future labor market change.
