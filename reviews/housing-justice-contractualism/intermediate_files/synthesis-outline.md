## Introduction

**Purpose**: Establish the contractualist framework for housing justice and preview the four key failings that motivate the research.

**Content**:
- Housing crises across liberal democracies reveal fundamental tensions in how contractualist theories handle property, place, and coercion (Halliday & Meyer 2024)
- Standard contractualist approaches (Rawlsian primary goods, Scanlonian reasonable rejection) face four systematic problems when applied to housing:
  - The fungibility assumption treating housing as substitutable with other goods
  - The occupancy vs. access stand-off between incumbent protection and newcomer claims
  - Housing's irreducible dual role as both necessity and wealth-accumulation asset
  - Epistemic duties to future generations when planning decisions create irreversible path dependencies
- Preview: This review synthesizes philosophical and empirical literature establishing that housing justice requires distinctive contractualist treatment beyond general distributive principles

**Key Papers**:
- Rawls (1971, 1993) - Foundational contractualist framework and primary goods
- Halliday & Meyer (2024) - State-of-the-art survey identifying gaps in housing justice philosophy
- Stilz (2019) - Occupancy rights and territorial sovereignty

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: The Fungibility Assumption and Location-Specific Value

**Section Purpose**: Establish that housing generates non-fungible, location-specific value that resists standard contractualist metrics (primary goods, equality of resources).

**Main Claims**:
1. Dominant contractualist frameworks implicitly assume goods are fungible—commensurable via a single metric (primary goods index, resource equality, capabilities)
2. Agglomeration economics demonstrates that location creates irreducible productive value through mechanisms (knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, shared infrastructure) that cannot be exported or replicated (Duranton & Puga 2004, Hsieh & Moretti 2019)
3. Philosophical theories of positional goods and contextual value provide conceptual tools for non-fungible goods, but have not been systematically applied to housing and location

**Subsection 1.1: Primary Goods and the Fungibility Assumption**

**Papers**: Rawls (1971, 2001), Dworkin (1981), Freeman (2018), Anderson (1999)

**Content**:
- Rawls's primary goods framework treats goods as "all-purpose means" valuable across conceptions of the good, enabling index-based comparisons
- Dworkin's equality of resources explicitly requires fungibility via hypothetical auction and envy test
- Critics (Anderson, capability theorists) challenge resource-based approaches but often presume fungibility at capability level
- The frameworks enable contractualist justification by abstracting from particular attachments, but this abstraction may fail for goods whose value is constituted by context

**Gap Connection**: If housing's value is location-specific in ways that resist commensuration, standard contractualist approaches lack adequate tools.

**Subsection 1.2: Location-Specific Value and Agglomeration**

**Papers**: Hsieh & Moretti (2019), Ganong & Shoag (2017), Duranton & Puga (2004), de Groot et al. (2016)

**Content**:
- Agglomeration externalities create productivity gains of 36% lost GDP growth when housing constraints prevent optimal sorting (Hsieh & Moretti 2019)
- Three mechanisms (sharing, matching, learning) generate location-specific value that is non-exportable (Duranton & Puga 2004)
- Housing supply constraints ended regional income convergence by redirecting low-skill workers away from high-productivity locations (Ganong & Shoag 2017)
- Meta-analyses confirm robust agglomeration effects, particularly knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling (de Groot et al. 2016)

**Gap Connection**: Empirical magnitude of non-exportable locational value challenges any simple fungibility assumption in housing justice.

**Subsection 1.3: Positional Goods and Contextual Value**

**Papers**: Brighouse & Swift (2006), Cass (2023, 2024), Walzer (1983), Sen (1985), Nussbaum (2011), Kymlicka (1989, 1995)

**Content**:
- Positional goods (value depending on relative standing) generate convergence among egalitarian principles (Brighouse & Swift 2006)
- Cass refines this for civic status: relational equality requires relatively equal access to location-based civic participation (Cass 2023, 2024)
- Walzer's pluralism and Miller's contextual principles recognize distinct spheres resistant to cross-sphere commensuration
- Capabilities approach highlights conversion factors but may preserve fungibility at capability level (Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2011)
- Kymlicka establishes precedent for context-dependent goods (cultural membership) as primary goods, suggesting space for non-fungible goods within liberal frameworks

**Gap Connection**: While positional and contextual approaches provide tools, they haven't been systematically applied to housing's location-specific value.

**Section Summary**: Location generates non-fungible value through agglomeration mechanisms and civic participation requirements, challenging standard contractualist metrics that assume fungibility. This creates the first failing: contractualist principles premised on commensurable goods cannot adequately handle housing where location constitutes rather than merely affects value.

**Word Target**: 1200-1400 words

## Section 2: Competing Claims and Structural Tensions

**Section Purpose**: Map the occupancy/access deadlock and housing's dual-role problem, showing how these create contractualist impasses where no principles can satisfy all affected parties.

**Main Claims**:
1. Occupancy rights literature establishes robust incumbent claims to place-stability but systematically neglects excluded outsiders' access claims, creating a contractualist blind spot
2. Housing financialization has intensified the dual-role problem where housing must simultaneously serve as affordable necessity and wealth-accumulation asset—a structural contradiction
3. Property-owning democracy (POD) applied to housing faces justifiability problems: appreciation enriches owners but excludes newcomers; suppression attacks incumbent security

**Subsection 2.1: The Occupancy vs. Access Stand-Off**

**Papers**: Stilz (2019), Huber & Wolkenstein (2018), Lloyd (2023), van Leeuwen (2024), Mancilla (2020), Dawkins (2023), Draper (2022)

**Content**:
- The "occupancy turn" grounds territorial rights in individuals' located life plans rather than collective self-determination (Stilz 2019)
- Extended to gentrification: residents have rights to remain where social practices are anchored, including protection against neighborhood transformation (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018)
- Recent work recognizes occupancy harms beyond displacement—community goods destruction, relational equality threats (Lloyd 2023, Dawkins 2023)
- Democratic participation dimensions intensify occupancy claims (Draper 2022)
- Critical voices note occupancy theory privileges settled over mobile populations (Mancilla 2020) and focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection without addressing exclusion
- Van Leeuwen's comprehensive survey confirms field consensus on protecting incumbents but notes systematic neglect of newcomer claims (van Leeuwen 2024)

**Gap Connection**: Occupancy literature provides rich resources for incumbent claims but cannot satisfy contractualist requirements because it fails to justify protection to excluded outsiders who also need access to pursue life plans.

**Subsection 2.2: Housing Financialization and the Dual-Role Problem**

**Papers**: Fikse & Aalbers (2020), Ryan-Collins (2019, 2021), Fuller et al. (2019), Kemeny (1981), Christophers (2019), Dewilde & De Decker (2015)

**Content**:
- Fikse & Aalbers identify "the really big contradiction": financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations—appreciation as wealth store systematically destroys affordability (Fikse & Aalbers 2020)
- Housing-finance feedback cycle emerged from pro-homeownership policy plus credit liberalization, creating structural necessity for appreciation (Ryan-Collins 2019)
- Wealth inequality now driven primarily by housing price dynamics, not income or homeownership rates (Fuller et al. 2019)
- Kemeny's dualist/unitary system distinction suggests structural design shapes whether dual-role tension is tractable (Kemeny 1981)
- Tenure inequality (privileging ownership over rental) is root cause of housing wealth inequality (Christophers 2019)
- Financialization correlates with deteriorating affordability for low-income households even pre-crisis (Dewilde & De Decker 2015)

**Gap Connection**: The dual-role problem creates contractualist impasse—policies enabling appreciation cannot be justified to excluded newcomers; policies suppressing prices cannot be justified to incumbent owners whose housing is their primary asset.

**Subsection 2.3: Property-Owning Democracy and Housing's Dual Role**

**Papers**: O'Neill & Williamson (2012), Freeman (2013, 2018), Thomas (2016), Erck (2024), Gregory (2016), Halliday & Meyer (2024)

**Content**:
- POD requires dispersed capital ownership to prevent domination and secure opportunity (O'Neill & Williamson 2012, Freeman 2013, Thomas 2016)
- Freeman emphasizes democratic reciprocity and self-respect as central to POD, not merely distributive patterns (Freeman 2018)
- Erck develops housing limitarianism within POD framework, arguing for wealth ceilings on housing ownership (Erck 2024)
- Gregory's critique: homeownership-based POD creates anti-egalitarian dynamics rather than dispersing wealth (Gregory 2016)
- Halliday & Meyer note philosophical literature has inadequately addressed macroeconomic dimensions of housing and price dynamics (Halliday & Meyer 2024)

**Gap Connection**: POD faces justifiability problems when applied to housing because dispersed homeownership creates wealth inequality through appreciation, yet suppressing appreciation undermines the asset-based security POD aims to provide. Neither appreciation nor suppression can satisfy contractualist reasonable acceptance requirements.

**Section Summary**: These structural tensions—occupancy vs. access, necessity vs. asset—create contractualist deadlocks where protecting some parties' legitimate claims necessarily violates others' equally legitimate claims. Standard contractualist frameworks lack resources to resolve these tensions because they presume commensurable goods and reciprocal justifiability, conditions that break down in housing contexts.

**Word Target**: 1400-1600 words

## Section 3: Intergenerational Justice and Epistemic Duties

**Section Purpose**: Establish that urban planning's irreversibility and epistemic uncertainty about future preferences generate distinctive obligations that standard contractualist frameworks inadequately address.

**Main Claims**:
1. Planning decisions bind future generations through path dependencies and irreversible commitments, but their preferences remain epistemically uncertain
2. Epistemic justice frameworks provide resources for theorizing duties to future knowers that do not require social relations or reciprocity
3. Option-preservation approaches under uncertainty offer alternative to optimization-based planning that embeds contested assumptions about future values

**Subsection 3.1: Intergenerational Obligations Under Epistemic Uncertainty**

**Papers**: Gosseries (2009), Timmer (2024), Bengtson (2025), Lippert-Rasmussen (2025), Zwarthoed (2016), Doorn (2025)

**Content**:
- Standard intergenerational justice theories struggle with non-overlapping generations due to absence of reciprocity or social relations (Gosseries 2009)
- Relational egalitarian approaches face "intergenerational justice dilemma" because future generations lack social relations in relevant sense (Bengtson 2025, Lippert-Rasmussen 2025)
- Sufficientarian approaches (Timmer 2024) provide threshold-based duties distinct from optimization, better handling preference uncertainty
- Option-preservation frameworks: we owe future generations adequate option-sets for autonomous choice, not optimized outcomes based on predicted preferences (Zwarthoed 2016, Doorn 2025)
- Irreversibility of certain decisions (environmental loss, urban form) strengthens case for option preservation over optimization (Doorn 2025)

**Gap Connection**: If relational approaches fail intergenerationally and optimization requires contested preference predictions, contractualism needs alternative foundations for duties to future generations.

**Subsection 3.2: Epistemic Justice and Planning Authority**

**Papers**: Fricker (2007, 2013), Medina (2013), Anderson (2012), Byskov & Hyams (2023), Halsband (2022)

**Content**:
- Epistemic injustice wrongs people specifically as knowers through testimonial injustice (credibility deficit) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking interpretive resources) (Fricker 2007)
- Medina extends to structural dimensions—credibility excess of dominant groups and need for epistemic friction/meta-lucidity about one's limitations (Medina 2013)
- Epistemic justice as condition for political freedom: without testimonial standing and hermeneutical resources, citizens cannot contest decisions, enabling domination (Fricker 2013)
- Institutional design for epistemic justice requires systems that correct bias and include marginalized voices (Anderson 2012)
- Planning contexts systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others (Byskov & Hyams 2023)
- AI-supported optimization in long-term planning embeds contestable assumptions about future preferences, committing hermeneutical injustice (Halsband 2022)

**Gap Connection**: Planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit epistemic injustice against future generations by constraining their interpretive capacities.

**Subsection 3.3: Epistemic Duties as Intergenerational Obligations**

**Papers**: Chan (2025), McCauley et al. (2018), Green & Brandstedt (2020), Gough (2015)

**Content**:
- Chan argues we owe future generations capacity-preservation—transforming oppressive social categories so future people can relate as equals (Chan 2025)
- Parallel argument: we owe future generations epistemic capacity-preservation—maintaining interpretive frameworks and option-sets supporting autonomous interpretation
- Infrastructure decisions (including urban planning) create long-lived path dependencies that bind future generations (McCauley et al. 2018)
- Principles-first optimization approaches are necessarily indeterminate under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future values (Green & Brandstedt 2020)
- Need-based approaches provide more epistemically secure grounds than preference-based approaches for intergenerational obligations (Gough 2015)

**Gap Connection**: Epistemic approaches to intergenerational duties may succeed where relational approaches fail because epistemic harms (constraining interpretive capacity) do not require social relations. This provides contractualism with resources for theorizing obligations to future generations without presuming reciprocity.

**Section Summary**: Urban planning's irreversibility creates duties to preserve options and interpretive capacity for future generations whose preferences we cannot know. Epistemic justice frameworks provide grounds for these duties that do not require reciprocity or social relations, offering contractualism resources for extending obligations intergenerationally. This addresses the fourth failing: standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize epistemic duties under uncertainty.

## Section 4: Alternative Normative Frameworks

**Section Purpose**: Survey competing approaches to housing justice (human rights, capabilities, relational equality) to position contractualism's distinctive contribution and challenges.

**Main Claims**:
1. Human rights approaches ground housing in dignity and subsistence needs, offering strong protections but facing questions about content specification and enforcement
2. Capabilities approaches focus on functionings and conversion factors, potentially preserving fungibility at capability level
3. Relational equality emphasizes social standing and domination, connecting to housing's civic and community dimensions but struggling intergenerationally

**Subsection 4.1: Rights-Based Approaches**

**Papers**: Wells (2019), Shue (2020), Essert (2016)

**Content**:
- Wells defends right to autonomous dwelling (not mere shelter) grounded in individual autonomy, requiring stable, private, adequate housing for minimum 3 years (Wells 2019)
- Shue establishes housing as basic right because necessary for enjoying all other rights—subsistence rights alongside security and liberty (Shue 2020)
- Essert argues property institutions failing to ensure shelter access are morally deficient—property rights require justification through adequate provision (Essert 2016)
- Rights approaches provide strong normative foundations but face challenges: content specification (how much housing?), trade-offs (rights conflicts), and institutional design (who provides?)

**Subsection 4.2: Capabilities and Conversion Factors**

**Papers**: Kimhur (2024), Dummer & Neuhäuser (2025), Sen (1985), Nussbaum (2011), Anderson (1999), Batterham (2020)

**Content**:
- Kimhur develops capabilities approach focused on housing opportunities, securities, and abilities rather than resource distribution (Kimhur 2024)
- Dummer & Neuhäuser argue capabilities approaches must integrate relational dimensions, particularly self-respect (Dummer & Neuhäuser 2025)
- Sen emphasizes conversion factors—location as environmental factor affecting capability generation (Sen 1985)
- Anderson's democratic equality focuses on capabilities for functioning as equals, not metric resource equivalence (Anderson 1999)
- Batterham identifies methodological challenges: derivation procedures, justice connection, causal analysis of capability deprivation (Batterham 2020)
- Question remains whether capabilities approaches escape fungibility assumption or merely shift it to capability level

**Subsection 4.3: Relational Equality and Domination**

**Papers**: Cass (2023, 2024), Jenkins (2022), Wells (2021), Pettit (2012)

**Content**:
- Cass argues relational equality has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions—civic status depends on relative standing and unfolds over time (Cass 2023, 2024)
- Residential segregation creates hierarchical civic status incompatible with relational equality even if absolute standards met
- Jenkins analyzes gentrification as domination—arbitrary interference by landlords and developers undermining freedom as non-domination (Jenkins 2022)
- Wells emphasizes state-led gentrification's expressive harms to self-respect and equal standing (Wells 2021)
- Pettit distinguishes legitimacy (how coercion imposed) from justice (what order imposed), arguing legitimacy requires non-domination not hypothetical consent (Pettit 2012)
- Relational approaches face intergenerational difficulties due to absence of social relations with future people

**Section Summary**: Rights, capabilities, and relational approaches each offer resources for housing justice but face distinctive challenges. Contractualism must explain whether it provides better answers to content specification, fungibility, and intergenerational problems, or whether it requires integration with these alternative frameworks.

**Word Target**: 700-900 words

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Synthesize systematic gaps and position the research project's contribution.

**Gap 1: Contractualist Application to Housing**

**Evidence**:
- Halliday & Meyer (2024) identify need for normative frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality
- Contractualist foundations literature (Domain 1) shows minimal engagement with housing, property regimes, or land use regulation
- Applied ethics literature relies primarily on human rights, capabilities, or relational frameworks
- No systematic application of Rawlsian or Scanlonian contractualism to housing that addresses the four failings

**Why it matters**: Housing involves direct state coercion (eminent domain, zoning, displacement) requiring justification to all affected parties—precisely the domain where contractualist reasonable rejection should apply. Yet contractualist theory has not developed tools for housing's distinctive features.

**How research addresses it**: Develops contractualist framework specifically for housing by showing where standard approaches fail (four failings) and what resources contractualism needs to address them.

**Gap 2: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Literature**

**Evidence**:
- Urban economics on agglomeration (Domain 6) operates independently from philosophical distributive justice debates
- Housing systems literature (Domain 7) documents financialization empirically but lacks normative analysis
- Philosophical housing justice (Domain 8) rarely engages with macroeconomic evidence (Halliday & Meyer 2024)
- Occupancy rights literature (Domain 3) doesn't incorporate spatial misallocation findings showing aggregate costs

**Why it matters**: Normative principles must address actual housing dynamics—financialization, agglomeration, spatial sorting—not idealized markets. Philosophical analysis detached from institutional reality lacks policy relevance.

**How research addresses it**: Synthesizes agglomeration economics showing non-fungible locational value, housing financialization literature revealing dual-role contradiction, and contractualist principles to develop integrated framework.

**Gap 3: The Occupancy/Access Deadlock**

**Evidence**:
- Occupancy rights literature (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein, Lloyd) focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection
- Van Leeuwen's (2024) survey confirms systematic neglect of newcomer/excluded access claims
- Mancilla (2020) notes privilege of settled over mobile populations
- No papers directly address how occupancy protection can be justified to excluded outsiders or how access claims can be justified to vulnerable incumbents

**Why it matters**: This is a paradigmatic contractualist problem—we have competing legitimate claims that cannot both be fully satisfied. Contractualism should provide tools for resolving or at least clarifying such conflicts, yet the literature doesn't frame it this way.

**How research addresses it**: Frames occupancy/access tension as contractualist impasse requiring principles justifiable to both incumbents and excluded outsiders, not merely incumbent protection.

**Gap 4: Epistemic Duties in Planning**

**Evidence**:
- Intergenerational justice literature addresses preference uncertainty but rarely integrates epistemic justice frameworks
- Epistemic justice literature (Fricker, Medina, Anderson) focuses on contemporaneous relationships
- Planning under uncertainty treated as technical problem (optimization, risk management) rather than epistemic justice issue
- Doorn (2025) and Zwarthoed (2016) gesture toward option preservation but don't develop full epistemic justice foundation

**Why it matters**: If planning decisions constrain future generations' interpretive capacities by foreclosing options or imposing present frameworks, this constitutes distinctive epistemic harm that requires justification. Standard contractualist frameworks lack resources for theorizing such harms.

**How research addresses it**: Develops epistemic duties to future generations as constraint on present planning authority, using epistemic justice frameworks (Fricker, Medina, Anderson) extended intergenerationally via capacity-preservation arguments.

**Gap 5: Housing's Dual Role Under Contractualism**

**Evidence**:
- Housing systems literature documents dual-role contradiction (Fikse & Aalbers 2020, Ryan-Collins 2019)
- Property-owning democracy literature addresses dispersed ownership but not housing-specific problems (O'Neill & Williamson 2012, Freeman 2013)
- Gregory (2016) shows homeownership-based POD fails egalitarian aims
- No work examines whether any housing price policy (appreciation or suppression) can meet contractualist reasonable acceptance standards

**Why it matters**: If housing must simultaneously be affordable necessity and wealth store, yet appreciation undermines affordability and suppression attacks security, no policy can satisfy reasonable acceptance by both owners and non-owners. This reveals fundamental limits of contractualist justification in housing contexts.

**How research addresses it**: Tests POD against contractualist justifiability standards when applied to housing, showing that dual-role problem creates principled impasse—neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies reasonable rejection criteria for all affected parties.

**Synthesis**: These gaps collectively reveal that housing justice requires distinctive theoretical treatment beyond general distributive principles. The research contributes by: (1) applying contractualist frameworks systematically to housing; (2) integrating empirical evidence on agglomeration and financialization with normative analysis; (3) framing occupancy/access as contractualist impasse; (4) developing epistemic duties for intergenerational planning; and (5) testing POD's limits when housing serves dual role.

**Word Target**: 900-1100 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize findings and position research contribution.

**Content**:
- The four failings of standard contractualist theories when applied to housing are systematic, not merely gaps in application:
  - Fungibility assumption fails because location generates non-exportable value through agglomeration mechanisms
  - Occupancy/access creates contractualist deadlock where protecting either party violates the other's legitimate claims
  - Housing's dual role under financialization makes it impossible to satisfy both owners (requiring appreciation) and non-owners (requiring affordability)
  - Epistemic duties to future generations under planning irreversibility require frameworks standard contractualism lacks
- These failings reveal that housing requires distinctive contractualist treatment, not merely application of general principles
- The research contributes by developing contractualist resources for addressing non-fungible goods, competing legitimate claims, structural contradictions, and epistemic duties under uncertainty
- Expected contribution: Not a comprehensive solution to housing justice, but clearer analysis of where contractualist justification reaches its limits and what normative resources are needed to address housing's distinctive features

**Word Target**: 400-500 words
