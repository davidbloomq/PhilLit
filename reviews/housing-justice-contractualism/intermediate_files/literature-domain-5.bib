====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Intergenerational justice concerns obligations present generations owe to future generations, especially under conditions of uncertainty and irreversibility. The field addresses fundamental questions: Can we have duties to non-existent people? What do we owe those whose preferences remain unknown? How should we balance present needs against future welfare when our decisions have permanent consequences?

Three major debates structure this domain. First, the non-identity problem (Parfit) questions whether we can harm future people when our choices determine who exists. Second, theories of obligation divide between reciprocity-based accounts (Gosseries), sufficientarian approaches (Timmer), and relational egalitarian frameworks (Bengtson, Lippert-Rasmussen). Third, the role of uncertainty creates tensions between optimization, satisficing, and option-preservation strategies.

Epistemic justice literature (Fricker 2007, Medina 2013) traditionally addresses testimonial and hermeneutical injustices against marginalized groups. Recent work extends these concepts to planning and policy contexts (Anderson 2012, Byskov & Hyams 2023), revealing how decision-making frameworks can systematically exclude certain forms of knowledge or impose epistemic harms on future generations. The connection between epistemic constraints and intergenerational obligations remains underexplored, creating an opening for arguments that epistemic humility about future preferences demands preserving options rather than optimizing based on present assumptions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the core tension in the research project: urban planning decisions bind future generations whose preferences are unknown, creating both epistemic constraints (we cannot know what they will value) and irreversibility (urban form persists across generations). The literature provides frameworks for thinking about obligations under uncertainty, the moral significance of option preservation, and how epistemic duties to future knowers might constrain present decision-making authority.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While intergenerational justice literature addresses uncertainty about future welfare, it rarely engages systematically with epistemic justice frameworks. Conversely, epistemic justice literature focuses primarily on contemporaneous relationships, not duties to future knowers. The intersection—epistemic duties to future generations as a constraint on present planning authority—remains largely untheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Look for connections between: (1) Gosseries and Fricker on how reciprocity/credibility structures might extend intergenerationally; (2) Zwarthoed and Medina on how option preservation relates to epistemic capacity-building; (3) Doorn 2025 and Anderson 2012 on institutional design for epistemic justice under uncertainty. The sufficientarian literature (Timmer, Benbaji) may provide resources for thinking about threshold duties distinct from optimization.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Contractualism (Rawls, Gosseries): 5 papers - Obligations grounded in hypothetical agreement or reciprocity across generations
- Sufficientarianism (Timmer, Benbaji): 3 papers - Threshold-based duties distinct from maximization or equality
- Epistemic Justice (Fricker, Medina, Anderson): 5 papers - Duties to recognize diverse knowers and avoid testimonial/hermeneutical harms
- Option Preservation (Zwarthoed, Doorn): 2 papers - Obligations to maintain choice-sets rather than optimize
- Relational Egalitarianism (Bengtson, Lippert-Rasmussen, Chan): 3 papers - Justice as equal social relations extended intergenerationally

  title = {Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker introduces the concept of epistemic injustice—wronging someone specifically in their capacity as a knower. She distinguishes testimonial injustice (deflating someone's credibility due to prejudice) from hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to interpret one's experiences due to marginalization). Both forms constitute distinctive wrongs because they damage people's epistemic agency, not merely their material interests. She argues epistemic justice requires cultivating intellectual virtues like testimonial sensitivity.

  RELEVANCE: While Fricker focuses on contemporaneous relationships, her framework is essential for theorizing epistemic duties to future generations. If present planning decisions constrain future people's epistemic capacities—by foreclosing interpretive frameworks or imposing hermeneutical gaps—this constitutes an epistemic harm distinct from material harm. The project extends Fricker's framework to intergenerational contexts: we owe future generations not just resources but epistemic standing, which requires preserving interpretive options rather than optimizing based on present conceptual schemes.

  POSITION: Foundational work in epistemic justice theory; virtue-epistemology approach emphasizing individual responsibility for testimonial fairness.

  year = {2013},
  address = {Oxford},
  isbn = {978-0-19-992902-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Medina extends Fricker's framework by emphasizing credibility excess (not just deficit) and developing the concept of meta-lucidity—critical awareness of one's epistemic limitations. He argues epistemic injustice is structural, not merely interpersonal, requiring collective resistance through what he calls "epistemic activism." Dominant groups suffer from epistemic arrogance and hermeneutical ignorance, actively resisting knowledge that threatens their privilege. Epistemic justice demands cultivating epistemic friction—discomfort that prompts questioning one's assumptions.

  RELEVANCE: Medina's structural analysis illuminates how planning institutions might systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others, including those of future generations. His concept of meta-lucidity—awareness that our interpretive resources are limited and potentially distorting—directly supports arguments for epistemic humility in long-term planning. If we recognize we cannot know future preferences and our conceptual schemes may be parochial, this epistemic friction should constrain optimization-based approaches that assume present frameworks adequately capture all relevant values.

  POSITION: Critical development of epistemic injustice emphasizing structural dimensions, collective resistance, and epistemic virtue as cultivated friction.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational edited volume systematically addresses whether justice applies across non-overlapping generations. Gosseries' contribution analyzes three models of intergenerational reciprocity: descending (parents to children), ascending (children to parents), and double reciprocity. He argues that while direct reciprocity fails between non-overlapping generations, indirect reciprocity through chains of obligation can ground duties to the distant future. The volume addresses the non-identity problem, theories of sustainability, and competing accounts of what we owe posterity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how obligation-structures might extend intergenerationally despite lack of reciprocal capacity. The project's argument about epistemic duties to future generations requires showing these duties persist even when future people cannot reciprocate. Gosseries' work on indirect reciprocity and chain-of-obligation models provides resources for this move. Additionally, his treatment of uncertainty and competing sustainability principles (sufficientarian vs. egalitarian) directly engages questions about option preservation vs. optimization under epistemic constraints.

  POSITION: Contractualist framework emphasizing reciprocity and sustainability principles; edited volume establishing core debates in contemporary intergenerational justice theory.

@article{anderson2012epistemic,

  title = {Epistemic Justice as a Virtue of Social Institutions},
  journal = {Social Epistemology},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {26},
  number = {2},
  pages = {163--173},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2011.652211},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson shifts epistemic justice from individual virtue ethics (Fricker) to institutional design. She argues social institutions—not just individuals—can exhibit epistemic justice or injustice through their testimonial gathering and assessment systems. Institutions that systematically exclude certain voices or fail to design mechanisms correcting for bias instantiate epistemic injustice. She emphasizes that institutional solutions may succeed where individual virtue-cultivation fails, because cognitive biases are often difficult for even well-intentioned individuals to overcome.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for the project's institutional focus on urban planning. If epistemic justice requires institutional design that counteracts bias and includes diverse perspectives, then planning institutions making irreversible decisions about future urban form face distinctive epistemic duties. Anderson's framework supports arguments that planning processes must incorporate mechanisms for recognizing epistemic uncertainty about future values—not merely better individual epistemic virtues in planners, but institutional structures that preserve options precisely because we institutionally recognize our epistemic limitations regarding future generations.

  POSITION: Institutional approach to epistemic justice; shifts focus from individual virtue to systems design for testimonial fairness.

  volume = {190},
  number = {7},
  pages = {1317--1332},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-012-0227-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker argues epistemic justice is constitutive of political freedom in the republican tradition of non-domination (Pettit). If citizens suffer testimonial or hermeneutical injustice, they cannot effectively contest political decisions—lacking either credibility or interpretive resources to articulate grievances. Thus epistemic injustice enables domination: the capacity of others to interfere arbitrarily in one's affairs. Epistemic justice becomes not merely a virtue but a precondition for legitimate political authority.

  RELEVANCE: Extends epistemic justice to political legitimacy, directly relevant to planning authority. If legitimate political power requires that those subject to it can meaningfully contest decisions, and epistemic injustice disables contestation, then planning decisions that bind future generations while denying them epistemic standing may lack legitimacy. The project can argue: binding future generations to irreversible urban forms without preserving their epistemic capacity to interpret and contest those forms constitutes a form of domination—arbitrary interference they cannot resist because they lack both presence and (if we impose rather than preserve frameworks) adequate hermeneutical resources.

  POSITION: Republican political philosophy; epistemic justice as constitutive of non-domination and political legitimacy.

  journal = {Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {29},
  number = {2},
  pages = {219--236},
  doi = {10.1007/s10806-015-9597-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zwarthoed argues that leaving future generations a world of artificial substitutes for nature (plastic trees, electronic birds) wrongs them even if these substitutes satisfy their preferences—because such a world fails to secure adequate options for autonomous choice. Drawing on autonomy-based theories, she contends we have duties to preserve genuine natural environments not because future people will necessarily prefer them, but because adequate option sets require availability of diverse authentic experiences. Option preservation is distinct from preference satisfaction: we owe future generations real choices, not optimized outcomes based on predicted preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the option preservation framework central to the project. Zwarthoed provides philosophical resources for distinguishing preservation duties from optimization: even if we could predict future preferences accurately (we cannot), we would still owe them adequate options rather than merely satisfying predicted preferences. Applied to urban planning: irreversible decisions that foreclose future options (e.g., permanently precluding certain urban forms) wrong future generations by constraining their autonomous choice, regardless of whether the imposed form satisfies their predicted preferences. The argument reinforces epistemic humility: uncertainty about future values strengthens rather than weakens the case for option preservation.

  POSITION: Autonomy-based account of intergenerational obligations; option preservation distinct from preference satisfaction or optimization.

  volume = {36},
  number = {4},
  pages = {368--386},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820824000049},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmer defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for intergenerational justice. He distinguishes a deprivation threshold (minimum needs) from an affluence threshold (comfortable life), arguing that freedom from deprivation in one generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another, but does not lexically outweigh freedom from deprivation in other generations. This avoids both extreme prioritarianism (which could demand impoverishing present generation for marginal future benefits) and weak sufficientarianism (which permits affluence for present at cost of future deprivation). Sufficientarian principles are distinctively appropriate for intergenerational contexts because they respect both urgency of basic needs and independence of different generations' claims.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a threshold-based alternative to optimization that respects irreducibility of different generations' claims. For the project: if intergenerational obligations are sufficientarian (securing thresholds) rather than maximizing (optimizing welfare), this supports preserving options sufficient for future flourishing rather than optimizing based on predicted preferences. The lexical priority of avoiding deprivation over increasing affluence suggests planning should prioritize preserving essential options (housing, mobility, public space) rather than optimizing for predicted preferences that might sacrifice these essentials. This approach handles uncertainty better than optimization because thresholds are more robust to preference-variation than optimal points.

  POSITION: Sufficientarian theory of intergenerational justice with lexical priorities; threshold-based approach as alternative to optimization or egalitarianism.

@article{bengtson2025intergenerational,

  journal = {Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {28},
  number = {3},
  pages = {402--420},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2025.2462360},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bengtson argues relational egalitarianism faces a fundamental dilemma regarding intergenerational justice. Relational egalitarianism holds justice requires equal social relations, but non-overlapping generations lack social relations in the relevant sense. Attempts to extend relational egalitarianism intergenerationally by weakening the notion of "social relations" either fail to ground distinctively relational (vs. distributive) requirements, or fail to ground egalitarian (vs. sufficientarian) requirements. He concludes relational egalitarianism cannot justify obligations to future generations without abandoning core commitments.

  RELEVANCE: While challenging relational egalitarianism, Bengtson's analysis illuminates constraints on intergenerational obligation-theories. For the project: if relational accounts struggle with future generations due to absence of reciprocal social relations, this strengthens the case for epistemic-duty approaches that do not require reciprocity. Epistemic duties to avoid wronging future knowers can persist without social relations: we owe them adequate epistemic resources (hermeneutical frameworks, option-sets supporting autonomous interpretation) not because we relate to them socially, but because our decisions determine their epistemic capacities. This suggests epistemic approaches may handle intergenerational contexts better than relational ones.

  pages = {382--401},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2025.2462359},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lippert-Rasmussen examines whether relational egalitarians can accommodate intergenerational justice by redefining "social relations" to include non-overlapping generations. He evaluates multiple proposals (indirect relations through chains, causal relations, community membership, institutional relations) and argues each faces a dilemma: either the relations become too thin to ground distinctively relational (vs. distributive) obligations, or they fail to ground egalitarian (vs. merely sufficientarian) requirements. The temporal non-overlap problem reveals fundamental tensions in relational egalitarianism's conceptual structure.

  RELEVANCE: Deepens understanding of why relational frameworks struggle intergenerationally. For the project: the failure of relation-based theories strengthens alternative approaches grounded in capacity-respect rather than relationship. Epistemic duties not to wrong future knowers need not depend on social relations—we violate these duties by constraining their epistemic capacities through our choices (hermeneutical injustice), regardless of whether we stand in social relations. The argument can proceed: while relational egalitarianism founders on temporal non-overlap, epistemic justice theories can extend intergenerationally because epistemic harms transcend the requirement for contemporaneous social relations.

  number = {3},
  pages = {464--480},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2025.2462363},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chan defends relational egalitarianism against intergenerational objections by arguing we owe future generations not merely resources but the capacity to relate to each other as equals. This requires transforming oppressive social categories (race, gender, class) that structure unequal relations. Failing to transform these categories constitutes a double wrong: unjust relations with contemporaries and wronging future people who inherit oppressive category-structures. The duty extends across non-overlapping generations because social categories persist intergenerationally, even when particular relations do not.

  RELEVANCE: Chan's argument about transforming social categories to preserve future relational capacity parallels the project's argument about preserving future epistemic capacity. Just as oppressive categories constrain future people's capacity for equal relations, constraining interpretive frameworks and option-sets constrains future people's epistemic capacities. The parallel strengthens the case that we have duties to preserve conditions for future capacities (whether relational or epistemic) even absent direct relations with future people. Applied to planning: irreversible decisions that foreclose frameworks future people might use to interpret and contest urban form wrong them by constraining their epistemic capacity, similar to how perpetuating oppressive categories wrongs them relationally.

  journal = {Journal of Risk Research},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1080/13669877.2025.2569441},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Doorn applies intergenerational justice principles to risk management, arguing that irreversibility and option-foreclosure constitute distinctive wrongs to future generations. She defends an option-preservation framework: under uncertainty about future values and facing potentially irreversible planetary losses, present generations have duties to preserve option-sets rather than optimize based on current risk assessments. The argument combines uncertainty about future preferences with irreversibility of certain losses to ground strong duties against foreclosing options, even when optimization-approaches might recommend accepting irreversible risks.

  RELEVANCE: Directly parallels the project's argument structure applied to environmental rather than urban contexts. Doorn's framework for environmental option-preservation under uncertainty transfers to urban planning: irreversible decisions about urban form under epistemic uncertainty about future preferences trigger duties to preserve options rather than optimize. Her treatment of irreversibility is especially relevant—certain urban decisions (e.g., highway locations, density patterns, infrastructure commitments) are practically irreversible across generations. Combined with epistemic uncertainty about future values, this grounds strong duties to preserve diverse urban options rather than locking in single optimized forms based on present assumptions.

  number = {2},
  pages = {e807},
  doi = {10.1002/wcc.807},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Byskov and Hyams apply epistemic injustice concepts to climate adaptation policy, arguing that adaptation planning systematically marginalizes Indigenous knowledges through testimonial injustice (discrediting Indigenous testimony) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to recognize Indigenous knowledge systems). They identify five conditions demonstrating epistemic injustice in adaptation planning: systematic underrepresentation of Indigenous knowledge, credibility deficits due to prejudice, exclusion from knowledge-generating processes, hermeneutical marginalization, and political powerlessness. Epistemic justice in adaptation requires not merely including Indigenous voices but transforming the epistemic frameworks structuring policy discourse.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how epistemic injustice operates in long-term planning contexts under uncertainty—precisely the domain of the research project. While Byskov and Hyams focus on Indigenous knowledge, their framework illuminates how planning institutions systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others. Extended to intergenerational context: planning processes that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations—they inherit a world structured by our conceptual schemes without adequate resources to interpret or contest it. The argument strengthens the case for epistemic humility in irreversible planning decisions.

  number = {2},
  pages = {187--193},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-024-09667-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Inoue challenges Sommers' defense of relational egalitarianism's intergenerational extension, arguing that relational egalitarianism faces comparative disadvantages in justifying present duties to future generations. Unlike distributive theories (utilitarianism, prioritarianism, luck egalitarianism), relational egalitarianism cannot appeal to time-invariant principles because its principles are context-sensitive—they depend on existing practices and relationships. This context-sensitivity makes it harder to ground duties to future generations absent actual relations. The "chain-relatedness" problem shows relational egalitarianism struggles to justify why present persons have duties to remote future others.

  RELEVANCE: While critical of relational approaches, Inoue's analysis clarifies advantages of non-relational theories for intergenerational contexts. For the project: epistemic duty-approaches can avoid Inoue's objection because epistemic harms (testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice) do not require social relations to constitute wrongs. We can wrong future people epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities through our choices, regardless of whether we stand in social relations with them. This suggests epistemic approaches may be better suited than relational ones for grounding intergenerational obligations, especially regarding irreversible decisions under uncertainty.

  number = {7},

  doi = {10.3390/su14073922},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Halsband examines AI decision-support systems used for long-term policy planning from an intergenerational justice perspective. She argues these systems embed controversial assumptions about social discounting (devaluing future welfare) and future preferences that significantly influence policy outcomes. AI systems making these assumptions opaque commit a form of hermeneutical injustice: they structure decision-making using frameworks that future generations cannot meaningfully interpret or contest. Sustainable AI requires transparency about embedded assumptions and recognition that optimization-based approaches conceal normative choices affecting future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's concerns about optimization under uncertainty. Halsband shows how AI-supported optimization in long-term planning (for climate policy, but applicable to urban planning) systematically privileges present frameworks while constraining future interpretive capacity. Her analysis strengthens arguments for epistemic humility: when decision-support systems optimize based on assumptions about future preferences, they impose hermeneutical frameworks on future generations who cannot contest them. Option-preservation approaches that acknowledge epistemic uncertainty may be more just than optimization-approaches that embed contestable assumptions in technical systems future generations inherit but cannot challenge.

  doi = {10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.005},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McCauley et al. synthesize energy justice research, identifying three core dimensions: distributional justice (how costs/benefits are allocated), procedural justice (who participates in decision-making), and recognition justice (respect for diverse values and knowledge systems). They emphasize temporal dimensions of energy justice—decisions about energy infrastructure bind future generations while affecting them unequally. The authors argue energy transitions raise distinctive intergenerational justice concerns because infrastructure choices are long-lived, capital-intensive, and path-dependent, creating lock-in effects that constrain future options.

  RELEVANCE: The framework transfers directly to urban planning, which shares energy infrastructure's characteristics: long-lived, capital-intensive, path-dependent, and binding on future generations. The three dimensions—distributional, procedural, recognition—map onto the project's concerns: distributional (who bears costs of irreversible decisions), procedural (how can absent future people participate), and recognition (what epistemic duties to recognize future values we cannot predict). The recognition dimension is especially relevant: if justice requires recognizing diverse values and knowledge systems, this supports preserving options for future generations whose values we cannot adequately represent within present frameworks.

  number = {5},
  pages = {1191--1214},
  doi = {10.1093/cje/bev039},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gough argues that addressing climate change requires a theory of well-being grounded in universal human needs rather than preferences, happiness, or capabilities. Need-theory provides objective, universalizable, non-substitutable, and satiable criteria for evaluating intergenerational obligations. Unlike preferences (which are subjective, endogenous, and limitless) or happiness (which adapts to circumstances), needs are necessary preconditions for avoiding serious harm across all contexts. Satiability and non-substitutability of needs are critical for sustainability: once needs are met, further accumulation is not morally required, and certain natural goods (clean air, stable climate) cannot be substituted by other goods.

  RELEVANCE: Gough's need-based approach provides resources for thinking about intergenerational obligations under epistemic uncertainty. While we cannot predict future preferences, we can identify universal needs that constrain what we owe them. For the project: even if we cannot know future preferences regarding urban form, we can identify basic needs (housing, mobility, public space, health) that urban planning must preserve. This supports option-preservation over optimization: rather than optimizing for predicted preferences (epistemically uncertain), planning should ensure adequate options for meeting universal needs (epistemically more secure). The argument creates threshold constraints on planning authority: irreversible decisions must preserve conditions for future need-satisfaction, even if we cannot optimize for future preferences.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Green and Brandstedt critique "principles-first" approaches to climate ethics that derive action-guidance by applying general principles to empirical facts. They argue such approaches are indeterminate (leave open crucial normative choices), fail to engage actual agents of change, and are unlikely to influence real-world action. They advocate "engaged methods"—developing normative theory through interaction with actual change agents, allowing their practical contexts and constraints to inform the content of normative principles rather than merely their application. This methodological shift reflects recognition that normative complexity under uncertainty cannot be resolved by mechanical application of general principles.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on climate ethics methodology, the critique applies to intergenerational planning generally. The project can build on Green and Brandstedt's critique of optimization-based approaches: under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future values, principles-first optimization approaches are necessarily indeterminate—they require contestable assumptions about future preferences that cannot be resolved through philosophical analysis alone. This methodological point strengthens the case for epistemic humility: rather than pretending we can derive determinate optimization-solutions through philosophical principles, we should acknowledge irreducible normative uncertainty and preserve options precisely because we cannot resolve these normative questions on behalf of future generations.

  POSITION: Methodological critique of principles-first approaches in climate ethics; advocates engaged methods responsive to practical contexts.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass and Campos introduce a special issue examining whether relational egalitarianism—the view that justice requires equal social relationships—can accommodate intergenerational obligations. They frame the challenge: absence of coexistence and other features of intergenerational contexts make it unclear whether many justice ideals apply. Relational egalitarianism appears particularly vulnerable because it explicitly grounds justice in social relations that seem absent between non-overlapping generations. The papers in the volume explore whether relational egalitarianism can extend intergenerationally and what modifications might be required.

  RELEVANCE: While this is an introduction rather than substantive argument, it usefully frames debates about extending justice theories intergenerationally. For the project: the difficulties relational egalitarianism faces in intergenerational contexts highlight potential advantages of alternative approaches. If justice-theories requiring social relations or reciprocity struggle intergenerationally, this opens space for approaches grounded in capacity-respect or harm-avoidance that do not require relations. Epistemic justice theories may have structural advantages here: we can wrong future people epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities without needing to stand in social relations with them.

  POSITION: Overview of relational egalitarianism and intergenerational justice debates; frames challenges for extending relational theories.
