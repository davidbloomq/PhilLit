DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines comparative housing systems and the financialization of housing markets, focusing on how different institutional arrangements shape housing's dual role as both necessity and asset. Key debates center on Kemeny's distinction between dualist housing systems (where owner-occupation and social rental compete) versus unitary systems (where private and social rental compete, depressing homeownership). The tenure neutrality debate concerns whether housing policy should favor particular tenure forms or remain neutral. Since the 1980s, housing financialization has transformed housing's economic role across advanced economies through credit liberalization, securitization, and the emergence of housing as a primary wealth store. This has created feedback cycles between finance and property markets, concentrated wealth inequalities, and made housing affordability increasingly dependent on access to credit rather than income alone.

Research shows housing wealth is now more unequally distributed than income in most OECD countries, with implications for intergenerational inequality as parental resources increasingly determine housing outcomes. The financialization process varies across national contexts due to differences in mortgage systems, welfare regimes, and regulatory frameworks, producing distinct varieties of residential capitalism. Asset-based welfare regimes increasingly position homeownership as a substitute for social welfare provision, creating precarity for those excluded from ownership.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the structural context for the dual-role problem. When housing systems financialize and homeownership becomes the normalized tenure, households face the contradiction that Fikse and Aalbers identify: housing must appreciate to serve as wealth store, yet affordability requires low prices. Different housing system designs affect whether this tension is tractable under contractualist standards. Kemeny's dualist/unitary distinction suggests system-level design choices that shape whether the asset/necessity tension can be mediated. The tenure neutrality debate reveals normative questions about whether policy should favor homeownership or maintain neutrality—questions with direct contractualist implications.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical analysis of tenure neutrality as a normative principle. Few studies connect housing system design to distributive justice theories beyond empirical inequality measures. Underdeveloped analysis of how financialization affects the feasibility of different housing institutional designs.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Connect Kemeny's dualist/unitary typology to the dual-role problem's tractability. Examine whether tenure neutrality could serve as a contractualist principle. Analyze how financialization constrains or enables different system designs. Consider whether comparative evidence suggests any system successfully mediates the asset/necessity tension.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Kemeny dualist/unitary systems (4 papers): Housing system typology based on rental sector organization
- Tenure neutrality advocates (3 papers): Policy should not favor particular tenures
- Financialization critics (7 papers): Credit-driven housing transformation creates inequality and instability
- Asset-based welfare analysts (4 papers): Homeownership increasingly substitutes for welfare provision

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ryan-Collins argues housing affordability and wealth inequality crises stem from a feedback cycle between finance and landed property, created by pro-homeownership policy coupled with credit liberalization. Under these conditions, land becomes the most attractive collateral for banks and the most desirable asset for households, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where credit expansion drives house prices, which justifies further lending. This housing-finance cycle emerged in Anglo-Saxon economies in the 1980s but has spread globally.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is foundational for understanding the dual-role problem's emergence. The feedback cycle Ryan-Collins describes explains why the asset/necessity tension intensifies over time: as housing financializes, price appreciation becomes structurally necessary to validate lending and household wealth strategies, making affordability increasingly incompatible with the system's operation. The paper's focus on demand-side reforms (banking regulation, land policy) versus supply-side reforms directly addresses policy tractability under contractualist constraints.

  POSITION: Represents the political economy critique of housing financialization, arguing the crisis requires macroeconomic policy reform rather than merely increasing supply. This contrasts with supply-focused approaches that dominate policy discourse.

  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2020.1784395},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fikse and Aalbers identify a fundamental contradiction between homeownership discourses (affordable homeownership, conservative finance, asset-based welfare, tenure neutrality) and reality (declining affordability, risky finance, unequal wealth distribution, lack of tenure neutrality) in Belgium. They argue financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations—the more housing functions as financial asset, the less it can function as affordable social necessity. This "really big contradiction" echoes Kemeny's "really big trade-off" but focuses on internal contradictions within homeownership ideology itself.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly articulates the dual-role problem at the heart of this research project. The Belgian case demonstrates how financialization makes the asset/necessity tension irreconcilable within a homeowner society: policies that support housing as wealth store systematically undermine affordability. The four discourses they identify (especially tenure neutrality) reveal how policy rhetoric obscures this contradiction. Their finding that discourses persist despite contradictory reality suggests ideological rigidity that may constrain contractualist reform.

  POSITION: Critical of financialized homeownership, showing contradictions between policy discourse and outcomes. Builds on Kemeny while extending analysis to financialization era.

  title = {The Myth Of Home Ownership: Private Versus Public Choices In Housing Tenure},
  year = {1981},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kemeny's foundational work challenges the ideological assumption that homeownership is inherently superior to renting, arguing this "myth" obscures genuine policy choices about housing provision. He introduces the distinction between dualist housing systems (where social rental is residualized and competes with homeownership) and unitary systems (where non-profit and private rental compete, with homeownership less dominant). Kemeny argues homeownership ideology serves class interests by privatizing housing security while reducing pressure for comprehensive welfare provision—the "really big trade-off" between homeownership and welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Kemeny provides the foundational typology for understanding how housing system design affects the dual-role problem. His dualist/unitary distinction suggests system-level structural choices that shape whether housing can simultaneously serve as necessity and asset. Dualist systems may intensify the dual-role tension by making homeownership the only path to housing security, while unitary systems might ease it by providing quality rental alternatives. His critique of homeownership ideology is essential for contractualist analysis of whether pro-homeownership policy can be justified.

  POSITION: Foundational critical perspective on homeownership ideology, establishing the comparative housing systems framework that shapes subsequent research. Argues for rethinking housing tenure as political choice rather than natural preference.

  title = {The Rise and Fall of Social Housing? Housing Decommodification in Long-run Comparison},
  journal = {Journal of Social Policy},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {53},
  pages = {970--996},
  doi = {10.1017/S0047279422000770},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl et al. present new long-run data on social housing shares across 48 countries since 1900, documenting the "rise and fall" of housing decommodification. They identify three housing groups: residual (Anglo-Saxon), socialist, and Northern European (where public housing remained resilient). Contrary to classical welfare state theories, social housing is better explained by housing shortages and complementarities with rental policies than by GDP or left-wing government. The decline was steep but uneven—some countries maintained substantial social sectors through resilient public housing associations.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides empirical grounding for assessing whether decommodified housing sectors can mediate the dual-role problem. The finding that social housing persisted where rental policies were strong suggests system-level complementarities matter more than simple welfare-state capacity. The long-run perspective reveals that housing decommodification trajectories differ from classical welfare state patterns, suggesting housing requires distinct institutional analysis. For contractualism, the question is whether robust social housing provision could reduce dependence on homeownership as wealth store, easing the dual-role tension.

  POSITION: Empirical comparative-historical approach documenting varieties of housing decommodification. Challenges conventional housing typologies by showing they lack temporal stability. Argues for including housing in welfare state research rather than treating it as separate domain.

  pages = {298--318},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2018.1487037},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Blackwell and Kohl argue that cross-sectional housing typologies (welfare-regime or varieties-of-capitalism based) lack temporal validity. Using long-run data, they show postulated associations between homeownership, welfare, and mortgage debt are historically contingent. They propose historicized typologies that trace housing finance system trajectories and acknowledge path-dependence. Housing systems evolved through distinct historical pathways that cannot be reduced to contemporary welfare-regime or VoC categories, requiring longitudinal analysis that accommodates within-country and between-country variation over time.

  RELEVANCE: This methodological critique is crucial for the project because it warns against assuming housing system types are stable or determined by welfare regime. The dual-role problem may manifest differently across historical contexts even within the same country. For contractualist analysis, this suggests institutional design proposals must account for path-dependence and historical contingency—what works in one context may not transfer. The paper's emphasis on housing finance trajectories also highlights how mortgage system evolution constrains contemporary reform possibilities.

  POSITION: Methodological intervention arguing for path-dependent, historically sensitive comparative housing research. Critiques static typologies that dominate housing studies. Emphasizes housing finance systems as drivers of divergence.

  pages = {49--74},
  doi = {10.1080/09692290.2017.1403358},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Blackwell and Kohl develop the first historically informed typology of housing finance systems, identifying four "ideal types" that emerged in the 19th century: informal person-to-person lending, state lending (solutions outside banking), and deposit-based and bond-based institutions (banking solutions). They adapt Gerschenkron's economic backwardness thesis to explain temporal and spatial emergence, arguing these systems created path-dependent logics whose influence persists over a century later. Early housing finance institutions shaped national trajectories in lasting ways.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explains why mortgage finance systems differ so dramatically across countries—differences that profoundly affect housing financialization and the dual-role problem's intensity. Countries with different mortgage finance origins face different constraints on policy reform. The path-dependence argument suggests that contemporary financialization, while global, operates through nationally specific institutional channels inherited from much earlier periods. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether finance system reform is tractable or locked-in by historical institutional legacies.

  POSITION: Historical institutionalist approach to housing finance. Emphasizes long-run path-dependence from 19th century institutional choices. Provides analytical framework for understanding cross-national mortgage system variation.

  pages = {297--320},
  doi = {10.1080/01402382.2018.1561054},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fuller et al. demonstrate that the political-institutional determinants of income inequality have no effect on wealth-to-income ratios. Instead, rising wealth inequality is driven by housing price increases and other financial asset appreciation, not by homeownership rates or savings rates. This finding challenges both comparative political economy's focus on income inequality and housing studies' focus on ownership rates. The rise in wealth-to-income ratios is fundamentally about asset price inflation, particularly housing, and will increasingly shape intergenerational and class-based political conflict.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes that wealth inequality is now decoupled from income inequality and driven primarily by housing price dynamics. For the dual-role problem, this is critical: housing's function as wealth store depends on price appreciation, which directly undermines affordability. The finding that homeownership rates don't drive wealth inequality suggests the problem isn't ownership per se but price dynamics. This has major contractualist implications—policies addressing housing wealth inequality must target price dynamics rather than merely expanding ownership. The intergenerational dimension highlights contractualist concerns about fairness across age cohorts.

  POSITION: Political economy analysis challenging conventional CPE frameworks by foregrounding wealth over income. Emphasizes housing prices as driver of wealth inequality independent of welfare-state or ownership-rate variables.

  pages = {1724--1738},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2022.2141205},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benites-Gambirazio and Bonneval analyze France as an intermediary housing regime case, tracing how pro-homeownership policies since the 1970s combined with welfare retrenchment and pension reforms from the 1990s to create a distinct Housing Asset-Based Welfare (HABW) regime. Despite France's strong social welfare tradition, policies increasingly positioned homeownership as private wealth strategy, advancing "ordinary financialization" with rising household debt-to-income ratios and unequal homeownership access effects. France exemplifies how asset-based welfare can develop even in strong welfare states.

  RELEVANCE: The French case is crucial because it shows housing financialization and asset-based welfare emerging even in a context with robust social protections—suggesting these are not simply Anglo-Saxon phenomena but broader trends across welfare regime types. This complicates the dual-role problem because it suggests even strong welfare states may be unable to prevent housing's transformation into financial asset. The finding that asset-based welfare develops through combination of pro-homeownership policy and welfare reform indicates the dual-role tension may be policy-constructed rather than inevitable. This has implications for contractualist feasibility: perhaps different policy combinations could prevent or reverse this development.

  POSITION: Extends housing asset-based welfare concept to non-Anglo-Saxon context. Shows financialization compatible with various welfare regime types. Analyzes "ordinary financialization" at household level.

  pages = {459--480},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2022.2056150},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bryant et al. argue household financialization complicates comparative analysis because wealth inequality patterns don't follow classical welfare state categories, though mean wealth levels do. National patterns of wealth inequality reflect asset-based welfare mechanisms centered on housing ownership, inadequately captured by existing welfare-state or VoC literature. They show mortgage default rates following the 2007-08 crisis reflected welfare state categories rather than financial risk measures, revealing an emerging "hybrid" role where social insurance supports household liquidity and asset-based strategies.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that asset-based welfare creates distinct inequality patterns not predicted by welfare regime theory, while maintaining links to welfare state structures. The finding that default rates followed welfare categories rather than financial risk suggests welfare states shape how housing financialization affects households—some welfare states may buffer household risk from housing finance while others don't. This is crucial for contractualism: institutional context determines whether housing asset strategies create precarity or security. The hybrid welfare-finance interaction suggests complexity in reforming housing systems within existing welfare arrangements.

  POSITION: Comparative welfare state analysis incorporating housing financialization. Shows housing wealth inequality follows different logic than income inequality while remaining structured by welfare regimes. Reveals hybrid welfare-finance dynamics.

  pages = {43--60},
  doi = {10.1080/14616718.2014.997431},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aalbers argues the housing crisis stems from the shift to post-Fordist financialized neoliberalism beginning in the 1970s. What appeared as the "Great Moderation" of macroeconomic cycles was actually a "Great Excess" of rising inequality and credit expansion. The crisis wasn't caused by this shift but rather culminated from dynamics introduced decades earlier when states financialized and housing became central to finance-led accumulation. Financialization of housing is thus a critical juncture producing path-dependent dynamics that culminated in crisis.

  RELEVANCE: Aalbers provides the periodization framework for understanding housing financialization's development and the dual-role problem's intensification. His argument that the crisis was built into the post-Fordist housing model suggests the dual-role tension may be structurally irresolvable under financialized conditions without fundamental system change. The critical junctures framework (1970s-80s and post-2007) suggests moments when path-dependence could have been altered. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether incremental reform is possible or whether the housing-finance-inequality nexus requires systemic transformation.

  pages = {121--161},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2015.1109545},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dewilde and De Decker evaluate whether housing financialization correlates with changing inequalities in housing outcomes for low-income owners and private renters across 11-13 Western European countries (1995-2012). They find that increased financialization associates with deteriorating affordability for low-income households relative to middle-income counterparts, controlling for income trends and inequality. Declining affordability was not compensated by improved housing conditions. This trend pre-dates the 2008 crisis, already apparent 1995-2007, suggesting financialization rather than crisis per se drives inequality.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides systematic comparative evidence that housing financialization increases inequality in housing outcomes, specifically harming low-income households' relative position. This directly bears on the dual-role problem: as housing financializes, the affordability dimension deteriorates for those with low incomes even as housing's wealth function strengthens for owners. The finding that this trend preceded the 2008 crisis suggests structural rather than cyclical dynamics. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether any reasonable person would accept institutional arrangements that systematically worsen housing affordability for the least advantaged through financialization.

  POSITION: Quantitative comparative analysis documenting financialization's inequality effects. Challenges crisis-centric explanations by showing trends pre-date 2008. Focuses on housing outcomes rather than system structures.

  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2024.2400155},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl and Wood challenge the view that rising house prices drive fiscal austerity. Using econometric analysis of 19 advanced economies 1980-2018, they show house prices have positive effects on taxation revenue and fiscal spending on public investment, welfare, and education. Multi-level analysis reveals parties respond to rising house prices by proposing more welfare spending. Conterminously rising house prices and rents lead to greater welfare spending, suggesting governments use fiscal policy to protect non-homeowners from labor market risks while supporting house price growth for homeowners.

  RELEVANCE: This finding complicates the dual-role problem by revealing fiscal-housing dynamics. Governments may simultaneously support house price appreciation (benefiting homeowners) while increasing welfare spending (compensating renters/non-owners). This suggests political management of housing's dual role through fiscal redistribution rather than housing policy itself. For contractualism, this raises questions: is fiscal compensation for rising housing costs justifiable, or does it fail to address the underlying problem? Does this create unsustainable fiscal pressures? The finding that parties respond to housing coalitions suggests democratic politics may be structurally biased toward homeowners.

  POSITION: Political economy analysis of fiscal-housing interactions. Challenges austerity-via-housing narrative. Reveals cross-class housing coalitions shaping fiscal politics. Provides recent (2024) update on housing-welfare dynamics.

  volume = {45},
  pages = {561--587},
  doi = {10.1017/SSH.2021.16},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl and Sørvoll explain divergence between Nordic and German-speaking housing regimes through differences in social-democratic ideology and cooperative traditions. Nordic countries moved toward Anglo-Saxon levels of homeownership, mortgage debt, and price increases, while German-speaking countries maintained lower homeownership, private tenancy, lower indebtedness, and stable prices. From the 1920s, Norway developed owner cooperatives (supported by pro-ownership social democracy) while Germany developed tenant cooperatives (supported by anti-ownership social democracy). These differential cooperative pathways created lasting divergence.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that political ideology and organizational form choices in earlier periods profoundly shape contemporary housing system outcomes, including the dual-role problem's intensity. The Nordic trajectory toward high homeownership and debt suggests pro-ownership social democracy may inadvertently intensify the asset/necessity tension, while German tenant cooperatives may ease it by maintaining affordable rental alternatives. For contractualism, this historical analysis shows ideological commitments about property and cooperation have long-run institutional consequences that outlast the ideologies themselves. Current housing system constraints reflect past political choices.

  pages = {573--594},
  doi = {10.1177/0308518X19876946},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Christophers argues understanding and addressing housing asset-based inequalities requires analyzing ownership and rental relationally rather than focusing solely on ownership. Tenure inequality (ideological and economic inequality between ownership and rental) is root cause of asset-based inequality. Using UK and Swedish cases, he shows significant asset inequalities emerged through policy-driven tenure inequality where ownership became privileged over rental. (Re)instituting tenure equality principles should be primary political-policy objective to reduce property asset inequalities and prevent intergenerational reproduction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides crucial normative framing for the dual-role problem by arguing tenure inequality is fundamental. If ownership is systematically privileged over rental (through subsidies, ideology, policy), housing's asset function necessarily creates inequality because only owners access wealth accumulation while renters face affordability pressures without wealth benefits. Christophers' argument for tenure equality as policy principle directly parallels contractualist concerns about reasonable rejection: would reasonable persons accept institutional arrangements that systematically privilege one tenure over another? His analysis suggests addressing dual-role problem requires tenure-neutral policy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Arundel challenges the "ideology of mass homeownership" as equalizing mechanism, showing housing equity is starkly concentrated with significant inter- and intra-generational divergences in Britain. Secondary rental-property markets present key dimension of wealth concentration. Younger cohorts face especially disadvantaged prospects. Rooted ideologies of housing-asset-based economic security become questionable in an era of individualized welfare responsibility and concentrated housing wealth.

  RELEVANCE: This paper documents empirical patterns of housing wealth concentration that undermine homeownership's ideological justification as democratizing wealth. For the dual-role problem, this is critical: if housing's wealth function is highly unequal and concentrated among older owner households and secondary property owners, then homeownership cannot serve as general wealth-building strategy while also providing affordable necessity. Arundel's findings on private landlordism suggest financialization creates new investor class extracting rents from non-owners, intensifying the dual-role tension. Intergenerational inequality raises contractualist fairness concerns.

  doi = {10.1177/0042098017711649},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wetzstein identifies an under-recognized emergent global crisis of urban housing affordability resulting from housing expenses rising faster than wages in many urban centers worldwide. This is triggered by post-GFC megatrends: accelerated (re)urbanization of capital and people, cheap credit provision, and rising intra-society inequality. He argues for politicized knowledge production toward achieving affordable urban futures, linking affordability to political-economic spheres of state-market governance, regulation, policy and investment.

  RELEVANCE: This paper frames housing affordability as global crisis rather than local problem, important for recognizing the dual-role problem's scope. The three megatrends Wetzstein identifies (urbanization, credit, inequality) directly relate to housing financialization and the asset/necessity tension. His call for examining state-market governance questions speaks to contractualist concerns about institutional design. The policy-outcome gap he identifies suggests existing policies fail to address the crisis, raising questions about whether incremental reform is sufficient or fundamental restructuring required.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bezemer et al. document the decline of bank credit to non-financial firms relative to credit for real estate and financial assets since the 1990s, raising concerns about growth and stability. They examine credit policies' theoretical case and post-war use, tracing their demise during 1980s market-oriented reconfiguration including pro-homeownership policies favoring mortgages. Empirical analysis of 17 advanced economies 1973-2005 shows credit policy decline significantly associates with lower lending share to non-financial firms. Credit policies may support adequate financing for innovation, industrial development, and low-carbon transition.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals how policy shifts favoring mortgage credit over productive lending contributed to housing financialization and the debt shift toward households. The finding that credit policy decline associates with less business lending shows trade-offs: channeling credit toward housing mortgages means less credit for productive investment. This has direct implications for the dual-role problem: policies supporting housing as wealth store (via mortgage credit availability) may reduce economic dynamism. For contractualism, this raises questions about intergenerational fairness—are credit policies that favor housing over productive investment justifiable?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ryan-Collins examines links between private landed property (PLP) and finance across history. PLP supported modern banking/credit growth, industrialization, and economic democratization. Since 1980s, however, high-income economies' strong PLP preference (homeownership) combined with financial liberalization created land-finance feedback cycle with negative outcomes: affordability crisis for younger/poorer groups, rising wealth inequality as land rents concentrate, economic stagnation via capital misallocation, and financial fragility from household debt. Alternative tenure arrangements and finance/taxation reforms could mediate these dynamics.

  RELEVANCE: This historical analysis provides crucial long-run perspective on housing-finance relationship, showing it's not inherently problematic but becomes so under specific conditions. The land-finance feedback cycle Ryan-Collins describes is the structural mechanism driving the dual-role problem's intensification. His finding that outcomes vary by tenure arrangements and regulation suggests contractualist feasibility: institutional design choices can shape whether housing-finance interactions produce inequality and instability. The focus on Anglo-Saxon "home-owning democracies" provides comparative context showing problem isn't universal but regime-specific.

  POSITION: Historical political economy analysis linking property systems to finance. Shows housing-finance relationship is historically contingent and shaped by policy. Argues current arrangements produce inequality but alternatives exist.
