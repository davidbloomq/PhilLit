## Conclusion

This review has established that housing justice poses systematic challenges to standard contractualist frameworks, revealing four interconnected failings that require either theoretical innovation or recognition of contractualism's limits. These failings are not merely gaps in application but reflect deep tensions between contractualism's core commitments and housing's distinctive features.

First, the fungibility assumption implicit in dominant contractualist metrics fails when confronted with location-specific value. Rawls's primary goods framework treats goods as "all-purpose means" valuable across diverse life plans, enabling index-based comparisons through abstraction from particular attachments (Rawls 1971, 2001). Dworkin's equality of resources similarly depends on fungibility via hypothetical auctions and envy tests (Dworkin 1981). Yet agglomeration economics demonstrates that location generates non-exportable productive value through mechanisms—knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, shared infrastructure—that cannot be replicated elsewhere (Duranton and Puga 2004). Hsieh and Moretti (2019) quantify the magnitude: housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities lowered US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009 by preventing workers from accessing locations where agglomeration externalities would raise their productivity. This is not merely a conversion factor problem addressable through capabilities approaches; it reveals that location constitutes rather than converts value. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing constraints ended regional income convergence by redirecting low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich locations, demonstrating that location-specific value is both substantial and differentially accessible. When goods resist commensuration through any shared metric—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—standard contractualist frameworks lack adequate tools for evaluating their distribution.

Second, the occupancy versus access deadlock creates a contractualist impasse where protecting legitimate claims of one group necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of another. Stilz's (2019) occupancy rights framework grounds territorial rights in individuals' located autonomy interests, establishing that incumbents have weighty claims to remain where life plans are anchored. Extended to gentrification and urban neighborhoods, occupancy theory provides rich resources for understanding incumbent protection (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018; Lloyd 2023; Dawkins 2023). Yet as van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey confirms, the literature systematically neglects excluded outsiders' access claims. Mancilla (2020) notes that occupancy theory privileges settled over mobile populations, failing to address how protection for incumbents can be justified to those who need access to pursue their own located life plans. This is paradigmatic contractualist territory—competing claims that cannot both be fully satisfied—yet contractualism offers no clear resolution. Principles protecting occupancy cannot be justified to excluded workers facing spatial misallocation (Hsieh and Moretti 2019); principles prioritizing access cannot be justified to vulnerable incumbents facing displacement. The deadlock reflects not insufficient philosophical analysis but genuine structural tension in housing contexts where scarcity and agglomeration concentrate opportunity in specific locations that cannot accommodate all legitimate claimants.

Third, housing's dual role under financialization creates a structural contradiction that may exceed contractualist resolution. Fikse and Aalbers (2020) identify "the really big contradiction": financialized homeownership systematically undermines its own ideological foundations because housing appreciation as wealth store destroys affordability. Ryan-Collins (2019, 2021) traces the housing-finance feedback cycle where pro-homeownership policy combined with credit liberalization makes price appreciation structurally necessary, yet this very appreciation prevents newcomers from accessing housing. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics rather than income or homeownership rates, creating intergenerational unfairness as parental housing wealth increasingly determines offspring's housing outcomes. Property-owning democracy, Rawls's preferred institutional framework, faces severe difficulties when applied to housing: dispersed homeownership enables wealth accumulation via appreciation (benefiting owners, excluding newcomers), yet suppressing appreciation attacks incumbent security (Gregory 2016; Erck 2024). Freeman's (2013, 2018) emphasis on democratic reciprocity and self-respect as central to property-owning democracy intensifies the problem—neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies reciprocity requirements because each enriches or protects some while undermining others' legitimate interests. This may reveal principled limits to contractualist justification: when institutional arrangements must serve contradictory functions (affordable necessity and wealth store), no policy can satisfy reasonable acceptance standards for all affected parties.

Fourth, planning's irreversibility under epistemic uncertainty about future preferences generates obligations that standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize. Urban planning decisions create path dependencies binding future generations (McCauley et al. 2018), yet we cannot know future preferences regarding urban form, housing arrangements, or the relative value of density, mobility, and public space. Standard intergenerational justice theories struggle: relational egalitarian approaches face the intergenerational justice dilemma because future generations lack social relations in the relevant sense (Bengtson 2025; Lippert-Rasmussen 2025), while optimization-based approaches require contested assumptions about future values that cannot be justified (Green and Brandstedt 2020). Epistemic justice frameworks provide alternative resources: we may owe future generations epistemic capacity-preservation—maintaining interpretive frameworks and option-sets supporting autonomous interpretation—rather than optimized outcomes based on present assumptions (Fricker 2007, 2013; Medina 2013). Planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations by constraining their capacity to interpret and contest inherited spatial arrangements (Halsband 2022; Byskov and Hyams 2023). Option-preservation approaches under irreversibility (Zwarthoed 2016; Doorn 2025) offer alternatives to optimization, but contractualist frameworks have not adequately integrated epistemic duties that do not require reciprocity or social relations.

These four failings are interconnected. Fungibility assumptions affect how we conceptualize trade-offs between occupancy and access: if location were genuinely fungible, occupancy protection could be compensated through resources enabling relocation, resolving the deadlock. The dual-role problem intensifies both occupancy and access tensions: financialization makes incumbent homeowners dependent on appreciation (strengthening occupancy claims) while excluding newcomers from wealth accumulation (intensifying access claims). Intergenerational epistemic duties constrain planning authority in ways that affect all three synchronic problems: we cannot optimize away the dual-role contradiction on behalf of future generations whose values we cannot know, nor can we foreclose options for future occupancy or access by locking in irreversible spatial patterns.

The housing justice research surveyed here employs primarily human rights, capabilities, and relational egalitarian frameworks (Halliday and Meyer 2024). Wells (2019) defends housing rights grounded in autonomy; Shue's (2020) basic rights framework establishes housing as necessary for enjoying all other rights; Kimhur (2024) and Dummer and Neuhäuser (2025) develop capabilities approaches emphasizing functionings, securities, and self-respect; Cass (2023, 2024) shows how relational equality has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions requiring relatively equal housing access for civic status. These frameworks offer important resources contractualism must engage. Yet Halliday and Meyer identify a gap: the field lacks normative approaches beyond flourishing and relational equality that can address macroeconomic dimensions including housing price dynamics and wealth accumulation through homeownership. This gap suggests space for contractualist contributions.

What would contractualist resources for housing justice require? First, conceptual tools for non-fungible goods where value is constitutively location-dependent. Kymlicka's (1989, 1995) precedent treating cultural membership as a primary good despite context-dependence suggests contractualism can accommodate non-fungible goods, but this requires extending primary goods frameworks or developing alternative metrics that respect irreducible location-specificity. Second, principles for adjudicating between competing legitimate claims when full satisfaction of both is impossible. The occupancy/access deadlock may require acknowledging tragic choices where contractualism reaches justificatory limits, or developing priority rules that themselves can survive reasonable rejection scrutiny. Third, frameworks for institutional evaluation when structures serve contradictory purposes. The dual-role problem suggests contractualism must either show how some institutional design resolves the contradiction (perhaps through robust social housing provision or fundamental finance system reform), or explain what justice requires when no arrangement satisfies all affected parties' reasonable acceptance. Fourth, integration of epistemic duties to future generations that extend obligations beyond reciprocity-based or relation-based frameworks. Chan's (2025) capacity-preservation argument for relational equality provides a model: we owe future generations the capacity to relate (or interpret, or choose) as equals, even absent direct relations with them.

The research project this review supports does not aim to solve housing injustice comprehensively. Rather, it seeks clearer analysis of where contractualist justification reaches its limits and what normative resources are needed to address housing's distinctive features. The four failings established here—fungibility, occupancy/access deadlock, dual-role contradiction, and epistemic duties under irreversibility—constitute systematic rather than contingent problems. They reveal that housing requires distinctive theoretical treatment beyond applying general distributive principles to a particular good. Whether contractualism can be extended to handle these challenges, or whether they mark principled boundaries of contractualist application, remains to be determined. But establishing that these challenges exist, that they are systematic, and that they reflect deep features of housing rather than theoretical oversights, advances understanding of both housing justice and contractualism's scope and limits.
