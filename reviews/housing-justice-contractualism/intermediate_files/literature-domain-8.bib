====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The applied ethics of housing justice has emerged as a significant field within political philosophy over the last decade, responding to housing crises across Western liberal democracies. The domain encompasses philosophical work on housing rights, homelessness, affordability obligations, and housing allocation, bridging normative theory to policy analysis. Key debates center on whether there exists a human right to housing (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), what states owe to those experiencing homelessness (Essert 2016), how affordability obligations should be distributed, and which ethical frameworks—human rights, capabilities, or contractualism—best address housing justice.

The field divides into several interconnected areas: (1) foundational rights-based approaches arguing for basic housing rights (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), often grounded in dignity, autonomy, or basic needs; (2) capabilities-based approaches (Kimhur 2024, Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user 2025) that focus on what people are able to do and be with respect to housing; (3) applied analyses of specific housing phenomena like gentrification (Dawkins 2023, Lloyd 2023) and housing wealth accumulation (Erck 2024); and (4) recent survey work synthesizing the state of the field (Halliday & Meyer 2024). Essert's (2016) work on homelessness and property rights stands as a foundational text examining state obligations to provide shelter. Wells (2019) offers a distinctive liberal account defending a right to autonomous dwelling. Recent work has expanded to include limitarianism applied to housing (Erck 2024) and integration of relational egalitarian concerns (Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user 2025).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project as it provides the specific applied philosophical literature on housing that contractualist approaches must engage. Understanding existing frameworks—particularly human rights and capabilities approaches—is essential for positioning contractualism's distinctive contributions. The project seeks to show where contractualism adds value and where it faces challenges from these competing frameworks. Papers like Wells (2019), Kimhur (2024), and Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user (2025) represent the state-of-the-art against which a contractualist account must be developed and defended.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial work on housing rights and gentrification, there is limited philosophical engagement with: (1) the macroeconomic and fiscal policy dimensions of housing justice (noted by Halliday & Meyer 2024); (2) explicit contractualist frameworks applied to housing (most work draws on human rights, capabilities, or relational egalitarianism); (3) comparative analysis across different housing tenure systems; and (4) philosophical analysis of housing financialization and its justice implications.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should organize papers around competing normative frameworks (rights-based, capabilities, relational equality) while attending to specific issues (homelessness, gentrification, affordability, allocation). Pay special attention to methodological debates about how housing justice should be theorized and whether housing requires a distinctive approach beyond general distributive justice. The recent survey by Halliday & Meyer (2024) provides an excellent roadmap of the field's current state and future directions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Human rights approach: 6 papers - Housing as basic right grounded in dignity, autonomy, or subsistence (Wells, Shue, Essert)
- Capabilities approach: 4 papers - Housing justice as enabling functionings and capabilities (Kimhur, Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user, Taylor)
- Applied analyses: 5 papers - Specific housing issues through justice lens (gentrification, limitarianism, allocation)
- Survey/overview: 3 papers - State of field and integration (Halliday & Meyer, Shue updated edition)

  title = {The Right to Housing},
  journal = {Political Studies},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {67},
  pages = {406--421},
  doi = {10.1177/0032321718769009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wells defends a basic right to housing specific to Western liberal societies, arguing for a positive right to exercise "lease rights" over a self-contained living space of adequate standard for minimum 3 years. Crucially, she argues this is a right to live alone—communal housing imposed by resource scarcity violates basic rights. The account grounds housing rights in autonomy and the distinctive importance of having a stable, private dwelling space.

  RELEVANCE: Wells provides one of the most developed philosophical defenses of a right to housing in recent literature. Her autonomy-based argument offers a clear alternative to contractualist approaches, and her emphasis on the right to autonomous dwelling (not just shelter) raises important questions about what contractualism must deliver. Her focus on Western liberal contexts parallels this project's scope, making direct comparison feasible.

  POSITION: Liberal rights-based approach grounding housing rights in individual autonomy and the value of having one's own dwelling space, with emphasis on stability and privacy as basic rights.

@article{essert2016property,
  author = {Essert, Christopher},
  title = {Property and Homelessness},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {44},
  pages = {266--295},
  doi = {10.1111/PAPA.12080},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Essert examines the relationship between private property rights and homelessness, arguing that property institutions that fail to ensure everyone has access to shelter are morally deficient. He develops an account of what the state owes to those experiencing homelessness, arguing that property rights carry with them obligations to ensure basic shelter. The state's enforcement of property rights against the homeless is justified only if alternative shelter is genuinely available.

  RELEVANCE: This is foundational work on homelessness ethics that any contractualist account must engage. Essert's focus on the moral requirements property institutions must meet to be legitimate resonates with contractualist concerns about justification. His analysis of state obligations toward the homeless addresses questions central to what reasonable persons could not reject regarding housing allocation. Essential for understanding how contractualism should approach the most severe housing deprivation.

  POSITION: Property rights theory examining institutional obligations to provide shelter, arguing private property institutions require justification through ensuring basic housing access.

@article{halliday2024justice,
  author = {Halliday, Daniel and Meyer, Marco},
  title = {Justice and Housing},
  journal = {Philosophy Compass},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1111/phc3.12966},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive survey maps the emerging field of housing justice philosophy, identifying five major areas: the value of home, homelessness, gentrification, segregation, and spatial justice. The authors highlight recent contributions while identifying critical gaps, particularly the lack of philosophical engagement with macroeconomic factors (fiscal and monetary policy) affecting housing justice. They advocate for normative approaches beyond human flourishing and relational equality frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most current survey of philosophical work on housing justice and provides essential context for positioning contractualist contributions. Halliday and Meyer's identification of gaps in the literature—especially regarding macroeconomic policy and alternative normative frameworks—suggests space for contractualist approaches. Their call for frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality directly invites consideration of contractualist alternatives. Critical for understanding the state of the art and where this project fits.

  POSITION: Meta-theoretical survey identifying current debates and advocating for broader normative approaches, particularly attention to macroeconomic dimensions of housing justice.

@article{kimhur2024approach,
  author = {Kimhur, Boram},
  title = {Approach to housing justice from a capability perspective: bridging the gap between ideals and policy practices},
  journal = {Housing Studies},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {39},
  pages = {481--501},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2022.2056148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kimhur develops a capabilities approach to housing justice, arguing that housing policy should focus on expanding people's capabilities for housing rather than merely distributing resources or housing units. She proposes evaluating housing justice through three dimensions: housing opportunities, housing securities, and housing abilities. This shifts focus from absolute distributional principles to changes in people's capabilities to lead valued ways of residing.

  RELEVANCE: This represents the most developed recent application of the capability approach to housing justice. Understanding Kimhur's framework is essential for assessing what contractualism offers that capabilities approaches do not. Her focus on bridging ideals and policy practices parallels contractualist concerns about practicability. The project must explain whether contractualism provides different or better policy guidance than her capabilities framework, and whether reasonable rejection can address issues capabilities approaches cannot.

  POSITION: Capabilities approach prioritizing expansion of housing functionings and freedoms over resource distribution, with policy-oriented focus on opportunities, securities, and abilities.

@article{dummer2025housing,
  author = {Dummer, Niklas and Neuh{\"a}user, Christian},
  title = {Housing Justice, Basic Capabilities, and Self-Respect},
  journal = {Journal of Applied Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.70020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dummer and Neuh\u00e4user critically examine the capability approach to housing justice, focusing on Nussbaum's list of basic capabilities. They argue the list inadequately captures fundamental housing justice concerns and requires integration of relational egalitarian considerations. Specifically, they develop self-respect as a basic capability incorporating relational dimensions, arguing an adequate capabilitarian view must address relational aspects of housing beyond individual functionings.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is crucial because it identifies limitations in pure capability approaches and argues for integration of relational concerns—a move that brings capabilities closer to contractualist territory. Their critique suggests space for contractualism to address what capabilities approaches miss. The focus on self-respect and relational dimensions resonates with contractualist concerns about standing and reasonable rejection. Essential for understanding how contractualism might improve on or complement capabilities frameworks.

  POSITION: Modified capabilities approach integrating relational egalitarian concerns, particularly self-respect, as essential to adequate housing justice theory.

@book{shue2020basic,
  author = {Shue, Henry},
  title = {Basic Rights},
  year = {2020},
  edition = {40th Anniversary},
  doi = {10.2307/761904},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shue's classic work on basic rights, updated for its 40th anniversary, argues that subsistence rights (including adequate housing) along with security and liberty rights form the foundation of all other rights. The updated edition includes a new chapter examining how climate change progressively undermines subsistence bases including water, food, and safe housing. Basic rights are those whose enjoyment is essential to the enjoyment of all other rights, making them morally basic.

  RELEVANCE: Though not exclusively about housing, Shue's framework is foundational for human rights approaches to housing justice. His argument that adequate housing is a basic right because necessary for enjoying other rights provides a key alternative to contractualist justifications. The climate change chapter adds urgency to housing rights claims. Essential for understanding how human rights theorists ground housing rights and what contractualism must explain differently or better. The basic rights framework is a major competitor to contractualist approaches in applied ethics.

  POSITION: Human rights approach identifying subsistence rights including housing as morally basic because necessary for enjoyment of all other rights, with updated attention to climate threats.

@article{dawkins2023injustices,
  author = {Dawkins, Casey J.},
  title = {On the Injustices of Gentrification},
  journal = {Housing, Theory and Society},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {40},
  pages = {261--281},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2023.2181863},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dawkins provides a systematic taxonomy of eight distinct injustices associated with gentrification: deprivation, estrangement, erasure, domination, censure, exploitation, disrespect, and marginalization. He argues that understanding gentrification's injustice requires recognizing its plural and contested nature, with domination appearing both as a distinct injustice and as contributing to other forms. The state has ultimate moral obligation to rectify these injustices through institutional reform, not merely to blame individual actors.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive analysis of gentrification injustices is essential for understanding a major applied housing justice issue. Dawkins's pluralistic framework identifying multiple forms of injustice resonates with contractualist concerns about different grounds for reasonable rejection. His emphasis on domination and institutional obligations aligns with contractualist focus on structural justification. The project must address whether contractualism can adequately capture the plural forms of gentrification injustice Dawkins identifies, or whether it reduces them problematically.

  POSITION: Pluralistic injustice framework applied to gentrification, emphasizing domination and state institutional obligations over individual blame.

@article{lloyd2023gentrification,
  author = {Lloyd, Harry R.},
  title = {Gentrification: A philosophical analysis and critique},
  journal = {Journal of Urban Affairs},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {47},
  pages = {1246--1264},
  doi = {10.1080/07352166.2023.2216889},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lloyd argues that philosophical critiques of gentrification have overemphasized residential displacement while neglecting other harms. He contends that even non-displacement gentrification damages local communities by undermining the goods conferred by membership in thriving community. Drawing on social science, he argues gentrification threatens relational equality and violates occupancy rights even without displacement. He proposes Lockean and Walzerian frameworks for critiquing community-damaging gentrification.

  RELEVANCE: Lloyd's focus on community goods and relational dimensions of gentrification injustice beyond displacement provides important perspective for contractualist approaches. His emphasis on occupancy rights grounded in communal labor resonates with contractualist concerns about what participants in social cooperation are owed. The project should consider whether contractualism can better explain the wrongness of community destruction than the Lockean and Walzerian alternatives Lloyd proposes. His theoretically ecumenical approach models pluralistic engagement this project should emulate.

  POSITION: Community-centered critique of gentrification arguing non-displacement harms violate occupancy rights and threaten relational equality through destruction of communal goods.

@article{erck2024housing,
  author = {Erck, Susan},
  title = {Housing Limitarianism: What's Wrong with Owning Excess Homes?},
  journal = {Housing, Theory and Society},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {42},
  pages = {139--154},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2024.2391424},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Erck develops "housing limitarianism"—the doctrine that it is morally wrong to own excess housing while others lack adequate housing, and that governments should limit excessive housing acquisition/consumption. Building on Robeyns's limitarianism, she employs Rawls's property-owning democracy ideal to argue for dispersing homeownership throughout society. She addresses the apparent tension between increasing affordable housing supply and wildlife habitat preservation.

  RELEVANCE: This novel application of limitarianism to housing introduces upper limits on housing wealth as a justice concern. For a contractualist approach, this raises questions about whether reasonable persons could reject principles allowing unlimited housing accumulation. Erck's Rawlsian framing makes the paper especially relevant for assessing contractualism against Rawlsian alternatives. Her attention to environmental justice dimensions (housing vs. wildlife habitat) highlights trade-offs contractualism must address. Important for considering whether contractualism supports housing wealth limits.

  POSITION: Limitarianism applied to housing arguing for moral and political limits on excess homeownership, grounded in Rawlsian property-owning democracy.

@article{kogelmann2025autonomy,
  author = {Kogelmann, Brian},
  title = {Autonomy, zoning, and gentrification},
  journal = {Politics, Philosophy \& Economics},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594x251330912},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kogelmann critically examines the argument that zoning is justified because it facilitates autonomy. After charitable reconstruction, he presents what he considers a decisive objection: while autonomy arguments for zoning ultimately fail, reflecting on the relationship between zoning and autonomy reveals problems with common arguments that gentrification harms autonomy and with typical remedies for gentrification. The analysis shows how autonomy concerns cut against both pro-zoning and anti-gentrification positions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is important for understanding how autonomy-based arguments function (or fail) in housing contexts. Since Wells (2019) grounds housing rights in autonomy, Kogelmann's critique has implications for autonomy-based approaches generally. His analysis of how autonomy considerations interact with property rights, zoning, and gentrification is relevant for contractualist frameworks that must balance personal autonomy against collective concerns. The paper models philosophical engagement with housing policy instruments.

  POSITION: Critical analysis of autonomy arguments in housing policy, arguing they fail to justify zoning and undermine some anti-gentrification positions.

@book{sundstrom2024just,
  author = {Sundstrom, Ronald R.},
  title = {Just Shelter: Gentrification, Integration, Race, and Reconstruction},
  year = {2024},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sundstrom develops a comprehensive theory of spatial justice emphasizing racial justice dimensions. He argues that achieving justice in social-spatial arrangements requires prioritizing moral equality, liberty, distributive justice, equal citizenship, and—given US history of housing discrimination—corrective justice through rectification programs. His account centers racial justice as fundamental to housing justice rather than peripheral concern.

  RELEVANCE: Sundstrom's emphasis on corrective justice for historical racial injustice in housing is crucial for any contractualist account of US housing justice. His framework raises questions about whether contractualism can adequately address backward-looking obligations and structural racism in housing. The integration of spatial justice with racial justice shows how housing justice cannot be treated in isolation from broader social justice concerns. Important for understanding how contractualism must address housing's racial dimensions.

  POSITION: Spatial justice theory centering racial justice and corrective obligations from historical housing discrimination, alongside distributive and equal citizenship concerns.

@article{taylor2020capabilities,
  author = {Taylor, Helen},
  title = {Capabilities, Housing, and Basic Justice: An Approach to Policy Evaluation},
  journal = {Housing, Theory and Society},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {37},
  pages = {311--316},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2019.1708453},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor responds to capabilities approaches to housing policy by arguing that Rawls's theory of justice should not be dismissed as purely resource-focused but can contribute to normative policy evaluation. She suggests Rawls's framework can assist in developing capabilities-based housing policy analysis, proposing integration rather than opposition between Rawlsian and capabilities approaches.

  RELEVANCE: This short paper is valuable for understanding debates about how different justice frameworks relate to housing policy evaluation. Taylor's suggestion that Rawlsian approaches complement rather than compete with capabilities approaches is relevant for considering how contractualist frameworks might integrate with or improve on capabilities approaches. The focus on practical policy evaluation aligns with contractualist concerns about action-guidance.

  POSITION: Integrationist view arguing Rawlsian justice framework can contribute to capabilities-based housing policy evaluation rather than being opposed to it.

@article{batterham2020promise,
  author = {Batterham, Deb},
  title = {The Promise and Problems of Applying the Capabilities Approach to Housing Policy and Research},
  journal = {Housing, Theory and Society},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {37},
  pages = {305--310},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2019.1705387},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Batterham raises three critical issues for capabilities approaches to housing: (1) the process for deriving and specifying housing-related capabilities must be clear and defensible; (2) there must be explicit connection between the concept of justice and housing capabilities; (3) there is need for discussion of different ways to understand causes of capability deprivation, as this affects policy responses. She argues these issues require resolution to realize capabilities approach's promise for housing.

  RELEVANCE: This critical commentary identifies methodological challenges capabilities approaches face in housing contexts—challenges contractualist approaches must either solve or avoid. The emphasis on clear derivation procedures resonates with contractualist insistence on justification through reasonable rejection. The concern about linking justice concepts to specific capabilities is directly relevant to contractualist methodology. Important for understanding what any normative framework for housing must accomplish.

  POSITION: Critical methodological commentary on capabilities approach to housing, identifying needs for clear derivation, justice connection, and causal analysis of capability deprivation.

@article{christmas2025free,
  author = {Christmas, Billy},
  title = {Free to Build: Liberty and Urban Housing},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/papa.12281},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Christmas argues that housing affordability crises in major cities result from political constraints on supply that raise normative questions. He contends these constraints fail to protect residents' normative interests and prohibit mutually beneficial development. Drawing on liberty-based justifications for property rights, he argues rights over commonly used urban space should be assigned to those most local to it, enabling housing expansion through procedures ensuring local benefit.

  RELEVANCE: Christmas provides a distinctively libertarian approach to housing justice focused on removing supply constraints. His liberty-based framework offers a counterpoint to capabilities and human rights approaches, raising questions about whether contractualism should support deregulatory housing policies. The emphasis on mutually beneficial development resonates with contractualist concerns about arrangements all could reasonably accept. Important for understanding libertarian alternatives to welfare-state approaches to housing justice.

  POSITION: Liberty-based argument for deregulation and local control of urban development, emphasizing supply expansion through procedures ensuring mutual benefit.

  arxivId = {2112.01236},
  doi = {10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21486},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Das examines AI-aided allocation of scarce societal resources including housing for homeless people. He argues for closer engagement with political philosophy literature on local justice, which provides frameworks for how societies have framed objectives for allocation problems. The paper explores how ubiquitous data and predictive algorithms create new opportunities and risks for resource allocation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects housing allocation issues to algorithmic fairness and local justice theory. For contractualism, it raises questions about what principles should govern algorithmic allocation systems and whether reasonable persons could reject opaque AI-driven allocation. The focus on homeless housing allocation connects to Essert's concerns about state obligations. Important for understanding how contractualism should approach algorithmic housing allocation systems increasingly used in housing policy.

  title = {Redress and worldmaking: Differing approaches to algorithmic reparations for housing justice},
  journal = {Big Data \& Society},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {10},
  doi = {10.1177/20539517231202983},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zhang distinguishes two concepts of reparations relevant to algorithmic housing justice: reparations as accountability/redress for past injustice, and reparations as constructive worldmaking focused on present/future justice. She applies these to US housing injustice, proposing three interpretations: litigating algorithmic discrimination, computing damages for historical structural injustice, and repurposing algorithms for radical resistance linking reform to structural change.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses algorithmic dimensions of housing injustice, connecting to Das's work on algorithmic allocation. The distinction between backward-looking redress and forward-looking worldmaking is relevant for contractualist approaches that must address both historical housing injustice and future institutional design. Zhang's attention to how algorithmic methods might serve housing justice (not just threaten it) is important for policy-oriented contractualist work.

  POSITION: Applied ethics of algorithmic justice examining how reparations frameworks (both backward and forward-looking) should govern algorithmic approaches to housing injustice.

  doi = {10.1111/anti.12958},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lancione develops a care ethics approach to radical housing justice. While abstract is unavailable, the title suggests examination of how care ethics frameworks might ground more radical approaches to housing justice that go beyond conventional welfare-state interventions. The piece likely explores tensions between care-based and rights-based approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Care ethics represents another major normative framework (alongside rights, capabilities, and contractualism) for housing justice. Understanding how care ethics approaches housing is relevant for assessing contractualism's distinctive contribution. The emphasis on "radical" housing justice suggests attention to transformative rather than merely ameliorative approaches—a dimension contractualist frameworks must address.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wabel and De Beer explore housing justice from theological and built environment perspectives, examining how theology should address housing challenges. They investigate four dimensions: how urban planning can enhance affordable sustainable housing; political-economic-legal conditions affecting housing justice; architectural approaches to exclusionary conditions; and dominant social imaginaries shaping housing development. The piece argues for theological engagement with housing justice.

  RELEVANCE: While theological approaches are distinct from the contractualist framework this project develops, the paper's attention to social imaginaries and how different disciplines conceptualize housing justice provides valuable perspective. The emphasis on connecting principles to built environment and planning parallels contractualist concerns about action-guidance. Theological perspectives offer alternative normative foundations useful for comparative analysis.
