## Section 3: Intergenerational Justice and Epistemic Duties

Urban planning decisions bind future generations through irreversible commitments whose consequences unfold across decades. When present generations shape urban form—determining density patterns, transportation infrastructure, and housing configurations—they structure the material and social environments their successors will inhabit. Yet these long-term planning decisions confront a fundamental epistemic problem: we cannot know future generations' preferences, values, or conceptions of the good. Standard contractualist frameworks, premised on reciprocity and justification to affected parties, struggle with this temporal asymmetry. Future generations cannot participate in present deliberation, cannot reciprocate present sacrifices, and lack the social relations that ground many theories of justice. This section establishes that planning's irreversibility combined with epistemic uncertainty about future preferences generates distinctive obligations that contractualist theory has inadequately theorized. Drawing on epistemic justice frameworks and option-preservation approaches, it argues that contractualism requires resources for theorizing duties to future knowers—duties grounded not in reciprocity or social relations, but in avoiding epistemic harms to those whose interpretive capacities our decisions will constrain.

### Intergenerational Obligations Under Epistemic Uncertainty

Intergenerational justice theory confronts fundamental questions about whether and how present generations can owe duties to those not yet born. Traditional contractualist frameworks emphasize reciprocity: obligations arise from mutual advantage, fair cooperation, or reasonable agreement among parties who stand in social relations (Gosseries 2009). But non-overlapping generations lack these features. Future people cannot reciprocate present sacrifices, cannot participate in present agreements, and do not share contemporaneous social relations with us. This absence raises the question of whether contractualist obligations can extend across the temporal boundary separating generations.

Recent work on relational egalitarianism intensifies this challenge. Relational theories hold that justice requires not distributive patterns but equal social relationships—freedom from domination, equal civic standing, mutual recognition. Yet as Bengtson (2025) demonstrates, relational egalitarianism faces an "intergenerational justice dilemma" because future generations lack social relations in the relevant sense. Attempts to extend relational frameworks intergenerationally by weakening the notion of "social relations"—perhaps through chains of obligation, institutional connections, or community membership—encounter a systematic problem: either the relations become too thin to ground distinctively relational requirements, or they fail to support egalitarian rather than merely sufficientarian obligations. Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) reinforces this diagnosis through systematic evaluation of proposals for extending relational egalitarianism. Each attempt to redefine "social relations" to include non-overlapping generations faces the same dilemma: robust enough to matter but too weak to ground relational equality, or strong enough to ground equality but absent between non-overlapping generations.

These difficulties with reciprocity-based and relation-based theories suggest the need for alternative foundations for intergenerational obligations. Sufficientarian approaches offer one promising direction. Timmer (2024) defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for intergenerational contexts, arguing that freedom from deprivation in one generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another generation, while respecting the independence of different generations' claims. This threshold-based approach avoids both extreme prioritarianism (which could demand impoverishing the present for marginal future benefits) and weak sufficientarianism (which permits present affluence at the cost of future deprivation). Crucially, sufficientarian principles handle uncertainty about future preferences better than optimization-based approaches: while we cannot predict what future generations will prefer, we can identify deprivation thresholds—basic needs whose satisfaction remains necessary regardless of preference variation. This epistemic advantage makes sufficientarianism distinctively appropriate for intergenerational contexts where preference uncertainty is irreducible.

Option-preservation frameworks provide another alternative that responds directly to epistemic uncertainty. Zwarthoed (2016) argues that leaving future generations a world of artificial substitutes for nature—plastic trees and electronic birds—wrongs them even if these substitutes perfectly satisfy their preferences, because such a world fails to secure adequate options for autonomous choice. Drawing on autonomy-based theories, she contends we have duties to preserve genuine options not because future people will necessarily prefer them (we cannot know their preferences), but because adequate option-sets are necessary preconditions for autonomous choice. This distinction between option preservation and preference satisfaction is critical: even if we could predict future preferences accurately (we cannot), we would still owe them real choices rather than merely optimized outcomes. Uncertainty about future values thus strengthens rather than weakens the case for option preservation—precisely because we cannot know what they will value, we must preserve diverse options supporting multiple conceptions of the good.

Doorn (2025) applies this option-preservation framework to risk management contexts involving irreversibility. She argues that irreversible losses—environmental damage that cannot be remedied, species extinctions, climate tipping points—trigger particularly strong duties to avoid foreclosing options. When decisions have permanent consequences that bind future generations, and when we face epistemic uncertainty about future values, we have duties to preserve option-sets rather than optimize based on current assessments. Applied to urban planning, this framework suggests that irreversible decisions about urban form—highway locations that permanently structure mobility patterns, density configurations that determine social possibilities, infrastructure commitments that lock in energy systems—create strong duties to preserve diverse urban options rather than optimizing for present assumptions about future preferences.

Gough (2015) reinforces these arguments through a need-based theory of intergenerational obligations. He argues that need-theory provides objective, universalizable, and non-substitutable criteria that are epistemically more secure than preference-based approaches. While preferences are subjective, endogenous, and limitless—varying across individuals and contexts in ways we cannot predict—needs are necessary preconditions for avoiding serious harm across all contexts. This epistemic advantage is decisive for intergenerational obligations: we can identify universal needs (housing, mobility, health, public space) that constrain what we owe future generations, even when we cannot predict their particular preferences. Moreover, the satiability of needs provides principled constraints on present accumulation: once basic needs are met, further optimization is not morally required. For urban planning, this suggests threshold constraints on irreversible decisions—planning must preserve conditions adequate for meeting universal needs, even if optimization for predicted preferences remains epistemically impossible.

### Epistemic Justice and Planning Authority

Epistemic justice theory provides conceptual resources for understanding duties to future generations that do not require reciprocity or social relations. Fricker's (2007) foundational work distinguishes testimonial injustice—deflating someone's credibility due to prejudice—from hermeneutical injustice—lacking conceptual resources to interpret one's experiences due to marginalization from knowledge-generating practices. Both forms constitute distinctive wrongs because they damage people's epistemic agency, their capacities as knowers. Critically, epistemic harms need not depend on the structure of social relations in ways that justice as equal relationships does. We can wrong someone epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities or excluding their testimony, regardless of whether we stand in reciprocal relations with them.

Fricker (2013) extends epistemic justice to political legitimacy through republican theory. She argues that epistemic justice is constitutive of political freedom understood as non-domination: if citizens suffer testimonial or hermeneutical injustice, they cannot effectively contest political decisions because they lack either credibility or interpretive resources to articulate grievances. Epistemic injustice thus enables domination—the capacity of others to interfere arbitrarily in one's affairs. This connection between epistemic justice and political legitimacy has direct implications for planning authority. If legitimate political power requires that those subject to it can meaningfully contest decisions, and epistemic injustice disables such contestation, then planning decisions binding future generations while denying them epistemic standing may lack legitimacy. Future generations cannot contest present planning decisions not merely because they are absent, but also because—if we impose frameworks rather than preserve options—they will lack adequate hermeneutical resources to interpret and challenge the urban forms they inherit.

Medina (2013) develops the structural dimensions of epistemic injustice, introducing concepts directly relevant to planning contexts. He emphasizes credibility excess (not merely deficit)—dominant groups whose testimony receives unwarranted credibility—and develops "meta-lucidity," critical awareness of one's epistemic limitations. Epistemic injustice operates structurally through institutions that privilege certain frameworks while marginalizing others, with dominant groups actively resisting knowledge that threatens their privilege. Crucially, Medina argues that epistemic justice requires cultivating "epistemic friction"—discomfort prompting questioning of one's assumptions. This concept directly supports epistemic humility in long-term planning: recognizing that our interpretive resources are limited and potentially parochial should constrain optimization-based approaches that assume present frameworks adequately capture all relevant values.

Anderson (2012) shifts epistemic justice from individual virtue ethics to institutional design, arguing that social institutions exhibit epistemic justice or injustice through their testimonial gathering and assessment systems. Institutions that systematically exclude certain voices or fail to design mechanisms correcting for bias instantiate epistemic injustice. This institutional focus is essential for planning contexts where individual epistemic virtues cannot overcome structural biases. If epistemic justice requires institutional design that counteracts bias and includes diverse perspectives, then planning institutions making irreversible decisions about future urban form face distinctive epistemic duties. Such institutions must incorporate mechanisms for recognizing epistemic uncertainty about future values—not merely cultivating better individual epistemic virtues in planners, but creating institutional structures that preserve options precisely because the institution recognizes its epistemic limitations regarding future generations.

Byskov and Hyams (2023) demonstrate how epistemic injustice operates in long-term planning under uncertainty through analysis of climate adaptation policy. They show that adaptation planning systematically marginalizes Indigenous knowledges through testimonial injustice (credibility deficits due to prejudice) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to recognize Indigenous knowledge systems). While their focus is Indigenous knowledge, their framework illuminates how planning institutions systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others. Extended to intergenerational contexts: planning processes that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations. They inherit a world structured by our conceptual schemes without adequate resources to interpret or contest it—they suffer from hermeneutical marginalization we have imposed through irreversible decisions.

Halsband (2022) applies this analysis specifically to AI-supported optimization in long-term planning. She argues that decision-support systems used for climate policy embed controversial assumptions about social discounting and future preferences that significantly influence outcomes. By making these assumptions opaque and treating them as technical rather than normative, AI systems commit hermeneutical injustice: they structure decision-making using frameworks future generations cannot meaningfully interpret or contest. This critique extends directly to urban planning contexts where optimization models increasingly inform decisions about housing density, transportation infrastructure, and spatial development. When such models optimize based on assumptions about future preferences—assumptions necessarily contested given epistemic uncertainty—they impose present hermeneutical frameworks on future generations who inherit but cannot challenge them. Option-preservation approaches that acknowledge epistemic uncertainty may thus be more just than optimization approaches that embed contestable assumptions in technical systems.

### Epistemic Duties as Intergenerational Obligations

The convergence of intergenerational justice theory and epistemic justice frameworks suggests a novel foundation for duties to future generations—one that does not require reciprocity or social relations but grounds obligations in respect for future people's epistemic capacities. Chan (2025) provides a suggestive parallel through her defense of relational egalitarianism against intergenerational objections. She argues we owe future generations not merely resources but the capacity to relate to each other as equals, which requires transforming oppressive social categories (race, gender, class) that structure unequal relations. Failing to transform these categories constitutes a double wrong: unjust relations with contemporaries and wronging future people who inherit oppressive category-structures. The duty extends across non-overlapping generations because social categories persist intergenerationally even when particular relations do not.

Chan's capacity-preservation argument parallels the epistemic duties this section defends. Just as oppressive social categories constrain future people's capacity for equal relations, constraining interpretive frameworks and foreclosing option-sets constrains future people's epistemic capacities—their capacities as knowers. We wrong them epistemically by structuring a world they can interpret only through conceptual schemes we impose, denying them adequate hermeneutical resources to develop alternative interpretations. This epistemic harm does not require that we stand in social relations with them; it arises from our decisions determining their epistemic possibilities.

Applied to urban planning, the argument proceeds: irreversible planning decisions that foreclose options commit epistemic injustice when they constrain future generations' interpretive capacities. If present planning optimizes urban form based on assumptions about future preferences—assumptions necessarily uncertain—this optimization forecloses alternatives future people might have chosen under different interpretive frameworks. By locking in single optimized forms, we impose our hermeneutical frameworks on them, constraining their capacity to interpret and shape their environments according to values we cannot predict. This constitutes hermeneutical injustice: we marginalize them from knowledge-generating practices determining their urban environments, denying them epistemic standing in decisions that will structure their lives.

McCauley et al. (2018) demonstrate the practical relevance of these theoretical concerns through analysis of energy infrastructure decisions. They identify three dimensions of energy justice—distributional (how costs/benefits are allocated), procedural (who participates in decision-making), and recognition (respect for diverse values and knowledge systems)—emphasizing that energy infrastructure is long-lived, capital-intensive, and path-dependent, creating lock-in effects that constrain future options. This framework transfers directly to urban planning, which shares these characteristics. The recognition dimension is especially relevant: if justice requires recognizing diverse values and knowledge systems, this supports preserving options for future generations whose values we cannot adequately represent within present frameworks. When infrastructure decisions (energy or urban) bind future generations through path dependencies, epistemic justice demands preserving interpretive capacity rather than optimizing based on present frameworks.

Green and Brandstedt (2020) strengthen this conclusion through methodological critique. They argue that "principles-first" approaches to climate ethics—deriving action-guidance by applying general principles to empirical facts—are indeterminate under genuine epistemic uncertainty. Such approaches leave open crucial normative choices because they require contestable assumptions about future values that cannot be resolved through philosophical analysis alone. This critique applies to optimization-based planning: under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future preferences, principles-first optimization approaches necessarily embed contested assumptions. Rather than pretending we can derive determinate solutions through philosophical principles, we should acknowledge irreducible normative uncertainty and preserve options precisely because we cannot resolve these normative questions on behalf of future generations.

The fourth failing of standard contractualist frameworks thus becomes clear: they inadequately theorize epistemic duties to future generations under conditions of irreversibility and uncertainty. Standard contractualism emphasizes reciprocity, reasonable agreement, and justification to affected parties—structures that seem unavailable intergenerationally. But epistemic justice provides alternative foundations. We have duties not to constrain future people's epistemic capacities through irreversible decisions made under epistemic uncertainty about their values. These duties do not require that future people reciprocate, participate in agreements, or stand in social relations with us. They arise from recognition that our decisions determine their epistemic possibilities—the hermeneutical frameworks and option-sets available for autonomous interpretation of their circumstances.

For contractualist housing justice, this analysis generates principled constraints on planning authority. When planning decisions about urban form are irreversible—determining density patterns, infrastructure locations, housing configurations that will persist across generations—and when we face epistemic uncertainty about future preferences, contractualist justification requires preserving options rather than optimizing. We cannot justify irreversible optimization to future generations because such optimization necessarily embeds assumptions about their values we cannot know. But we can justify preserving adequate option-sets: this respects their epistemic standing by maintaining interpretive capacity rather than foreclosing it. The contractualist move is not abandoning justification under uncertainty, but recognizing what justification demands—epistemic humility that constrains present authority precisely because we cannot know what future generations will reasonably reject.
