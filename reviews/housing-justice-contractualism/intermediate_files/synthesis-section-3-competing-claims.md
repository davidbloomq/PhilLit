## Section 2: Competing Claims and Structural Tensions

Housing justice debates reveal two fundamental structural tensions that create contractualist impasses: the conflict between incumbent occupancy rights and excluded outsiders' access claims, and housing's contradictory dual role as both affordable necessity and wealth-accumulation asset. These tensions resist resolution through standard contractualist principles because protecting any party's legitimate claims necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of others. The literature documents each tension in detail but rarely frames them as problems of contractualist justification.

### The Occupancy vs. Access Stand-Off

The "occupancy turn" in political philosophy, initiated by Stilz's (2019) reconceptualization of territorial sovereignty, grounds territorial rights in individuals' pre-political interests in remaining where their "located life plans" are anchored rather than collective self-determination alone. This framework powerfully explains incumbent residents' moral claims to place-stability: displacement threatens core autonomy interests by disrupting the spatial arrangements on which people's projects, relationships, and identities depend. Huber and Wolkenstein (2018) extend this logic to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have moral rights not merely against direct displacement but against neighborhood transformation that undermines the "background conditions" enabling their life plans. Their account emphasizes that occupancy rights include participatory governance over neighborhood change, not simply individual residence security.

Recent work has enriched understanding of what makes displacement wrongful beyond property loss. Lloyd (2023) argues that gentrification harms residents through damage to "thriving local communities" even without direct displacement, as neighborhood transformation disrupts social networks, local institutions, and shared practices that constitute community goods. Van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey identifies five philosophical approaches to gentrification ethics—autonomy-based, community-based, equality-based, domination-based, and rights-based—noting field consensus around protecting "place-based" or "located life-plans" as the core concern. Dawkins (2023) emphasizes that for disadvantaged populations, local communities function as crucial support networks, making displacement particularly harmful. Draper (2022) extends occupancy theory to democratic participation, arguing gentrification threatens "everyday democracy" through which residents exercise collective agency over shared spaces.

Critical voices challenge pure occupancy approaches while generally accepting their basic framework. Jenkins (2022) argues that occupancy rights theory focuses too narrowly on located life plans, potentially excluding residents whose connection to place is less plan-structured. His republican framing emphasizes gentrification as domination—arbitrary interference in residents' lives by landlords, developers, and newcomers who can unilaterally transform neighborhoods. Wells (2021) emphasizes expressive dimensions: state-led gentrification sends a message that incumbent residents are less valuable than incoming wealthier populations, threatening self-respect and equal standing beyond material harms. Hoover (2023) situates gentrification within broader patterns of structural injustice, emphasizing how displacement compounds existing injustices faced by marginalized communities through histories of racial segregation and disinvestment.

The literature provides sophisticated resources for understanding incumbent claims but exhibits a systematic blind spot: it focuses overwhelmingly on protection of existing residents with minimal attention to excluded outsiders' access claims. Mancilla (2020) offers rare explicit critique, arguing that Stilz's framework privileges settled, place-attached populations over mobile peoples whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. By protecting only "located" occupancy, the framework allows states to exclude mobile populations, undermining the autonomy rationale occupancy theory claims to serve. Van Leeuwen (2024) confirms this pattern, noting the literature converges on protecting incumbents but systematically neglects newcomer claims or the tension between stability and access.

This creates a contractualist impasse. Occupancy theory establishes that incumbent residents have weighty claims grounded in their located autonomy interests. Yet excluded outsiders also need access to place to pursue their life plans—agglomeration economics demonstrates that location generates irreducible productive value through mechanisms like knowledge spillovers and labor market matching that cannot be replicated elsewhere (a point developed in Section 1). How can principles protecting occupancy be justified to excluded populations who also need access to opportunities concentrated in specific locations? Conversely, how can principles prioritizing access be justified to vulnerable incumbents facing displacement whose autonomy depends on place-stability?

The literature provides no satisfactory answer. Some theorists recognize both sets of claims: Bonotti and Barnhill (2022) note that newcomers develop occupancy interests once settled, complicating simple incumbent-newcomer distinctions, and propose scaling protections by disadvantage level. Kim and Walton (2022) argue advantaged groups relocating to disadvantaged neighborhoods can be permissible if properly regulated to prevent displacement. Yet these approaches remain tentative, neither fully addressing the fundamental tension nor demonstrating how any principle could satisfy contractualist requirements of justifiability to all affected parties. The occupancy literature thus identifies one horn of the dilemma—incumbent protection—while leaving the other horn—access claims—largely untheorized.

### Housing Financialization and the Dual-Role Problem

Housing's transformation into a financialized asset creates a distinct structural contradiction that intensifies contractualist tensions. Fikse and Aalbers (2020) identify what they call the "really big contradiction": financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations because housing's function as wealth store systematically destroys its affordability as necessity. The more housing appreciates to serve as financial asset, the less it can function as affordable social good. This contradiction appears across multiple dimensions of housing policy discourse—affordable homeownership rhetoric coexists with declining affordability reality; conservative finance ideology masks risky lending; asset-based welfare promises clash with unequal wealth distribution; tenure neutrality claims obscure systematic advantages for ownership (Fikse and Aalbers 2020).

The housing-finance feedback cycle emerged from specific policy choices in the 1980s. Ryan-Collins (2019) demonstrates how pro-homeownership policy combined with credit liberalization created a self-reinforcing dynamic: land became the most attractive collateral for banks and the most desirable asset for households, where credit expansion drives house prices, which justifies further lending. This cycle, initially concentrated in Anglo-Saxon economies, has spread globally. The structural necessity for price appreciation to validate lending and household wealth strategies makes affordability increasingly incompatible with the system's operation. Ryan-Collins (2021) traces the historical specificity of this arrangement, showing that private landed property's relationship with finance has varied across contexts—current dynamics are not inevitable but result from particular institutional configurations combining strong homeownership preference with financial liberalization.

Empirical evidence documents the contradiction's consequences for inequality. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics, not income inequality or homeownership rates. The political-institutional determinants of income inequality have no effect on wealth-to-income ratios; instead, rising wealth inequality stems from asset price inflation, particularly housing. This finding reveals that the problem is not ownership per se but price dynamics: housing's function as wealth store depends on appreciation, which directly undermines affordability. The intergenerational dimension is stark—Arundel (2017) shows housing equity is highly concentrated with significant inter- and intra-generational divergences in Britain, with younger cohorts facing especially disadvantaged prospects as housing wealth accumulates among older owner households and secondary property investors.

Dewilde and De Decker (2015) provide systematic comparative evidence that housing financialization increases inequality in housing outcomes, specifically harming low-income households' relative position. Increased financialization correlates with deteriorating affordability for low-income owners and private renters compared to middle-income counterparts, controlling for income trends. Crucially, this trend predates the 2008 financial crisis, appearing already in 1995-2007 data, suggesting structural rather than cyclical dynamics. The finding challenges crisis-centric explanations and indicates that financialization itself—not merely crisis episodes—generates systematic inequality.

Comparative housing systems research reveals how institutional design shapes whether the dual-role tension is tractable. Kemeny's (1981) foundational distinction between dualist and unitary housing systems remains influential: dualist systems residualize social rental so it competes with homeownership, making ownership the primary path to housing security; unitary systems maintain robust non-profit and private rental sectors competing with each other, with homeownership less dominant. Kemeny argued homeownership ideology serves class interests by privatizing housing security while reducing pressure for comprehensive welfare provision—the "really big trade-off" between homeownership and welfare. Recent work confirms this typology's relevance: Kohl and Sørvoll (2021) explain divergence between Nordic countries (moving toward high homeownership, mortgage debt, and price increases) and German-speaking countries (maintaining lower homeownership, stronger tenancy, lower indebtedness, stable prices) through differential social-democratic ideologies and cooperative traditions dating to the 1920s.

Christophers (2019) provides crucial normative framing by arguing tenure inequality—ideological and economic inequality between ownership and rental—is the root cause of asset-based inequality. When ownership is systematically privileged over rental through subsidies, ideology, and policy, housing's asset function necessarily creates inequality because only owners access wealth accumulation while renters face affordability pressures without wealth benefits. He argues reinstating tenure equality principles should be the primary policy objective to reduce property asset inequalities and prevent intergenerational reproduction. This analysis suggests the dual-role problem may be policy-constructed rather than inevitable: different institutional arrangements could prevent housing's transformation into wealth accumulation vehicle.

Yet even strong welfare states struggle to prevent this transformation. Benites-Gambirazio and Bonneval (2022) show France—despite its robust social welfare tradition—developed a distinct Housing Asset-Based Welfare regime through pro-homeownership policies since the 1970s combined with welfare retrenchment and pension reforms from the 1990s. France exemplifies how asset-based welfare can emerge across welfare regime types, not merely in Anglo-Saxon contexts. This complicates reform possibilities: if financialization occurs even where strong social protections exist, institutional alternatives may be more constrained than tenure equality advocates suggest.

The dual-role contradiction creates a contractualist impasse structurally parallel to the occupancy/access deadlock. Housing appreciation cannot be justified to excluded newcomers for whom rising prices mean unaffordable access to opportunity. Yet price suppression cannot be justified to incumbent owner-occupiers whose housing is their primary asset and source of economic security. Policies enabling one group's legitimate claims necessarily violate the other group's equally legitimate claims. The contradiction is structural: under financialized conditions where housing serves as the primary wealth store for most households, any housing price policy fails contractualist reasonable acceptance requirements.

### Property-Owning Democracy and Housing's Dual Role

Property-owning democracy offers a potential resolution to wealth concentration problems, yet its application to housing reveals fundamental tensions. The POD framework, developed by Rawls and elaborated by O'Neill and Williamson (2012), Freeman (2013, 2018), and Thomas (2016), proposes dispersed capital ownership as alternative to welfare-state capitalism. POD aims to prevent domination and secure fair equality of opportunity through predistributive institutions that disperse ownership rather than redistributive transfers that leave ownership concentrated. Freeman (2018) emphasizes that POD is fundamentally about democratic reciprocity and self-respect—arrangements must be mutually justifiable among free and equal citizens, not merely produce particular distributional patterns.

Applied to housing, POD appears to favor dispersed homeownership as mechanism for distributing wealth and preventing domination. Erck (2024) develops "housing limitarianism" within a POD framework, arguing for wealth ceilings on housing ownership to disperse property throughout society. Her approach addresses quantity of housing owned—preventing individuals and corporations from acquiring excess homes while others lack adequate housing. Yet Erck does not address the core tension this research identifies: whether POD can justify housing price dynamics to affected parties. Even if ownership is widely dispersed, housing appreciation enriches current owners while excluding newcomers through unaffordability. Conversely, price suppression attacks incumbent owners' asset security that POD aims to provide.

Gregory (2016) provides trenchant critique of homeownership-based POD, arguing it creates anti-egalitarian dynamics rather than dispersing wealth. Examining UK and US contexts, he distinguishes conservative interpretations linking homeownership to virtuous citizenship and small-state ideology from subordinate egalitarian interpretations seeking solidarity through broader property ownership. Gregory contends the egalitarian reinterpretation is "politically and sociologically naïve"—homeownership-based POD generates anti-welfare politics as homeowners become a constituency defending asset values against redistributive policies. Historical analysis reveals this pattern: Jackson (2012) traces how "property-owning democracy" rhetoric has been periodically revived and redefined, with Margaret Thatcher's 1980s interpretation emphasizing homeownership expansion in explicitly anti-welfare terms.

The justifiability problem deepens when considering POD's core values. If POD requires arrangements supporting self-respect and reciprocity among citizens (Freeman 2018), housing policies that enrich some through appreciation while excluding others fail this test. Lister (2017) defends POD against welfarist critiques by arguing the difference principle should not require the present worst-off to accept inequality that doesn't benefit them for the sake of future generations who will be better off anyway. This time-indexed fairness requirement has direct implications: we cannot require current non-owners to accept unaffordable housing enabling incumbent owners' wealth accumulation on grounds that future policies will help future worst-off. Similarly, suppressing housing values to help current non-owners attacks the self-respect of those whose main asset is their home—the very concern POD prioritizes.

Thomas's (2016) synthesis of neo-republican political theory with Rawlsian justice emphasizes that POD structures economic incentives to make domination structurally impossible in markets. Yet housing's dual role creates domination in either direction: if housing appreciates, newcomers are dominated by being excluded from opportunity through unaffordability; if prices are suppressed, incumbent owners are dominated by policies that attack their primary source of security. White (2016) explores connections between republicanism and POD through non-domination, but applying this to housing reveals the structural bind: dispersed homeownership creates domination when prices fluctuate, yet preventing fluctuation requires controls that themselves constitute domination of property owners.

Halliday and Meyer's (2024) comprehensive survey of housing justice philosophy identifies this gap, arguing the field has given insufficient attention to macroeconomic dimensions of housing, particularly price dynamics and wealth accumulation via homeownership. They advocate for normative approaches beyond human flourishing and relational equality frameworks that can address distributive concerns directly—an opening for contractualist analysis. Yet their survey reveals no existing work that successfully resolves the dual-role problem or demonstrates how POD principles could justify either appreciation or suppression to all affected parties.

The contractualist critique exposes fundamental limits: housing's dual role under financialized conditions makes it impossible to satisfy reasonable acceptance requirements for all parties. POD's commitment to dispersed ownership as mechanism for preventing domination and securing reciprocity cannot be realized through housing when housing must simultaneously serve as affordable necessity and wealth store. Neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies contractualist standards, revealing a principled impasse rather than merely an implementation challenge. The dual-role problem thus represents not a gap in POD's application to housing but a domain where POD's justificatory requirements cannot be met.

**Section Summary**

These structural tensions—occupancy versus access, necessity versus asset—create contractualist deadlocks where protecting legitimate claims of some parties necessarily violates equally legitimate claims of others. The occupancy rights literature establishes robust grounds for incumbent protection but systematically neglects excluded outsiders who also need access to pursue life plans. Housing financialization transforms housing into the primary wealth accumulation mechanism for most households, creating a contradiction where appreciation serves owners but excludes newcomers while suppression helps affordability but attacks incumbent security. Property-owning democracy, when applied to housing, faces justifiability problems in both directions: neither price appreciation nor suppression can satisfy contractualist reasonable acceptance requirements for all affected parties.

Standard contractualist frameworks lack resources to resolve these tensions because they presume goods are commensurable and principles can be reciprocally justified to all affected parties. Housing violates both presumptions: location generates non-fungible value (Section 1), and structural contradictions create zero-sum conflicts where satisfying one party's claims requires violating another's. The literature documents each tension in rich detail but rarely frames them as contractualist problems requiring mutual justifiability. This framing reveals that housing justice may require distinctive theoretical treatment beyond general distributive principles—a theme developed further through intergenerational and epistemic dimensions in Section 3.
