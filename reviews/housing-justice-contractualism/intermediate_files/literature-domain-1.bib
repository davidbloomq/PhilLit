====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers the core framework of contractualist moral and political philosophy, particularly Rawlsian contractualism and Scanlonian contractualism. The central debate concerns the structure and requirements of justification in political arrangements. Rawls's framework centers on the original position, the veil of ignorance, and the two principles of justice—equal basic liberties and the difference principle. His account of primary goods as the metric for distributive justice establishes a "thin theory of the good" that aims to be neutral among reasonable conceptions of the good life. Scanlon's contractualism, by contrast, focuses on interpersonal moral obligations grounded in reasonable rejectability—an act is wrong if it violates principles no one could reasonably reject. Recent work has explored tensions between these accounts, particularly regarding aggregation, the scope of moral concern, and the adequate ground for distributive requirements.

Key debates include: (1) whether contractualist frameworks adequately ground distributive justice or merely procedural constraints; (2) the relationship between Rawls's political constructivism and Scanlon's moral contractualism; (3) whether the thin theory of primary goods sufficiently captures what citizens need to pursue their life plans; and (4) how contractualist principles apply to non-ideal circumstances, including state coercion and non-voluntary participation in social cooperation.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational to the housing-justice research project because it establishes the justifiability requirements for state coercion. The project's critique of Rawlsian contractualism on housing requires understanding: (1) how primary goods abstract from particular attachments like place; (2) what counts as a justifiable inequality under the difference principle; (3) when thin theories fail to resolve substantive policy questions; and (4) the limits of hypothetical consent in legitimating actual coercion over housing and land.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature on contractualism and housing/land is surprisingly sparse. Most applications focus on healthcare, global justice, or abstract distributive principles. There is minimal engagement with contractualist justifications for property regimes, land use regulation, or housing policy—precisely the domains where state coercion is most direct and affects fundamental interests in place and stability.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish between Rawlsian political contractualism (focused on basic structure) and Scanlonian moral contractualism (focused on interpersonal obligations). It should also trace how the primary goods framework abstracts from particular goods like housing and place-attachment, setting up the project's critique of this fungibility assumption.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Rawlsian Justice as Fairness: 8 papers - Original position, primary goods, difference principle
- Scanlonian Reasonable Rejection: 5 papers - Interpersonal justifiability, reasonable rejectability
- Critics of Thin Theories: 5 papers - Capabilities approach, limits of abstraction

@book{rawls1971theory,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {A Theory of Justice},
  year = {1971},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  isbn = {9780674000780},
  doi = {10.4159/9780674042605},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls presents justice as fairness, arguing that principles of justice should be chosen from behind a "veil of ignorance" in an "original position" where parties do not know their particular circumstances. From this position, rational agents would choose two principles: (1) equal basic liberties for all, and (2) inequalities are permissible only if they benefit the least advantaged (difference principle) and are attached to positions open under fair equality of opportunity. The theory uses "primary goods"—rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, and self-respect—as the metric for distributive justice, assuming these goods are valuable whatever one's conception of the good life.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for the research project. The housing-justice critique challenges several Rawlsian assumptions: (1) that primary goods like income and wealth are fungible and interchangeable; (2) that the framework adequately captures non-fungible goods like stable housing and place-attachment; (3) that the thin theory of the good can resolve questions about housing as necessity versus asset; and (4) that the hypothetical consent of the original position legitimates actual coercion over housing and land. Rawls's account establishes the contractualist baseline the project critiques.

  POSITION: Foundational Rawlsian contractualism; establishes primary goods framework and difference principle as core distributive requirements.

@book{rawls1993political,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {Political Liberalism},
  year = {1993},
  publisher = {Columbia University Press},
  address = {New York},
  isbn = {9780231130882},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls revises his theory of justice to address the fact of reasonable pluralism in democratic societies. He argues that justice as fairness should be understood as a "political" rather than "comprehensive" doctrine—it does not depend on any particular conception of the good life. The legitimacy of political power requires that it be exercisable in accordance with principles all reasonable citizens could endorse through "public reason." This work introduces the idea of an "overlapping consensus" among reasonable comprehensive doctrines and clarifies that primary goods are specified for free and equal citizens cooperating in a well-ordered society.

  RELEVANCE: This text is crucial for understanding the scope and limits of contractualist justification. The housing-justice project engages with Rawls's claim that primary goods are "neutral" and can command overlapping consensus. The critique argues that seemingly neutral principles about housing fungibility actually presuppose contestable views about attachment, stability, and the good life—views that particular communities (e.g., those facing displacement) could reasonably reject. Political Liberalism also clarifies the "burdens of judgment" that explain reasonable disagreement, which the project applies to disagreements about housing policy.

  POSITION: Refined Rawlsian political constructivism; shifts from comprehensive to political doctrine; emphasizes public reason and overlapping consensus.

@book{scanlon1998owe,
  author = {Scanlon, Thomas M.},
  title = {What We Owe to Each Other},
  year = {1998},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  isbn = {9780674004238},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon develops a contractualist moral theory distinct from Rawls's political theory. An act is wrong if it would be disallowed by principles that no one could reasonably reject, insofar as they are motivated to find principles for mutual recognition and governance. "Reasonable rejection" is the core concept: to determine what principles govern our conduct toward each other, we must ask what objections individuals could raise to proposed principles given their particular circumstances and burdens. Unlike Rawls's hypothetical contract, Scanlon's contractualism is a substantive claim about the basis of interpersonal moral obligation—wrongness consists in treating others in ways not justifiable to them.

  RELEVANCE: Scanlon's framework provides an alternative contractualist approach that may better address the housing-justice project's concerns. His emphasis on justifiability to each particular person (rather than generic rational choosers behind a veil) suggests that policies affecting housing and place-attachment must be justifiable to those actually burdened—not merely to hypothetical agents ignorant of their attachments. The project can draw on Scanlon's account of reasonable rejection to argue that housing policies treating occupancy as fungible with financial compensation fail to respect what individuals in particular circumstances could reasonably object to. However, Scanlon's framework raises questions about scope: does it ground requirements of distributive justice or only interpersonal moral obligations?

  POSITION: Scanlonian moral contractualism; emphasizes reasonable rejectability and interpersonal justification; distinct from Rawls's political contractualism.

  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  pages = {34--59},
  doi = {10.1093/OXFORDHB/9780199645121.013.2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Freeman provides the authoritative analysis of Rawls's difference principle, clarifying its requirements and scope. He explains that the difference principle requires economic systems to be organized so the least advantaged are better off than in any alternative arrangement. Freeman distinguishes the principle's "broad" requirements (institutional framework) from "narrow" requirements (specific policies), and argues it is a reciprocity principle—not a prioritarian principle focused solely on the worst off. He also defends "property-owning democracy" over welfare-state capitalism as better satisfying Rawls's principles, because it prevents massive inequalities in wealth that undermine fair value of political liberties and fair equality of opportunity.

  RELEVANCE: Freeman's analysis is essential for understanding what the difference principle requires regarding housing and property. The housing-justice project can draw on Freeman's distinction between broad and narrow requirements to argue that housing policy sits at the institutional level where the difference principle directly applies. His discussion of property-owning democracy versus welfare-state capitalism illuminates how property regimes affect distributive justice. The project critiques whether treating housing as just another primary good (fungible with income/wealth) truly maximizes the position of the least advantaged when considering stability, community, and place-attachment—dimensions Freeman's analysis does not address.

  POSITION: Contemporary Rawlsian scholarship; defends difference principle as reciprocity principle; advocates property-owning democracy.

@article{miller2021sidgwick,
  author = {Miller, David},
  title = {Sidgwick and Rawls on Distributive Justice and Desert},
  journal = {Politics, Philosophy \& Economics},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {20},
  number = {4},
  pages = {385--408},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X211036088},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller critically examines Rawls's rejection of desert as a principle of distributive justice, comparing it to Sidgwick's parallel move. He argues that both philosophers' anti-desert arguments rest on contestable conceptual or metaphysical claims that conflict with their methodological commitments to reflective equilibrium and common-sense convictions. Miller distinguishes three levels of anti-desert arguments: (1) fundamental defects in the concept of desert; (2) inability to find a coherent basis for desert; (3) institutional impossibility of rewarding desert. He finds all these arguments unsound and suggests Rawls's substitute principles (legitimate entitlement under just institutions) capture only part of what desert conveys and may not adequately address popular convictions about justice.

  RELEVANCE: This article is relevant because the housing-justice project's critique of fungibility implicitly appeals to something like desert or earned entitlement to place and stability—attachments that arise through occupancy and community participation. Miller's analysis suggests that Rawls's framework may inadequately account for intuitions about what people deserve based on their actual choices and contributions. The project can use this analysis to argue that treating housing as fungible (exchangeable for money) ignores legitimate bases for attachment that arise from occupancy—bases that contractualism should recognize even if they don't fit the primary goods framework.

  POSITION: Critical of Rawls's rejection of desert; argues common-sense convictions support desert-based considerations in distributive justice.

@article{andersson2022distributive,

  title = {Distributive Justice, Social Cooperation, and the Basis of Equality},
  journal = {Theoria},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {88},
  number = {6},
  pages = {1375--1391},
  doi = {10.1111/theo.12433},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andersson defends Rawls's account of moral personality as the basis of equality in distributive justice against common criticisms. He argues that critics fail to appreciate that Rawls's account is specifically restricted to the domain of distributive justice, understood as the fair terms of cooperation among participants in a system of social cooperation. On this view, distributive justice concerns not all moral relations but specifically the division of benefits and burdens of social cooperation. Andersson contends that this domain-specific understanding provides a compelling rationale for moral personality (the capacity for a sense of justice and conception of the good) as the basis of equal standing, because varying natural capacities beyond this threshold are morally arbitrary for determining fair terms of cooperation.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the scope and basis of Rawlsian distributive justice, which is crucial for the housing-justice project. If distributive justice specifically concerns fair terms of social cooperation, the question becomes: what role do housing and land play in the cooperative scheme? The project can use Andersson's analysis to ask whether treating housing as fungible respects equal moral personality or instead privileges those with liquid assets over those whose "primary goods" are tied up in place and community. The social cooperation frame also raises questions about how to treat those who don't voluntarily participate in housing markets but face coercion (eminent domain, displacement).

  POSITION: Defends Rawlsian equality basis; emphasizes moral personality and social cooperation framework for distributive justice.

@article{stensen2022envy,

  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {23},
  number = {2},
  pages = {320--339},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851221125572},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stensen argues against the conventional view that envy should have no role in distributive justice. Drawing on Rawls's and Honneth's concerns about the social bases of self-esteem/self-respect, he contends that certain forms of envy involve harms to self-esteem that a just society should prevent. Stensen distinguishes between irrational malicious envy and rational envy regarding opportunities for social esteem, arguing that preventing the latter is consistent with commitments to protecting self-respect. He defends envy-avoidance against three objections: that envy is always irrational, that preventing it is unfair, and that it is unreasonable to accommodate due to envy's antisocial nature.

  RELEVANCE: This article is highly relevant to housing-justice arguments about dignity and self-respect. Rawls identifies self-respect as "perhaps the most important primary good," yet the primary goods framework may inadequately protect it when housing instability or displacement undermine individuals' sense of standing in the community. Stensen's analysis supports examining how housing policies affect self-esteem and social bases of self-respect—dimensions that monetary compensation may fail to restore. The project can argue that treating housing as fungible with money ignores how housing stability supports self-respect through community membership, a concern Rawls's framework should accommodate but inadequately operationalizes.

  POSITION: Extends Rawlsian concerns about self-respect; argues envy-avoidance is relevant to distributive justice when envy harms self-esteem.

@article{pettit2012legitimacy,

  volume = {65},
  number = {1},
  pages = {59--82},
  doi = {10.1093/clp/cus016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pettit distinguishes legitimacy (how coercion is imposed) from justice (what social order is imposed) and argues legitimacy is a distinct concern requiring its own justification. The core legitimacy question is showing how state coercion is consistent with people being free citizens. Pettit rejects social contract theories that ground legitimacy in actual or hypothetical consensus, arguing instead that republican freedom as non-domination provides the key. State coercion is legitimate when it does not dominate—when it is controlled by those subject to it through contestatory democratic institutions. This legitimacy does not require showing the state exists by contract, only that its power is non-arbitrary.

  RELEVANCE: Pettit's account is crucial for the housing-justice project's critique of contractualist justifications for coercion. If legitimacy and justice are distinct, hypothetical consent in the original position may not legitimate actual state coercion over housing and land—even if that coercion serves distributive justice. The project can use Pettit's framework to argue that housing policies (eminent domain, zoning, displacement) require contestatory justification to actual affected parties, not merely conformity to principles that hypothetical agents would choose. His republican emphasis on non-domination also suggests examining whether housing policies create arbitrary power relations that primary goods frameworks fail to capture.

  editor = {Sen, Amartya and Williams, Bernard},
  year = {1982},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  pages = {103--128},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon introduces his contractualist moral theory as an alternative to utilitarianism. He argues that thinking about right and wrong is fundamentally about what we can justify to others on grounds they could not reasonably reject. This contrasts with utilitarian aggregation of individual well-being. Contractualism respects the "separateness of persons" by requiring that principles be justifiable to each person affected, not merely maximize overall welfare. Scanlon distinguishes his view from social contract theories focused on mutual advantage and self-interest (Hobbes, Gauthier), emphasizing instead the moral motivation to justify oneself to others.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational essay establishes key themes Scanlon later develops in What We Owe to Each Other. For the housing-justice project, it introduces the "reasonable rejection" criterion that offers an alternative to Rawls's original position. Housing policies that treat occupancy as fungible with compensation might be reasonably rejectable by those whose attachments to place and community are disrupted—even if such policies satisfy the difference principle. The essay's emphasis on justification to each person (versus aggregation or hypothetical choice) provides conceptual resources for the project's critique of treating diverse goods as commensurable.

  volume = {110},
  number = {4},
  pages = {563--586},
  doi = {10.1215/00318108-110-4-563},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Adams provides a sympathetic but critical assessment of Scanlon's contractualism. He praises Scanlon's development of a comprehensive theory that takes individual interests fairly into account while rejecting aggregative consequentialism. Adams examines Scanlon's account of wrongness in terms of reasonable rejectability and explores how Scanlon's theory handles cases of conflicting interests. He raises questions about the scope of contractualist moral reasoning—whether it captures all of morality or only what we owe to each other—and about how to determine what counts as a reasonable rejection versus an unreasonable demand.

  RELEVANCE: Adams's critical notice illuminates both strengths and limitations of Scanlonian contractualism for the housing-justice project. His discussion of scope is particularly relevant: if contractualism concerns only interpersonal moral obligations, does it ground requirements of distributive justice (including housing rights)? Or must distributive justice rest on a different foundation (like Rawls's political contractualism)? Adams's analysis of reasonable rejection criteria is also important for determining when housing policies that treat place-attachment as tradeable could be reasonably rejected—and what standards govern this determination.

  number = {2},
  pages = {243--291},
  doi = {10.1007/S11098-005-2216-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reidy examines how Rawlsian political liberalism handles reasonable disagreement and develops an account of democratic legitimacy based on reciprocity. He argues that political power is legitimate when exercised according to principles all reasonable citizens could reciprocally endorse through public reason, despite their reasonable disagreements about comprehensive doctrines. Reidy analyzes the structure of reasonable disagreement, the duty of civility, and how democratic procedures can produce legitimate outcomes even when citizens reasonably disagree about justice. He emphasizes that reciprocity requires more than mutual advantage—it requires respecting others as free and equal moral persons.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the justificatory structure of Rawlsian contractualism and its handling of reasonable pluralism, which is crucial for housing-justice arguments. The project engages with how seemingly neutral principles about housing fungibility actually presuppose contestable comprehensive views. Reidy's analysis of reciprocity and reasonable disagreement helps frame the question: could reasonable citizens reject principles treating housing as fungible, given reasonable disagreements about place-attachment, community stability, and the good life? His emphasis on reciprocity among equals (not mere mutual advantage) also supports examining whether housing policies respect moral equality or instead privilege mobile over rooted citizens.

  number = {3},
  pages = {283--304},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X030023001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wenar applies Scanlonian contractualism to questions of global justice and duties to distant strangers. He argues that while Scanlon's framework successfully grounds strong duties of non-harm and rescue to identifiable individuals, it faces difficulties grounding positive duties of assistance to statistical lives and addressing structural injustice. Wenar examines whether contractualist principles can be extended beyond face-to-face interpersonal contexts to global institutional arrangements, comparing Scanlon's approach with Rawlsian and cosmopolitan alternatives. He suggests that contractualism's emphasis on justifiability to each person may require supplementation for questions of distributive justice at scale.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on global justice, Wenar's analysis illuminates broader questions about contractualism's scope and grounding for distributive requirements. The housing-justice project faces parallel challenges: if contractualism grounds interpersonal moral obligations, does it also ground institutional requirements regarding housing distribution? Or must housing justice rely on different (perhaps Rawlsian political) foundations? Wenar's discussion of structural versus interpersonal injustice is relevant because housing policy operates at both levels—individual displacement decisions and systemic property regimes—and contractualism may handle these differently.

  volume = {109},
  number = {4},
  pages = {766--779},
  doi = {10.1017/s0003055415000490},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Valentini develops a "social samaritan" theory distinguishing when duties to assist the needy are enforceable demands of justice versus non-enforceable beneficence. She rejects the common view that bodily service provision is non-enforceable while resource transfers are enforceable. Instead, she argues that within political communities, duties to help the needy—whether via services or resources—are always enforceable justice demands except when the needy are reckless; across independent communities, they are always beneficence. She defends this alternative double standard based on shared social cooperation within but not across political communities.

  RELEVANCE: Valentini's framework is valuable for examining when and why housing assistance might be an enforceable right rather than discretionary policy. If citizens have enforceable justice-based claims to assistance within their political community, this might ground rights to stable housing as part of what co-citizens owe each other. The social cooperation framework also connects to Rawlsian themes: if housing is essential for participating in social cooperation, contractualist principles should ensure its adequate provision. However, the project may critique whether this adequately captures duties regarding housing when the "needy" arise from unjust displacement rather than bad luck.

  POSITION: Social samaritan theory; distinguishes enforceable justice from beneficence based on shared political community and social cooperation.

  doi = {10.1111/j.1747-9991.2009.00254.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Southwood provides a critical introduction to contractualism as a moral theory, focusing specifically on Scanlon's Kantian version. He elucidates four key features: (1) justifiability to others as the foundation of moral rightness and wrongness; (2) reasonable rejectability as the criterion for determining which principles are justifiable; (3) the individualist restriction—principles must be justifiable to each person affected, not merely promote overall good; and (4) mutual recognition—the moral motivation is a desire to relate to others on terms of mutual respect. Southwood also surveys major challenges to contractualism, including the scope problem, aggregation difficulties, and circularity objections.

  RELEVANCE: This overview article is valuable for situating the housing-justice project's use of contractualist frameworks. It clarifies the distinction between moral contractualism (Scanlon) and political contractualism (Rawls), which the project must navigate when applying contractualist principles to housing policy. Southwood's discussion of the individualist restriction is particularly relevant: housing policies affecting place-attachment and community must be justifiable to each affected person, not merely promote aggregate welfare or satisfy hypothetical contractors. The overview also flags key challenges—scope, aggregation, circularity—that the project must address when applying contractualism to housing questions.

  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  pages = {65--81},
  doi = {10.1515/mopp-2018-0057},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Giubilini and Savulescu examine when public health policies can justifiably require individuals to make personal sacrifices for community benefit. Drawing on demandingness objections in moral philosophy, they argue that states should primarily require actions individuals have independent moral obligations to perform, making coercive measures ethically justified especially when interventions also benefit the individuals. When policies require overly demanding sacrifices beyond moral obligation, states must provide incentives or compensation. They apply this framework to vaccination, antimicrobial resistance, and quarantine/isolation policies, arguing different policies demand different justificatory structures based on their burden on individuals.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on public health, this framework directly applies to housing and land use coercion. The housing-justice project can use the demandingness analysis to ask: when housing policies (eminent domain, exclusionary zoning, displacement) impose severe burdens on individuals for alleged community benefit, what justification is required? Do individuals have independent moral obligations to accept such burdens? If not, compensation or consent may be required. The article's emphasis on individual burden rather than aggregate utility aligns with contractualist individualist restrictions and provides tools for assessing when housing coercion exceeds legitimate demands.

  pages = {78--85},
  doi = {10.1136/medethics-2020-106821},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Savulescu develops an ethical algorithm for justified mandatory vaccination, arguing it can be defended when: (1) public health threat is grave; (2) safety/effectiveness confidence is high; (3) expected utility exceeds alternatives; and (4) penalties are proportionate. He proposes that under risk conditions, payment for vaccination may be ethically superior to mandates. Savulescu defends payment systems against objections that they constitute coercion or undermine solidarity, arguing payment can be cash or in-kind and preserves opportunity for altruistic choice. The analysis distinguishes genuine coercion from incentivization and examines when bodily autonomy can be overridden for public benefit.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides a detailed framework for assessing when state coercion is justified, which directly parallels the housing-justice project's concerns. Just as vaccination mandates raise questions about justified coercion over bodies, housing policies raise questions about justified coercion over place and property. Savulescu's proportionality analysis and compensation framework can be adapted: if housing coercion (eminent domain, displacement) is deemed necessary for public benefit, what compensation is required? The article's distinction between coercion and incentivization is also relevant for examining housing policies that "encourage" mobility through market mechanisms.

  journal = {Journal of Philosophy},
  year = {1980},
  volume = {77},
  number = {9},
  pages = {515--572},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls articulates his method of "Kantian constructivism," distinguishing it from both moral realism and radical relativism. The constructivist procedure uses the original position to model reasonable constraints on principles of justice, where principles are constructed through rational choice under specified conditions rather than discovered as independent moral facts. Rawls explains how his approach is "Kantian" in treating persons as free and equal moral persons with the capacity for a conception of the good and a sense of justice. He clarifies that primary goods are specified as what free and equal persons need as citizens, not simply as means to any ends, and argues this construction procedure yields objective practical truth within the domain of justice.

  RELEVANCE: This essay is foundational for understanding Rawls's contractualist methodology and its limitations. The housing-justice project engages with Rawls's constructivism by asking whether the constructed principles adequately account for goods like housing that resist the fungibility assumptions of primary goods. Rawls's specification of citizens as free and equal may presuppose a mobility and detachment from place that not all reasonable citizens share. The project can question whether the constructivist procedure—which abstracts from particular attachments in the original position—can adequately handle housing questions where particular attachments (to place, community, stability) are precisely what's at stake.

  POSITION: Methodological essay; articulates Kantian constructivism; explains primary goods and objectivity in justice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon provides a concise summary of his contractualist moral theory from What We Owe to Each Other. He reiterates that an action is wrong if it violates principles no one could reasonably reject, motivated by the aim of finding principles for mutual recognition. He emphasizes that contractualism offers an account of the nature of moral wrongness (not merely a decision procedure) and that reasonable rejectability is not reducible to other moral notions. Scanlon also clarifies how his view differs from Rawls's political contractualism—Scanlon's theory is about interpersonal morality whereas Rawls addresses political justice.

  RELEVANCE: This précis efficiently summarizes key commitments of Scanlonian contractualism that the housing-justice project engages with. The distinction from Rawls is particularly important: if Scanlon's framework governs interpersonal obligations while Rawls's governs political structure, which framework applies to housing policy? Housing operates at both levels—interpersonal (landlord-tenant, neighbor relations) and political (zoning, eminent domain, property law). The project must navigate this scope question when applying contractualist principles to housing coercion, potentially arguing that adequate housing policy requires coordination between both frameworks.

  POSITION: Concise restatement of Scanlonian contractualism; clarifies distinction from Rawlsian political contractualism.
