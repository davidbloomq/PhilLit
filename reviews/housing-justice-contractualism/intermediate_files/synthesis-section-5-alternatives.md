## Section 4: Alternative Normative Frameworks

Having established housing's distinctive features—non-fungible locational value, competing legitimate claims creating structural deadlocks, and intergenerational epistemic duties—we must position contractualism against alternative normative approaches. Rights-based frameworks, capabilities theories, and relational egalitarianism each offer resources for housing justice, and each faces distinctive challenges. Understanding these alternatives clarifies what contractualist approaches must explain that competing frameworks cannot, and where contractualism may require integration with these approaches. This section surveys the three major alternatives, emphasizing their analytical strengths and identifying where they leave gaps that motivate contractualist treatment.

### 4.1 Rights-Based Approaches

Rights-based frameworks ground housing claims in dignity, autonomy, or basic needs, offering strong normative protections independent of social welfare calculations. Wells (2019) develops perhaps the most sophisticated recent defense of housing rights, arguing for a positive right to exercise "lease rights" over a self-contained living space of adequate standard for a minimum of three years. Crucially, Wells argues this is a right to autonomous dwelling—not merely shelter—emphasizing stable, private housing that individuals control. Her account grounds housing rights in individual autonomy: having one's own dwelling space is constitutive of the conditions for autonomous agency, not merely instrumentally valuable. Wells explicitly defends this as a right to live alone; communal housing imposed by resource scarcity violates basic rights even if it provides adequate shelter. The temporal dimension (minimum three years) recognizes that housing's value depends on stability—short-term shelter fails to provide the conditions for autonomous life-planning that ground the right.

Shue's (2020) updated edition of *Basic Rights* provides broader theoretical foundations, arguing that subsistence rights including adequate housing are "morally basic" because their enjoyment is essential to enjoying all other rights. Subsistence rights stand alongside security and liberty as foundational: without adequate housing, individuals cannot effectively exercise political, economic, or social rights. Shue's framework makes housing rights conceptually prior to other distributive concerns—they are not outcomes of optimization over competing claims but preconditions for participation in social and political life. The 40th anniversary edition includes new material on climate change progressively undermining subsistence bases, adding urgency to housing rights claims. As climate impacts displace populations and destroy housing stock, basic rights frameworks provide moral foundations for protection and relocation obligations.

Essert (2016) addresses the relationship between property institutions and homelessness, arguing that private property systems that fail to ensure everyone has access to shelter are morally deficient. His analysis focuses on what justifies the state's enforcement of property rights against those experiencing homelessness. The state may legitimately exclude homeless persons from private property only if genuine alternative shelter is available. Property rights, on Essert's account, carry correlative obligations: a property regime is justified only insofar as it ensures basic shelter access for all. This connects property theory to housing justice by making adequate housing provision a condition for legitimate property institutions.

Rights-based approaches offer several advantages. They provide strong moral protections that resist consequentialist trade-offs—basic rights are not negotiable against aggregate welfare gains. They ground housing claims in fundamental values (dignity, autonomy, subsistence) that command broad recognition across liberal democratic societies. And they offer clear action-guidance: rights generate correlative duties specifying what states and individuals owe to others. Wells's emphasis on autonomous dwelling rather than mere shelter, for instance, provides specific content about housing quality and security that generic "right to housing" claims lack.

However, rights frameworks face three persistent challenges. First, **content specification**: how much housing, of what quality, in what locations does the right entail? Wells addresses this through the autonomous dwelling standard (self-contained, private, adequate, three years minimum), but questions remain about whether location matters. Does the right to housing entail a right to live in high-opportunity areas, or may the state satisfy the right by providing adequate housing in low-opportunity locations? If location generates non-fungible value through agglomeration mechanisms (as Section 1 established), then treating housing rights as location-neutral may systematically disadvantage rights-holders by excluding them from productive regions. But if rights extend to high-opportunity locations, how should we adjudicate competing claims when housing supply is constrained?

Second, **trade-offs and rights conflicts**: housing rights inevitably conflict with other rights—property rights of current owners, development rights, mobility rights, environmental preservation. Rights frameworks struggle to specify how such conflicts should be resolved without introducing consequentialist balancing that undermines rights' non-negotiable status. Erck's (2024) housing limitarianism—arguing it is morally wrong to own excess housing while others lack adequate housing—illustrates this tension. If governments should limit excessive housing acquisition to ensure adequate housing for all, this restricts property rights to protect housing rights. Rights-based frameworks must either accept lexical priority orderings (which seem implausible given value pluralism) or introduce balancing procedures that threaten to collapse rights into flexible interests.

Third, **institutional design and feasibility**: rights generate obligations, but specifying who bears correlative duties and through what institutions remains contested. Does the housing right entail obligations on governments to provide housing directly, to regulate markets to ensure affordability, or merely to refrain from interference with housing access? Essert's focus on property institutions points toward systemic analysis, but rights frameworks generally remain underspecified about institutional arrangements. As Halliday and Meyer (2024) note, philosophical housing literature has inadequately engaged with macroeconomic policy dimensions—fiscal policy, monetary policy, credit markets—that shape housing access. Rights-based approaches may identify what is owed without explaining how institutions should deliver it.

### 4.2 Capabilities and Conversion Factors

Capabilities approaches shift focus from resources or rights to what people are actually able to do and be—their functionings and freedoms. Kimhur (2024) develops the most systematic recent capabilities approach to housing, proposing evaluation through three dimensions: housing opportunities (real options for choosing housing), housing securities (stability and protection), and housing abilities (capacities to maintain and improve housing situations). This framework emphasizes changes in people's capabilities for valued ways of residing rather than distributional patterns of housing units or resources. Housing justice, on Kimhur's account, requires expanding the capabilities people have regarding housing, not merely providing housing units or equalizing housing consumption.

The capabilities approach offers several advantages over resource-based frameworks. It recognizes that the same housing resources generate different capabilities depending on personal characteristics and social contexts—what Sen (1985) calls "conversion factors." Location serves as a crucial environmental conversion factor: identical housing units generate radically different capabilities depending on whether they are located in high-opportunity or low-opportunity regions. A dwelling in a productive agglomeration provides capabilities for employment, education, civic participation, and social networks that the same dwelling in an isolated location cannot. By focusing on conversion factors, capabilities approaches seem well-positioned to handle housing's location-specific value that challenges fungibility assumptions.

Batterham (2020) identifies three methodological challenges capabilities approaches must address in housing contexts. First, the process for deriving and specifying housing-related capabilities must be clear and defensible—which capabilities matter for housing justice and why? Second, there must be explicit connection between the concept of justice and housing capabilities—why do capability deprivations constitute injustices rather than merely unfortunate shortfalls? Third, different understandings of what causes capability deprivation have significant implications for policy responses—is inadequate housing capability due to individual circumstances, institutional failures, or structural conditions? These methodological questions demand resolution for capabilities approaches to realize their promise in housing policy.

Dummer and Neuhäuser (2025) press further, arguing that pure capabilities approaches inadequately capture housing justice concerns and require integration with relational egalitarian considerations. Examining Nussbaum's list of basic capabilities, they contend the list misses fundamental relational dimensions of housing. They develop self-respect as a basic capability that necessarily incorporates relational elements: one's housing situation affects one's standing in social relations and one's capacity for self-respect depends on how housing positions one relative to others. An adequate capabilitarian view must address these relational aspects, not merely individual functionings. This critique suggests capabilities approaches need supplementation from relational frameworks to handle housing's social and civic dimensions.

The capabilities framework thus faces a persistent question: does it escape the fungibility assumption or merely relocate it? If capabilities themselves are commensurable—if we can trade housing capabilities against other capabilities via some master metric—then the fungibility problem reappears at the capability level. Housing's location-specific value becomes invisible if capabilities frameworks treat capabilities for employment, education, civic participation, and social networks as fungible with capabilities achievable through other means. But if housing-related capabilities are non-fungible, capabilities approaches need principles for adjudicating conflicts among non-commensurable capabilities. How should we balance capabilities for housing security (favoring incumbent protection) against capabilities for accessing high-opportunity locations (favoring newcomer access) when these conflict?

Taylor (2020) suggests that Rawlsian justice frameworks might contribute to capabilities-based housing policy evaluation rather than competing with it, proposing integration between approaches. But the relationship between capabilities and contractualist principles requires clarification. Can contractualist reasonable rejection criteria specify which capabilities matter most and how to prioritize among them? Or do capabilities approaches offer resources—attention to conversion factors, focus on actual freedoms—that contractualist frameworks should incorporate?

### 4.3 Relational Equality and Domination

Relational egalitarian approaches emphasize social standing, domination, and hierarchical relationships rather than distributive patterns. Cass (2023, 2024) develops relational equality's implications for housing with particular attention to civic status. He argues that relational equality has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions: civic status depends on one's relative standing and unfolds over time through participation in civic life. Housing matters for relational equality not merely because inadequate housing causes absolute deprivation but because residential segregation creates hierarchical civic status incompatible with relating as equals. Even if all citizens meet absolute housing standards, systematic residential segregation by income or race creates civic hierarchy that violates relational equality.

This positional dimension connects to Section 1's discussion of positional goods. Cass contends that relational equality requires relatively equal access to location-based civic participation opportunities. If high-opportunity locations provide dramatically better platforms for civic engagement—through better schools, stronger social networks, proximity to political institutions—then excluding some citizens from these locations creates civic inequality. Housing location is thus not merely an individual welfare concern but a relational equality issue: where people live determines their civic standing and their ability to participate as equals in collective self-governance.

Jenkins (2022) analyzes gentrification through the republican freedom framework as domination—arbitrary interference by landlords and developers that undermines residents' freedom as non-domination. Gentrification creates relationships of domination when property owners can arbitrarily raise rents, convert uses, or displace residents without meaningful constraints. The state's role in facilitating gentrification through zoning changes, development incentives, and failure to protect tenants constitutes state-enabled domination. Wells (2021) extends this analysis to state-led gentrification's expressive harms, arguing that government-initiated displacement communicates that displaced residents have inferior civic standing, damaging self-respect and equal standing independently of material losses.

Dawkins (2023) provides the most comprehensive recent taxonomy of gentrification injustices, identifying eight distinct forms: deprivation (material losses), estrangement (loss of place attachment), erasure (destruction of community memory), domination (arbitrary interference), censure (moral judgment of residents), exploitation (extraction of value), disrespect (failure to recognize standing), and marginalization (exclusion from public space and civic life). Notably, domination appears both as a distinct injustice and as contributing to other forms—landlords' arbitrary power enables exploitation and marginalization, while state decisions embody disrespect. Dawkins argues the state has ultimate moral obligation to rectify these plural injustices through institutional reform, not merely to blame individual actors.

Lloyd (2023) argues that philosophical critiques of gentrification have overemphasized residential displacement while neglecting non-displacement harms. Drawing on social science evidence, he contends that gentrification damages thriving communities even when original residents remain, by undermining the goods conferred through community membership. This community-centered critique grounds objections to gentrification in occupancy rights derived from communal labor: residents who have invested in building community infrastructure (social networks, mutual aid systems, cultural institutions) have rights to remain and to protect those community goods from destruction. Gentrification violates these rights by destroying community goods even when individuals retain their housing.

Relational approaches offer important resources for housing justice. They capture housing's civic and community dimensions that distributive frameworks may miss. They explain why housing location matters for justice—not merely because of opportunity access but because of civic standing and non-domination. And they connect to occupancy rights literature by grounding incumbent claims in relational goods rather than mere preference or attachment.

However, relational frameworks face the intergenerational challenge noted in Section 3. Relational equality and non-domination depend on social relationships—relating as equals, freedom from arbitrary interference. But future generations do not yet stand in social relations with us, so relational theories struggle to ground obligations to them. If relational equality requires preventing present civic hierarchies but permits creating future ones through irreversible planning decisions, the framework seems incomplete. Bengtson (2025) and Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) develop this "intergenerational justice dilemma" for relational approaches: obligations based on relating as equals seemingly cannot extend to non-overlapping generations who never relate at all.

Pettit (2012) distinguishes between legitimacy (how coercion is imposed) and justice (what order is imposed), arguing that legitimacy requires non-domination rather than hypothetical consent. This move potentially creates space for contractualist integration: perhaps non-domination specifies necessary conditions for legitimacy while contractualist reasonable rejection specifies sufficient conditions for justice. But the relationship between these frameworks requires clarification.

### 4.4 Positioning Contractualism

These alternative frameworks each illuminate aspects of housing justice while facing distinctive limitations. Rights approaches provide strong protections grounded in dignity and autonomy but struggle with content specification, rights conflicts, and institutional design. Capabilities approaches recognize conversion factors and focus on real freedoms but face questions about whether they escape fungibility at the capability level and how to prioritize incommensurable capabilities. Relational approaches capture housing's civic and community dimensions but struggle to ground intergenerational obligations in the absence of social relations.

Contractualist frameworks must explain what they offer that these alternatives cannot. Three possibilities emerge. First, contractualist reasonable rejection criteria may provide principled grounds for specifying housing rights content, adjudicating rights conflicts, and designing institutions—what reasonable persons could not reject constrains how we specify and implement housing rights. Second, contractualism may offer resources for prioritizing among capabilities when they conflict: perhaps the capabilities people need most are those without which their claims could be reasonably rejected. Third, contractualist frameworks may extend to intergenerational contexts through epistemic duties (as Section 3 argued) rather than relational obligations, avoiding the intergenerational justice dilemma that plagues relational approaches.

Alternatively, contractualism may require integration with these frameworks rather than replacement. Perhaps rights, capabilities, and relational equality specify what reasonable persons could not reject in different domains—rights for basic needs, capabilities for opportunity, relational equality for civic standing—and contractualist principles coordinate among these considerations. Halliday and Meyer's (2024) call for normative frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality suggests space for contractualist contributions, but whether contractualism offers a comprehensive alternative or a complementary framework remains an open question that the housing justice project must address.
