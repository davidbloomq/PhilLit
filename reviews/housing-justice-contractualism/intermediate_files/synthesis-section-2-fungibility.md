## Section 1: The Fungibility Assumption and Location-Specific Value

Dominant contractualist frameworks for distributive justice—both Rawlsian and Dworkinian—implicitly assume that goods can be rendered commensurable through standardized metrics, enabling interpersonal comparisons and trade-offs essential for contractualist justification. Yet housing in particular locations resists this fungibility assumption. Empirical evidence from urban economics demonstrates that location generates irreducible productive value through agglomeration mechanisms that cannot be exported or replicated elsewhere, while philosophical theories of positional and contextual goods provide conceptual resources for understanding goods whose value depends essentially on relational or spatial features. This section establishes that location-specific value challenges the fungibility assumption at the heart of contractualist frameworks, creating the first systematic failing when standard approaches confront housing justice.

### Primary Goods and the Fungibility Assumption

Rawls's theory of justice as fairness treats primary goods—"things that every rational man is presumed to want" including "rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth"—as an index enabling interpersonal comparisons while respecting reasonable pluralism about the good life (Rawls 1971, p. 62). The primary goods metric abstracts from particular attachments and conceptions of value, providing "all-purpose means" useful for pursuing diverse life plans (Rawls 2001). This abstraction enables the original position thought experiment: behind the veil of ignorance, rational agents select principles of justice without knowledge of their particular circumstances, attachments, or values. The framework assumes that what matters for justice can be captured through a weighted index of fungible goods, where inequalities in one dimension (income) might be justified by advantages in another (opportunities) via the difference principle.

Dworkin's equality of resources makes fungibility even more explicit. His hypothetical auction mechanism requires that all resources be tradeable and substitutable, with justice achieved when no one prefers another's bundle to their own (the envy test). Resources are distributed equally when they pass this market-based commensurability test, treating goods as inherently comparable through exchange (Dworkin 1981). The framework depends fundamentally on fungibility: if some goods resist substitution because their value is constituted by features that cannot be replicated or compensated, the auction mechanism and envy test break down.

Anderson's (1999) critique of "luck egalitarianism" challenges this resourcist focus on distributing "neutral resources" that can be metrically equalized. She argues that justice concerns not metric equivalence but whether citizens can function as equals in democratic society—a relational rather than distributive standard. Democratic equality requires capabilities for equal standing, which depend on social and environmental context in ways that resist reduction to fungible resource holdings. Anderson's emphasis on functionings and social relations suggests that goods enabling equal democratic participation may not be substitutable with generic income or wealth transfers, particularly when value depends on relational or spatial features.

The capabilities approach more generally highlights conversion factors—personal, social, and environmental conditions determining whether resources translate into valuable functionings (Sen 1985). Location emerges as a critical environmental conversion factor: the same housing unit provides radically different capabilities depending on access to employment, education, social networks, and political institutions. Yet Sen's framework treats location as affecting conversion of resources into capabilities, potentially preserving a form of fungibility at the capability level. Nussbaum's (2011) more specified approach resists single-metric commensurability by identifying distinct central capabilities requiring threshold protection, but the question remains whether her framework successfully escapes fungibility assumptions or merely shifts them from resources to capabilities.

These frameworks share a common structure: they require some metric—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—for making interpersonal comparisons and evaluating distributive arrangements. The critical question is whether housing in particular locations fits these metrics or resists them. If location-specific value is irreducible to fungible measures, contractualist frameworks premised on commensurable goods face fundamental difficulties in handling housing justice.

### Location-Specific Value and Agglomeration

Urban economics provides compelling empirical evidence that location generates non-exportable value through agglomeration externalities—productivity gains arising from geographic concentration of economic activity. Duranton and Puga's (2004) comprehensive analysis identifies three micro-foundations for agglomeration economies: *sharing* mechanisms (reducing costs through pooled infrastructure, specialized suppliers, and risk-pooling in thick markets); *matching* mechanisms (improving match quality between workers and firms in dense labor markets); and *learning* mechanisms (facilitating knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face interaction). These mechanisms operate at the level of individual interactions to generate city-level productivity advantages that are genuinely location-specific—they depend on the thick markets, specialized infrastructure, and knowledge networks present only in high-density, economically concentrated areas.

The magnitude of these effects is substantial. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) demonstrate that housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities like New York and San Francisco create spatial misallocation of labor, preventing workers from moving to locations where their productivity would be highest. Their spatial equilibrium model estimates that these constraints lowered aggregate US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009—a staggering cost arising from the inability to access location-specific productivity gains. The mechanism operates through housing prices that effectively ration access: when supply is constrained, rising prices deter migration even when wage differentials signal productivity advantages, resulting in systematic underutilization of productive locations.

Ganong and Shoag (2017) document the distributional consequences of this spatial misallocation. Before 1980, low-skill workers migrated to high-income places and experienced income gains, driving regional income convergence across US states. After 1980, disproportionate housing price increases in high-income areas made such migration unprofitable for low-skill workers, who redirected to lower-income locations. This ended historic regional convergence, with housing costs creating spatial segregation by skill level—concentrating low-skill workers in low-productivity areas not by choice but by exclusion through unaffordable housing. The divergence in skill-specific returns to location demonstrates that agglomeration value is not uniformly distributed: workers who would benefit most from access to productive locations face the highest barriers.

De Groot, Poot, and Smit's (2016) meta-analysis synthesizes hundreds of empirical studies, confirming robust positive productivity effects from urban density with knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as the most important mechanisms. Critically, urbanization economies (city-size effects) dominate localization economies (industry-specific clustering), suggesting that broad access to large cities matters for productivity, not merely access to specialized industry clusters. This has implications for fungibility arguments: the productivity gains from agglomeration are not industry-specific amenities that might be substitutable across locations, but general urban advantages tied to city scale and density.

These agglomeration mechanisms generate value that is genuinely non-exportable. Knowledge spillovers operate through face-to-face interaction and social networks that cannot be replicated remotely (Eriksson and Lengyel 2018). Labor market matching benefits depend on market thickness—the number and diversity of potential employers and workers—which varies dramatically across locations (Duranton and Puga 2004). Shared infrastructure and specialized suppliers exist only where demand justifies their presence, making these benefits available exclusively in concentrated locations. The productivity gains from agglomeration are not characteristics that can be packed up and moved or compensated through income transfers—they are constituted by the spatial concentration itself.

This creates a fundamental challenge for fungibility assumptions in contractualist frameworks. If location generates non-exportable productivity gains of the magnitude Hsieh and Moretti document—sufficient to reduce GDP growth by more than a third—then housing in productive locations cannot be treated as fungible with housing elsewhere plus compensating income differentials. The value is location-specific in a constitutive sense: it exists only in particular places and cannot be replicated or fully compensated. Workers excluded from high-productivity locations through housing constraints do not merely face higher costs or inconvenience—they are systematically denied access to productivity-enhancing networks, knowledge spillovers, and matching opportunities that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

### Positional Goods and Contextual Value

Philosophical theories of positional and contextual goods provide conceptual frameworks for understanding goods whose value depends essentially on relational or spatial features, challenging the monistic assumption that all goods can be distributed according to universal principles. Brighouse and Swift (2006) establish that positional goods—goods whose value depends on one's relative standing—generate convergence among typically competing distributive principles. When goods have positional aspects, egalitarians, prioritarians, and sufficientarians converge on favoring more equal distributions than they would for non-positional goods, because relative deprivation matters for well-being independent of absolute levels. The authors distinguish goods that are positional in their nature (like status), in their value (like educational credentials), or in their effects, providing analytical tools for characterizing how relational features affect distributive requirements.

Cass (2023) refines this convergence thesis, showing it succeeds particularly for civic status—the central concern of relational or "social" egalitarianism. Relational equality requires equal civic status, which is inherently positional: one's standing as a citizen partly depends on how one ranks relative to others in access to political participation, public institutions, and community membership. Even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality must therefore favor relatively equal distributions of goods affecting civic status, because extreme inequality in these dimensions creates hierarchical social relations incompatible with equal standing. Housing location plausibly affects civic status in precisely this way: residential segregation by income creates differential access to political institutions, public goods, and community participation that constitutes civic status inequality beyond mere resource differences.

In her subsequent work, Cass (2024) argues that relational equality has distinctive temporal dimensions—civic status unfolds over time, with cumulative segregation across generations compounding status hierarchies. This temporal aspect matters for housing because residential patterns exhibit strong path-dependence: where one's family has lived affects network access, educational opportunities, and community integration in ways that compound across generations. If housing location affects civic status temporally as well as positionally, then policies treating housing as fungible (exchangeable for money compensation upon displacement) fail to respect how location-constituted civic status develops over time and resists substitution.

Freiman (2014) exposes tensions between prioritarian frameworks (focusing on benefiting the worse-off) and positional goods. Prioritarianism evaluates distributions based on absolute welfare levels, yet positional goods' value depends on relative standing. When goods are positional, increasing everyone's absolute level may not improve anyone's situation if relative positions remain unchanged, yet prioritarianism would count this as improvement. Conversely, equalizing positional goods through leveling down might improve relative standing despite reducing absolute welfare. This suggests that location-specific goods with positional aspects may require explicitly relational or egalitarian principles rather than absolute welfare-focused approaches—a conclusion that challenges the difference principle's focus on maximizing the absolute position of the least advantaged.

Pluralist approaches to distributive justice provide theoretical space for goods that resist universal commensuration. Walzer's (1983) spheres of justice argues that different goods belong to distinct spheres with internal distributive logics: membership, security, welfare, money, education, and political power should each be distributed according to principles appropriate to their social meanings, not a single universal metric. Injustice occurs through "tyranny"—when success in one sphere (wealth) illegitimately converts to dominance in another (political power or spatial access). If housing and location constitute a distinct sphere with social meaning tied to community membership, access to opportunities, and political participation, then their distribution should follow principles appropriate to that sphere rather than pure market allocation or generalized resource equality. Walzer's anti-conversion principle particularly resonates: wealth should not automatically convert to exclusive spatial access when location provides goods (civic participation, community membership) that belong to non-market spheres.

Miller's (1999) contextual pluralism offers a more critical version, grounding different distributive principles not in existing social meanings (which might reflect unjust conventions) but in the nature of relationships. Solidaristic communities distribute by need, instrumental associations by desert, and citizenship by equality. Housing in particular locations potentially spans these contexts: it constitutes membership in local communities (solidaristic), provides access to employment (instrumental), and enables political participation (citizenship). This multiplicity suggests that different principles might apply simultaneously, with housing distribution governed partly by need (shelter), partly by contribution (housing as reward), and partly by equality (civic access)—a complexity that resists reduction to fungible resource metrics.

Kymlicka's (1989, 1995) liberal multiculturalist framework establishes precedent within Rawlsian frameworks for goods that are context-dependent and not straightforwardly fungible. He argues that cultural membership should be recognized as a primary good—something rational persons want regardless of their conception of the good—because cultural structure provides the context of choice within which individuals form and pursue life plans. Without access to a rich cultural structure, individual autonomy is severely compromised, yet cultural membership cannot be compensated through generic resources because it provides irreplaceable context for identity and meaningful choice. This parallels the argument for location-specific value: particular locations provide irreplaceable context through community networks, employment opportunities, public institutions, and social capital that cannot be replicated elsewhere or compensated through fungible resources. If Rawlsian frameworks can accommodate cultural membership as a special good, they potentially have conceptual resources to accommodate location-specific goods without abandoning contractualism entirely.

However, the capabilities approach may preserve fungibility assumptions despite emphasizing context-dependence. Sen (1985) treats location as an environmental conversion factor affecting how resources translate into capabilities, but this framework still assumes capabilities themselves provide a common metric for comparison. Nussbaum's (2011) rejection of single-metric commensurability across capabilities moves further from fungibility, but even here the question remains whether location-constituted capabilities are genuinely incommensurable or merely weighted differently in threshold requirements. The distinction matters: if location affects conversion factors, then adequate compensation through additional resources might suffice; if location constitutes capabilities themselves in non-replicable ways, then no compensation can substitute for access.

The philosophical literature on positional and contextual goods thus provides conceptual tools for analyzing location-specific value but has not systematically applied them to housing. Positional goods theory explains why location value might resist fungibility when it depends on relative access or status. Contextual pluralism recognizes that goods tied to particular forms of association (community, citizenship) may require distinct distributive principles. Cultural membership precedents show liberal frameworks can accommodate non-fungible goods. Yet these resources remain under-developed in housing contexts: few philosophers have explicitly challenged fungibility assumptions in Rawls or Dworkin regarding housing, and none have systematically connected positional goods theory, agglomeration economics, and contractualist frameworks to analyze housing justice.

### The First Failing

Location generates non-fungible value through agglomeration mechanisms—knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, shared infrastructure—that create productivity gains available only in particular places and non-replicable elsewhere. The empirical magnitude is substantial: housing constraints preventing access to high-productivity locations reduced US GDP growth by 36 percent over four decades and ended regional income convergence by redirecting low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich areas. These are not merely preferences for particular amenities that might be traded off against other goods; they are constitutive features of locations that determine productivity, opportunity access, and civic participation in ways that resist compensation through fungible resources.

Standard contractualist frameworks implicitly assume goods are fungible—commensurable via primary goods indices, resource bundles passing envy tests, or capability metrics. This assumption enables the interpersonal comparisons and trade-offs essential for contractualist justification: principles can be chosen behind the veil of ignorance because goods are treated as all-purpose means rather than context-specific values, and inequalities in one dimension can be justified by advantages in another. Yet if location-specific value is constitutive rather than convertible, these frameworks lack adequate tools. Housing in productive locations cannot be indexed alongside income and wealth as fungible primary goods if its value depends irreducibly on non-exportable agglomeration externalities. Displacement compensation through monetary transfers cannot satisfy envy tests if location-constituted networks and opportunities are non-replicable. Capability approaches may recognize location as a conversion factor but inadequately capture how location constitutes rather than merely converts value.

Positional goods theory and contextual pluralism provide conceptual resources for non-fungible goods within liberal frameworks, demonstrating that contractualism need not collapse when confronting goods that resist universal metrics. Kymlicka's cultural membership precedent shows primary goods frameworks can be expanded beyond fungible resources to accommodate context-providing goods essential for autonomy. Relational equality approaches recognize that civic status depends on positional features resistant to simple resource redistribution. Yet these philosophical resources remain disconnected from housing justice debates and under-integrated with empirical evidence on agglomeration externalities.

The first failing is thus structural: contractualist frameworks premised on commensurable goods—whether primary goods, resources, or capabilities—cannot adequately handle housing when location constitutes value in ways that resist fungibility. This is not merely an application gap but a conceptual mismatch between frameworks assuming all-purpose means and goods whose value is irreducibly location-specific. The challenge facing contractualism is whether it can develop principles for distributing non-fungible goods without abandoning the justificatory structure that gives contractualism its distinctive force: principles that can be reasonably accepted by all affected parties must now account for goods that cannot be straightforwardly compared, traded off, or compensated across locations.
