## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [x] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [x] Phase 3: Research domains in parallel
- [x] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [x] Phase 5: Write review for each section in parallel
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-02: Phase 1 complete - Environment verified (all APIs reachable), execution mode: Full Autopilot
2026-01-02: Phase 2 complete - Created lit-review-plan.md (8 domains, 120-150 estimated papers)
2026-01-02: Phase 3 complete - Collected 144 papers across 8 domains (no source issues)
2026-01-02: Phase 4 complete - Created synthesis-outline.md (4 sections + gaps + conclusion)
2026-01-02: Phase 5 complete - Wrote 7 sections (~11,600 words total)

## Current Task

Phase 6: Assembling final review files

## Next Steps

1. Invoke literature-review-planner agent to decompose research into domains
2. Review generated lit-review-plan.md
3. Launch domain researchers in parallel
