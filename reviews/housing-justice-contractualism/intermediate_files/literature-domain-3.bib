====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses a fundamental tension in political philosophy between
the rights of incumbent residents to remain in place (occupancy rights) and
the claims of outsiders to access territory or neighborhoods. The "occupancy
turn" emerged with Anna Stilz's work on territorial sovereignty (2019),
grounding territorial rights in individuals' occupancy rather than collective
self-determination alone. Huber and Wolkenstein (2018) extended this framework
to gentrification, arguing that residents have occupancy rights to remain in
neighborhoods where their "located life plans" are anchored.

The domain encompasses three interconnected debates: (1) philosophical
foundations of occupancy rights (Stilz, Moore, Mancilla), (2) gentrification
ethics and displacement justice (Lloyd, van Leeuwen, Dawkins, Draper, Jenkins),
and (3) the tension between protection of existing residents and claims of
newcomers. Recent work increasingly recognizes that gentrification threatens
not only through direct displacement but through neighborhood transformation
that disrupts the "background conditions" enabling residents' life plans.

Key recent developments (2020-2025) include: more sophisticated accounts of
what makes displacement wrongful beyond property loss (Lloyd 2023, van Leeuwen
2024); attention to domination and structural injustice in gentrification
(Jenkins 2022, Hoover 2023); and recognition that occupancy rights create
democratic claims over neighborhood governance (Wells 2021, Draper 2022).
A critical gap remains: few theorists directly address the contractualist
stand-off between incumbents and excluded outsiders.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project's examination of the
contractualist dilemma in housing justice. The occupancy rights literature
establishes that incumbents have weighty claims to stability and protection
from displacement, grounded in their located life plans. However, the literature
largely fails to address how these occupancy-based claims can be justified to
excluded outsiders who also need access to place to pursue their life plans.
This gap represents precisely the contractualist impasse the research project
aims to illuminate: principles protecting occupancy cannot be justified to the
excluded, yet principles prioritizing access cannot be justified to vulnerable
incumbents facing displacement.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection, with minimal
attention to access claims of excluded populations. Few papers explicitly
address the trade-off between occupancy and access, or examine how principles
might balance these competing claims. The contractualist framing of this
tension is entirely absent. Additionally, most work focuses on gentrification
in affluent nations, with limited attention to displacement in the Global South
or to climate-induced displacement that raises similar occupancy vs. access
tensions.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should map two primary positions: (1) occupancy-priority views
that emphasize protection of incumbent residents (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein,
Moore), and (2) emerging critiques that identify limitations of pure occupancy
approaches (Mancilla on dynamic occupancy, Lloyd on community goods). The
synthesis should emphasize that while the occupancy literature provides rich
resources for understanding incumbent claims, it systematically neglects the
perspective of excluded outsiders—precisely the blindspot a contractualist
analysis would reveal.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Occupancy Rights Theory: 8 papers - Incumbents have moral rights to remain in
  place where life plans are located (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein, Moore, Lloyd)
- Gentrification as Rights Violation: 7 papers - Displacement and transformation
  violate occupancy rights (van Leeuwen, Dawkins, Wells, Draper, Jenkins)
- Access vs. Occupancy Tension: 3 papers - Recognition of competing claims
  (Mancilla, Kim & Walton, Bonotti & Barnhill)

  author = {Stilz, Anna},
  title = {Territorial Sovereignty: A Philosophical Exploration},
  year = {2019},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198833536.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stilz develops a Kantian account of territorial rights grounded in three values: occupancy rights, basic justice, and collective self-determination. She argues that territorial sovereignty is justified not primarily through collective self-determination but through individuals' pre-political occupancy rights—their interest in remaining in places where their "located life plans" are anchored. This represents a fundamental reconceptualization: territorial rights protect individual autonomy through place-stability rather than collective control.

  RELEVANCE: Stilz's occupancy framework is foundational for this research domain and the broader project. Her account provides philosophical grounding for incumbent residents' claims to remain in place, establishing that displacement threatens core autonomy interests. However, her focus on occupancy as the primary ground for territorial rights raises the project's central question: how can occupancy-based principles be justified to excluded outsiders who also need access to territory to pursue their life plans? Stilz does not address this tension directly.

  POSITION: Represents the foundational "occupancy turn" in political philosophy, prioritizing individuals' located autonomy interests over purely collective grounds for territorial rights.

  pages = {378--397},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X18766818},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends Stilz's occupancy rights framework to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have moral rights to remain in neighborhoods where their "social, cultural, and economic practices are anchored." Displacement wrongs residents by disrupting the "background conditions" that enable their located life plans. Crucially, these rights extend beyond direct displacement to include protection against neighborhood transformation that undermines the spatial arrangements on which residents' plans depend. They propose participatory budgeting and democratic governance mechanisms to operationalize occupancy rights.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is central to the research project as it applies occupancy theory directly to housing and gentrification, the project's empirical focus. It establishes that incumbents have strong claims not merely to housing stability but to neighborhood character preservation. However, the paper exemplifies the project's concern: Huber and Wolkenstein focus entirely on protecting incumbents without addressing how such protection can be justified to excluded populations who need access to neighborhoods to pursue their own life plans. The paper notes but does not resolve that occupancy rights may conflict with newcomers' mobility rights.

  POSITION: Paradigmatic occupancy-priority position, arguing for robust incumbent protection including governance rights over neighborhood change.

  pages = {1246--1264},
  doi = {10.1080/07352166.2023.2216889},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lloyd advances beyond displacement-focused critiques by arguing that non-displacement gentrification also harms residents through damage to "thriving local communities." He synthesizes multiple theoretical approaches: occupancy rights (following Huber & Wolkenstein), relational equality concerns, and Lockean arguments that communities have labored together to create value. Lloyd argues that community goods constitute a separate sphere of justice à la Walzer, and that gentrification threatens these goods even without direct displacement through disruption of social networks, local institutions, and shared practices.

  RELEVANCE: Lloyd's focus on community goods rather than individual displacement connects directly to the project's concern with how social relationships constitute claims. His recognition that gentrification harms extend beyond displacement suggests occupancy rights may need to be understood more broadly than individual stability. However, Lloyd shares the field's blindspot: he does not address how community-preserving policies can be justified to excluded outsiders who need access to opportunities concentrated in these communities.

  POSITION: Occupancy rights theorist who broadens the framework to encompass collective goods and community integrity, moving beyond individualistic displacement focus.

  volume = {48},
  pages = {1--20},
  doi = {10.1177/03091325241289546},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Van Leeuwen provides a systematic survey of philosophical arguments about gentrification-related displacement, identifying five main approaches: autonomy-based (located life plans), community-based (social bonds), equality-based (relational equality), domination-based (structural power), and rights-based (occupancy rights proper). He argues that Huber and Wolkenstein's occupancy framework has been most influential but notes internal tensions—particularly regarding what counts as wrongful transformation versus acceptable neighborhood change. Van Leeuwen emphasizes that the literature converges on protecting "place-based" or "located life-plans" as the core concern.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive review clarifies the conceptual architecture of the gentrification ethics literature, revealing both its strengths and systematic gaps. Van Leeuwen identifies the field's consensus around protecting incumbent residents' autonomy through place-stability, which connects to the project's focus on occupancy claims. His observation that the literature focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection with minimal attention to newcomer claims directly supports the project's diagnosis of a contractualist blind spot.

  POSITION: Neutral surveyor who maps the field's occupancy-priority consensus while noting tensions and gaps in existing approaches.

  volume = {41},
  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2023.2181863},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dawkins examines gentrification through the lens of autonomy and located life plans, arguing that displacement wrongs residents by depriving them of "secure access to places of residence" necessary for pursuing any conception of the good. He distinguishes between direct displacement (forced exit) and indirect displacement (priced out), arguing both violate occupancy rights. Dawkins emphasizes that for disadvantaged populations, local communities function as crucial support networks, making displacement particularly harmful. He argues for regulatory interventions including rent control and community land trusts to protect occupancy.

  RELEVANCE: Dawkins connects occupancy theory directly to housing policy, demonstrating practical implications of philosophical principles. His emphasis on disadvantaged populations' particular vulnerability to displacement relates to the project's attention to structural injustice. However, Dawkins exemplifies the pattern: robust arguments for incumbent protection without addressing how these protections can be justified to excluded populations competing for scarce housing.

  POSITION: Occupancy-rights theorist focused on practical policy implementation and particular vulnerability of disadvantaged communities to displacement.

@article{draper2022gentrification,

  title = {Gentrification and everyday democracy},
  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {1--21},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851221137510},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Draper argues that gentrification threatens "everyday democracy"—the informal democratic practices through which residents exercise collective agency over shared spaces. Drawing on occupancy rights theory, Draper contends that gentrification undermines residents' capacity to shape their neighborhoods through practices like community organizing, local decision-making, and collective action. She argues occupancy rights should include democratic participation rights, not merely rights against displacement. This reframes gentrification as a democratic deficit, not only an individual autonomy violation.

  RELEVANCE: Draper's focus on democratic dimensions of occupancy connects to contractualist concerns about justification: if occupancy rights include governance claims, this intensifies questions about how such exclusionary control can be justified to outsiders. Her work suggests occupancy theory may have more expansive implications than typically recognized, potentially deepening rather than resolving the tension between incumbent and newcomer claims.

  POSITION: Occupancy-rights theorist who extends the framework to encompass democratic participation and collective agency over neighborhood change.

@article{jenkins2022domination,

  title = {Gentrification as domination},
  journal = {Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy},

  volume = {26},
  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2022.2119523},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jenkins argues that gentrification constitutes domination in the republican sense—arbitrary interference in residents' lives that undermines their freedom as non-domination. He critiques occupancy rights approaches (particularly Huber & Wolkenstein) for focusing too narrowly on located life plans, which excludes residents whose connection to place is less plan-structured. Jenkins argues gentrification dominates residents by subjecting them to arbitrary power of landlords, developers, and newcomers who can unilaterally transform neighborhoods. He emphasizes structural dimensions often missed by individualistic autonomy approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Jenkins provides important critical perspective on occupancy theory, noting its potential to exclude some vulnerable residents. His domination framework connects to republican and structural justice concerns that might inform contractualist analysis. However, Jenkins shares the field's limitation: his focus on protecting residents from domination does not address whether such protection could dominate excluded outsiders by denying them access to opportunity.

  POSITION: Republican critic of pure occupancy approaches who emphasizes structural domination and arbitrary power in gentrification processes.

  volume = {70},
  pages = {1--20},
  doi = {10.1177/0032321721989168},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wells argues that state-led gentrification uniquely threatens residents' self-respect—their sense of themselves as worthy of equal moral status. When the state actively promotes gentrification, it sends a message that incumbent residents are less valuable than incoming wealthier populations. Wells builds on occupancy rights theory but emphasizes expressive harms: gentrification doesn't only threaten material interests but publicly devalues residents. She argues for enhanced democratic rights over neighborhoods as remedy, allowing residents to exercise collective control over neighborhood transformation.

  RELEVANCE: Wells connects occupancy concerns to recognition and standing, relevant to contractualist questions about justification and respect. Her focus on state-led gentrification raises questions about legitimate state action that connects to contractualist requirements. However, she does not address whether enhanced democratic control for incumbents could itself constitute disrespect toward excluded outsiders denied voice in decisions affecting their access to opportunity.

  POSITION: Occupancy-rights theorist emphasizing expressive and recognition dimensions of displacement alongside material harms.

  volume = {52},
  pages = {1--27},
  doi = {10.1177/00905917231178295},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoover synthesizes multiple approaches to gentrification injustice, examining how gentrification violates occupancy rights (through displacement), undermines community bonds, and instantiates structural injustice. He argues that gentrification is distinctively wrongful because it compounds existing injustices faced by marginalized communities, adding spatial displacement to historical patterns of exclusion and exploitation. Hoover emphasizes that gentrification cannot be understood apart from histories of racial segregation, disinvestment, and unequal development that create vulnerability to displacement.

  RELEVANCE: Hoover's attention to structural injustice and historical context connects to the project's concern with cumulative disadvantage and patterns of exclusion. His framework suggests that occupancy claims may be strengthened by historical injustice—but this raises contractualist questions about whether past wrongs justify present exclusion of outsiders who bear no responsibility for historical injustice.

  POSITION: Structural injustice theorist who situates gentrification within broader patterns of racial and economic inequality.

  volume = {23},
  pages = {757--764},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2020.1797388},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Moore critiques Stilz's individualistic conception of occupancy rights for failing to distinguish between individual "Life-Planners" (people whose plans happen to be located somewhere) and Indigenous peoples whose connections to place are historical, collective, and constitutive of identity. Moore argues Stilz's framework inadequately explains the scope and weight of occupancy rights in cases like Navajo displacement, which involve collective territorial connections beyond individual life plans. She argues for group-based conceptions of occupancy to supplement individual residency rights.

  RELEVANCE: Moore's critique reveals important limitations of individualistic occupancy theory for understanding some displacement claims, particularly those involving Indigenous peoples or communities with deep historical connections to place. This connects to the project's concern with how different grounds for claims create different justificatory requirements. However, Moore focuses on strengthening incumbent claims rather than addressing tensions with access claims.

  volume = {23},
  pages = {765--772},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2020.1797389},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mancilla challenges Stilz's emphasis on "located" life plans by arguing that occupancy rights should protect "dynamic" as well as located occupancy—the freedom to move and pursue non-territorial life plans. She argues that Stilz's framework privileges settled, place-attached populations over mobile peoples (pastoralists, nomads, migrants) whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. Mancilla contends that protecting only located occupancy allows states to exclude mobile populations, undermining the autonomy rationale occupancy theory claims to serve.

  RELEVANCE: Mancilla's argument directly addresses a tension central to the research project: occupancy theory's focus on incumbent protection may systematically disadvantage mobile populations and newcomers. Her call for "dynamic occupancy" rights represents rare attention to access claims within occupancy literature. However, she does not fully develop how to balance located and dynamic occupancy when they conflict, which is precisely the contractualist challenge the project addresses.

  POSITION: Critical voice arguing occupancy theory systematically privileges settled over mobile populations, advocating for mobility rights alongside stability rights.

  volume = {7},
  pages = {1--20},
  doi = {10.1007/s41055-022-00101-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bonotti and Barnhill extend occupancy rights analysis to food environments, arguing that gentrification threatens residents' located life plans through changes in food access, including loss of culturally appropriate foods, affordable options, and familiar food establishments. They argue that newcomers also develop occupancy interests once settled, complicating simple incumbent-newcomer distinctions. They propose anti-gentrification measures scaled to the compounding of disadvantage: stronger protections for already-disadvantaged groups, more modest protections for advantaged incumbents.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly engages the incumbent-newcomer tension, recognizing that newcomers develop occupancy interests that conflict with incumbent claims. Their attention to scaling protections by advantage level suggests possible principles for balancing claims. However, they do not fully address the contractualist question: how can differential treatment based on group membership be justified to those disadvantaged by it?

  pages = {1--19},
  doi = {10.1017/S0007123422000412},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kim and Walton examine residential integration policies, arguing that advantaged groups relocating to disadvantaged neighborhoods can be permissible if properly regulated to prevent displacement. They acknowledge occupancy rights concerns but argue these can be addressed through regulation rather than restricting mobility. They contend that integration can benefit disadvantaged residents through improved services and opportunities, provided genuine anti-displacement protections exist. This represents rare attention to potential benefits of newcomer arrival for incumbents.

  RELEVANCE: Kim and Walton directly address the tension between incumbent occupancy claims and newcomer access claims, arguing for regulatory approaches that might balance both. Their framework attempts to satisfy both incumbents (through displacement protection) and newcomers (through access permissions). However, they do not examine whether their proposals can satisfy contractualist requirements of justifiability to all affected parties.

  volume = {18},
  pages = {1--18},
  doi = {10.1080/12265934.2013.834643},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fainstein develops a theory of urban justice based on three principles: democracy, diversity, and equity. She critiques purely procedural (Habermasian) approaches for failing to ensure just outcomes, and recognition-based approaches for neglecting material inequality. Drawing on Lefebvre's "right to the city," she argues that justice requires all groups have access to urban opportunities and participation in urban governance. She emphasizes tensions among the three principles, particularly between equity (redistribution) and diversity (recognition of difference).

  RELEVANCE: Fainstein's framework provides rare attention to access claims in urban theory, arguing that justice requires inclusion of currently excluded groups. Her "right to the city" draws attention to claims of outsiders seeking access, not only incumbent residents. However, she does not develop how to balance access claims against occupancy claims when they conflict, particularly regarding gentrification and displacement concerns.

  doi = {10.1057/S41269-020-00178-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Van Leeuwen develops a theory of urban justice centered on access to "human space"—environments shaped by and for human activity, interaction, and meaning-making. He argues that justice requires ensuring all persons have access to diverse, vibrant human spaces that enable human flourishing. Van Leeuwen critiques both libertarian approaches (which ignore systemic exclusion) and some occupancy approaches (which may entrench existing patterns of segregation). He argues for principles that balance stability for incumbents with access for outsiders.

  RELEVANCE: Van Leeuwen provides important counterpoint to pure occupancy approaches by emphasizing access claims. His focus on what urban spaces provide (opportunities for human interaction and meaning) suggests grounds for access claims that don't depend on already being present. However, he does not fully develop how to resolve conflicts between incumbent stability and outsider access, which is the project's central concern.

  volume = {50},
  pages = {32--58},
  doi = {10.1177/00905917211008591},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jurkevics examines large-scale land acquisitions ("land grabs") that dispossess and displace inhabitants, arguing that private land purchases can constitute de facto alienation of territorial sovereignty. She critiques traditional sovereignty frameworks for enabling such dispossession, and questions whether occupancy-based theories adequately protect against it. Jurkevics argues that democracy requires "world-building" practices—participation in decisions about land use and governance—that territorial sovereignty often undermines. She proposes "fracturing" sovereignty to enable more democratic land governance.

  RELEVANCE: Jurkevics's attention to how property markets enable displacement connects to gentrification concerns while situating them in broader questions of territorial governance. Her critique that sovereignty can undermine rather than protect occupancy suggests potential tensions within occupancy theory itself. Her emphasis on "world-building" practices relates to Draper's democratic concerns and raises questions about whose world-building claims have priority.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Monaghan critiques territorial thinking that assumes exclusive control over bounded spaces ("turf"), arguing that such frameworks often "overshoot"—claiming more control than can be justified. Drawing on recent literature including Huber & Wolkenstein, he argues that territorial claims should be more modest, acknowledging overlapping claims and shared stakes. Monaghan suggests that occupancy claims don't necessarily entail exclusionary control, and that more inclusive governance arrangements may better serve the values occupancy theory aims to protect.

  RELEVANCE: Monaghan's critique of exclusionary territorial thinking directly addresses the project's concern about how occupancy-based principles can be justified to outsiders. His argument for more modest, inclusive territorial claims suggests possible directions for resolving incumbent-newcomer tensions. However, he does not fully develop what more inclusive governance would mean for displacement protection or how it would address the practical challenges of balancing competing claims.

  pages = {1--29},
  doi = {10.1111/papa.12281},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Christmas argues that urban housing restrictions, including those justified by occupancy rights concerns, can violate liberty rights of property owners and prospective residents. He contends that occupancy-based arguments for restricting development or limiting newcomer access must clear high justificatory hurdles given their impact on freedom. Christmas argues that many anti-gentrification policies cannot satisfy these requirements and constitute unjustified paternalism. He advocates for liberalizing housing supply to address affordability without restricting liberty.

  RELEVANCE: Christmas represents a libertarian challenge to occupancy-based arguments, emphasizing costs of incumbent protection for liberty and access. His focus on justifiability to those burdened by restrictions connects to contractualist concerns, though from a different direction than the project emphasizes. His work illustrates that occupancy theory faces challenges from multiple perspectives, not only from excluded outsiders but from liberty theorists concerned with restriction of economic freedom.
