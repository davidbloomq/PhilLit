## Introduction

Housing crises across liberal democracies reveal fundamental tensions in how contractualist theories handle property, place, and coercion. Despite decades of development in contractualist moral and political philosophy—from Rawls's (1971) theory of justice as fairness to Scanlon's (1998) account of reasonable rejection—these frameworks have seen surprisingly limited application to housing and land use policy. Yet housing involves direct state coercion (eminent domain, zoning, displacement) requiring justification to all affected parties—precisely the domain where contractualist reasonable rejection should apply. As Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe in their comprehensive survey of housing justice philosophy, normative frameworks beyond human flourishing and relational equality remain underdeveloped, and philosophical engagement with housing policy's macroeconomic dimensions is particularly sparse. This gap is striking given that housing policy fundamentally concerns the fair terms of social cooperation, a central contractualist concern.

This review synthesizes philosophical and empirical literature to establish that standard contractualist approaches face four systematic problems when applied to housing. First, contractualist frameworks implicitly presume that primary goods are fungible—commensurable via a single metric—yet housing generates non-fungible, location-specific value through mechanisms that resist such measurement. Rawls's (1971) primary goods framework treats goods as "all-purpose means" valuable across conceptions of the good, enabling index-based comparisons. But as urban economics demonstrates, location creates irreducible productive value through agglomeration externalities that cannot be exported, compensated, or replicated elsewhere. When housing's value is constituted by context rather than merely affected by it, standard contractualist metrics fail.

Second, housing justice involves a structural conflict between incumbent occupancy rights and excluded outsiders' access claims—a contractualist deadlock where protecting one party's legitimate claims necessarily violates another's. Recent philosophical work on occupancy rights (Stilz 2019; Huber and Wolkenstein 2018) grounds territorial claims in individuals' located life plans, extending protection against displacement and neighborhood transformation. Yet this literature systematically neglects how such protection can be justified to those excluded from opportunity-rich locations who equally need access to pursue their own life plans. This occupancy-versus-access stand-off represents a paradigmatic contractualist problem: competing legitimate claims that cannot both be fully satisfied require principles justifiable to all affected parties, yet current frameworks lack resources for resolving or even adequately framing such conflicts.

Third, housing's dual role as both necessity and wealth-accumulation asset creates what housing systems scholars call "the really big contradiction" (Fikse and Aalbers 2020): financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations because price appreciation that enables wealth accumulation systematically destroys affordability for newcomers. This dual-role problem generates a contractualist impasse where neither appreciation nor price suppression can satisfy reasonable acceptance criteria for both incumbent owners and excluded non-owners. Property-owning democracy approaches, despite their contractualist pedigree (Freeman 2018), face acute justifiability problems when applied to housing because dispersed homeownership creates wealth inequality through appreciation, yet suppressing appreciation undermines the asset-based security such approaches aim to provide.

Fourth, urban planning decisions create irreversible path dependencies that bind future generations whose preferences remain epistemically uncertain. Standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize epistemic duties under conditions of irreversibility and uncertainty about future values. While intergenerational justice literature addresses preference uncertainty, it rarely integrates epistemic justice frameworks that could ground obligations to preserve future interpretive capacities. Planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future options may commit distinctive epistemic harms—constraining future generations' capacities to interpret and pursue their own conceptions of the good—that contractualism currently lacks resources to address.

These four failings are systematic, not merely gaps in application. They reveal that housing requires distinctive contractualist treatment beyond general distributive principles. This review demonstrates this claim by synthesizing literatures that have largely developed independently: contractualist foundations (Rawls 1971, 1993; Scanlon 1998; Freeman 2018); urban economics on agglomeration and spatial misallocation; housing systems research on financialization; philosophical work on occupancy rights and gentrification; capabilities and human rights approaches to housing justice (Wells 2019; Kimhur 2024; Shue 2020); epistemic justice theory (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013); and intergenerational obligations under uncertainty. Halliday and Meyer (2024) identify precisely this need: integration of normative analysis with empirical housing dynamics and development of frameworks beyond existing approaches.

The review proceeds as follows. Section 1 establishes the fungibility assumption's failure by examining how location generates non-exportable value through agglomeration mechanisms and civic participation requirements. Section 2 maps the occupancy-versus-access deadlock and housing's dual-role problem, showing how these create contractualist impasses where no principles can simultaneously satisfy all affected parties. Section 3 develops epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority under conditions of irreversibility and preference uncertainty. Section 4 positions contractualism against competing frameworks—human rights, capabilities, and relational equality approaches—clarifying contractualism's distinctive contribution and challenges. The synthesis concludes by identifying specific research gaps where contractualist resources require development: integration of non-fungible goods into justificatory frameworks, resolution of structural conflicts between legitimate competing claims, navigation of housing's dual-role contradiction, and grounding of epistemic duties that do not presume reciprocity or social relations with future generations.

This review contributes not a comprehensive solution to housing justice but rather clearer analysis of where contractualist justification reaches its limits and what normative resources are needed to address housing's distinctive features. The goal is to position future research that develops contractualist frameworks adequate to housing's complexity—frameworks that can handle non-fungible location-specific value, adjudicate between competing legitimate claims, address structural contradictions in housing systems, and ground epistemic obligations under planning irreversibility. Only by recognizing these systematic problems can contractualist theory develop the resources housing justice requires.
