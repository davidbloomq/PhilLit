## Research Gaps and Opportunities

This review has mapped substantial literatures across eight domains—contractualist foundations, non-fungible goods, occupancy rights, property-owning democracy, intergenerational justice, urban economics, housing systems, and applied housing ethics. Yet systematic gaps remain at their intersections, gaps that reveal both the limitations of existing approaches and opportunities for advancing housing justice theory. Five major gaps structure the space this research project aims to address.

### Gap 1: Contractualist Application to Housing

Despite contractualism's prominence in political philosophy, its systematic application to housing remains underdeveloped. Halliday and Meyer (2024) identify the need for normative frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality, yet neither Rawlsian nor Scanlonian contractualism has been systematically applied to housing's distinctive features. The contractualist foundations literature (Domain 1) shows minimal engagement with housing, property regimes, or land use regulation. Rawls's primary goods framework treats income and wealth as fungible resources without addressing whether housing in particular locations fits this model (Rawls 1971, 2001). Freeman's authoritative interpretations of the difference principle and property-owning democracy (2013, 2018) develop institutional implications but do not examine housing specifically. Scanlon's reasonable rejectability criterion (1998) offers resources for evaluating housing policies that affect place-attachment, yet neither Scanlon nor his interpreters have applied contractualism to displacement, gentrification, or housing allocation.

The applied housing ethics literature (Domain 8) relies primarily on human rights (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), capabilities (Kimhur 2024), or relational equality frameworks (Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025). Wells defends a right to autonomous dwelling grounded in autonomy rather than contractualist justification. Kimhur's capabilities approach focuses on housing opportunities, securities, and abilities without examining whether these arrangements satisfy reasonable acceptance standards. No systematic work examines whether housing policies treating occupancy as fungible with compensation, or allowing appreciation to exclude newcomers, could be reasonably rejected by those burdened.

This gap matters because housing involves direct state coercion—eminent domain, zoning, displacement—requiring justification to all affected parties, precisely the domain where contractualist reasonable rejection should apply. Yet the four failings this review has documented suggest standard contractualist frameworks lack resources to address housing's non-fungible value, competing legitimate claims, dual-role contradictions, and epistemic duties under uncertainty. Contractualist theory has not developed tools for goods where location constitutes rather than merely affects value, where protection of some necessarily excludes others, where asset and necessity functions contradict, or where irreversible decisions bind future generations whose preferences remain epistemically opaque.

**Research contribution**: This project develops contractualist frameworks specifically for housing by identifying where standard approaches fail (the four failings) and what resources contractualism needs to address them. It examines whether Rawlsian or Scanlonian contractualism, properly developed, can handle housing's distinctive features, or whether housing reveals principled limits to contractualist justification.

### Gap 2: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Literature

The urban economics literature on agglomeration externalities (Domain 6) operates independently from philosophical distributive justice debates, while housing systems research (Domain 7) documents financialization empirically but lacks normative analysis. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) quantify massive aggregate costs from housing constraints preventing efficient spatial sorting—a 36 percent GDP growth loss from 1964 to 2009—yet do not engage with justice theories that might evaluate these costs normatively. Duranton and Puga (2004) establish that agglomeration mechanisms (sharing, matching, learning) create location-specific value through irreducible spatial proximity, yet their analysis remains economic efficiency-focused without addressing fungibility assumptions in distributive justice frameworks. Ganong and Shoag (2017) document how housing costs redirected low-skill migration away from opportunity-rich locations, ending regional income convergence, but do not examine whether this violates any principles of fair opportunity access.

Conversely, philosophical housing justice literature (Domain 8) rarely engages macroeconomic evidence, as Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe. The occupancy rights literature (Domain 3) develops robust philosophical grounds for incumbent protection (Stilz 2019, Huber and Wolkenstein 2018, Lloyd 2023) without incorporating spatial misallocation findings showing aggregate costs of constraints that protect occupancy by limiting supply. The capabilities approach to housing (Kimhur 2024) emphasizes conversion factors but does not systematically engage agglomeration theory showing how location constitutes rather than merely converts productivity gains. Property-owning democracy literature (Domain 4) addresses wealth dispersal abstractly (Freeman 2013, Thomas 2016) but Gregory (2016) notes homeownership-based POD has created anti-egalitarian dynamics that empirical housing financialization studies document in detail (Fikse and Aalbers 2020, Ryan-Collins 2019).

This disconnect matters because normative principles must address actual housing dynamics—financialization, agglomeration, spatial sorting—not idealized markets. Philosophical analysis detached from institutional reality lacks policy relevance, while empirical analysis without normative frameworks cannot evaluate which costs and benefits matter for justice. The gap is particularly acute regarding housing's dual role: political economy research documents the structural contradiction between housing as affordable necessity and wealth store (Fikse and Aalbers 2020, Ryan-Collins 2019, Fuller et al. 2019), yet philosophers have not examined whether any housing price policy (appreciation or suppression) can meet contractualist reasonable acceptance standards when this contradiction obtains.

**Research contribution**: This project synthesizes agglomeration economics showing non-fungible locational value, housing financialization literature revealing dual-role contradictions, and contractualist principles to develop an integrated framework. It asks whether contractualist justification can accommodate empirical findings that location generates non-exportable productivity gains while housing financialization creates structural tensions between asset and necessity functions.

### Gap 3: The Occupancy/Access Deadlock

The occupancy rights literature has developed sophisticated accounts of incumbent claims grounded in located life plans (Stilz 2019), autonomous dwelling (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018), community goods (Lloyd 2023), and relational equality (Dawkins 2023). These frameworks establish that displacement wrongs residents by disrupting the background conditions enabling their plans, relationships, and standing. Recent work recognizes that gentrification harms extend beyond displacement to include neighborhood transformation, democratic participation threats, and domination (Draper 2022, Jenkins 2022, Wells 2021). Yet van Leeuwen's (2024) comprehensive survey confirms the field focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection with minimal attention to newcomer or excluded access claims.

Mancilla (2020) provides rare critical attention, noting that occupancy theory privileges settled over mobile populations, systematically disadvantaging those whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. But Mancilla does not fully develop how to balance located and dynamic occupancy when they conflict—when protecting settled residents necessarily excludes mobile populations from accessing opportunity. Bonotti and Barnhill (2022) recognize that newcomers develop occupancy interests that conflict with incumbent claims, proposing scaled protections by advantage level, but do not address the contractualist question: how can differential treatment based on group membership be justified to those disadvantaged by it? Kim and Walton (2022) attempt regulatory balance between occupancy protection and mobility rights, yet without examining whether proposed arrangements satisfy reasonable acceptance by both incumbents facing displacement pressure and newcomers denied access.

No papers directly frame the tension as a contractualist problem: we have competing legitimate claims that cannot both be fully satisfied under scarce housing conditions. Contractualism should provide tools for resolving or at least clarifying such conflicts where protection of some necessarily violates others' equally legitimate claims. Stilz's occupancy framework grounds territorial rights in individuals' located autonomy interests, but how can occupancy-based principles that protect incumbents' place-stability be justified to excluded outsiders who also need access to place to pursue their life plans? If both incumbents and excluded outsiders have legitimate claims grounded in autonomy, and constraints prevent satisfying both, what principles can adjudicate between them?

The urban economics literature intensifies this tension: if high-productivity locations generate non-exportable agglomeration benefits (Hsieh and Moretti 2019, Duranton and Puga 2004), excluded workers suffer opportunity costs that cannot be compensated through access to lower-productivity locations. Ganong and Shoag (2017) document that housing constraints redirected low-skill workers away from high-wage cities, systematically disadvantaging those who would most benefit from access. This creates a distributive pattern where occupancy protection concentrates opportunity among incumbents while excluding those with strongest claims to opportunity access—yet occupancy literature does not address how to justify this outcome to the excluded.

**Research contribution**: This project frames the occupancy/access tension as a contractualist impasse requiring principles justifiable to both incumbents and excluded outsiders, not merely incumbent protection. It examines whether any principles can satisfy reasonable acceptance by both parties when scarcity prevents full satisfaction of both claims, or whether housing reveals principled limits where contractualist justification reaches its bounds.

### Gap 4: Epistemic Duties in Planning

Intergenerational justice literature addresses preference uncertainty regarding future generations (Gosseries 2009, Timmer 2024), while epistemic justice literature examines testimonial and hermeneutical injustices against marginalized groups (Fricker 2007, Medina 2013, Anderson 2012). Yet their intersection—epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority—remains largely untheorized. Urban planning decisions create long-lived path dependencies through infrastructure, density patterns, and land use regulations that bind future generations irreversibly (McCauley et al. 2018), yet under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future preferences.

Zwarthoed (2016) and Doorn (2025) gesture toward option preservation under uncertainty, arguing we owe future generations adequate choice-sets rather than optimized outcomes based on predicted preferences. However, they do not develop full epistemic justice foundations for this duty. Fricker (2007) and Medina (2013) analyze how epistemic injustice wrongs people specifically as knowers through credibility deficits and lacking interpretive resources, yet focus on contemporaneous relationships. Anderson (2012) extends epistemic justice to institutional design, arguing institutions can exhibit epistemic injustice through systematically excluding voices or failing to correct bias, but does not address intergenerational contexts where future people cannot provide testimony.

Byskov and Hyams (2023) apply epistemic injustice to climate adaptation planning, showing how decision-making frameworks systematically privilege certain epistemic perspectives while marginalizing others. Halsband (2022) demonstrates that AI-supported optimization in long-term planning embeds contestable assumptions about future preferences, committing a form of hermeneutical injustice by imposing present interpretive frameworks on future generations who cannot contest them. Yet neither paper develops how epistemic duties to future knowers might constrain present planning authority regarding irreversible urban form decisions.

The relational egalitarian approach to intergenerational justice faces difficulties: Bengtson (2025) and Lippert-Rasmussen (2025) argue relational egalitarianism's "intergenerational justice dilemma" arises because non-overlapping generations lack social relations in the relevant sense, making it unclear how relational principles extend intergenerationally. Chan (2025) proposes that we owe future generations capacity to relate as equals by transforming oppressive social categories, yet this still requires some basis for cross-generational obligations. If relational approaches founder on temporal non-overlap, what alternative grounds intergenerational duties?

This gap matters because planning decisions that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities may wrong future generations in a distinctive way—not merely by failing to maximize their welfare, but by constraining their epistemic capacities to interpret and contest the arrangements they inherit. If we cannot know future preferences and our conceptual schemes may prove parochial, epistemic humility should constrain optimization-based planning. Yet standard contractualist frameworks inadequately theorize such epistemic constraints, focusing instead on hypothetical choice behind veils of ignorance (Rawls) or reasonable rejection given actual circumstances (Scanlon) that presume determinacy about what reasonable persons would accept.

**Research contribution**: This project develops epistemic duties to future generations as constraints on present planning authority, using epistemic justice frameworks (Fricker, Medina, Anderson) extended intergenerationally via capacity-preservation arguments (Chan). It examines whether epistemic approaches provide grounds for duties that do not require social relations or reciprocity, potentially succeeding where relational approaches fail. The argument contends that planning decisions constraining future generations' interpretive capacities through irreversible urban form constitute epistemic injustice requiring justification, yet such justification may be impossible under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future values.

### Gap 5: Housing's Dual Role Under Contractualism

Housing systems literature documents empirically that financialized homeownership creates a fundamental contradiction: housing must appreciate to serve as wealth store, yet appreciation systematically destroys affordability (Fikse and Aalbers 2020). Ryan-Collins (2019, 2021) traces the housing-finance feedback cycle created by pro-homeownership policy plus credit liberalization, where housing became the most attractive collateral for banks and most desirable asset for households, creating structural necessity for appreciation. Fuller et al. (2019) demonstrate that wealth inequality is now driven primarily by housing price dynamics, not income or homeownership rates, because appreciation enriches owners while excluding non-owners. Christophers (2019) argues tenure inequality—systematic privileging of ownership over rental—is the root cause of housing wealth inequality.

Property-owning democracy literature addresses dispersed ownership abstractly, arguing POD prevents domination and secures opportunity through predistribution (O'Neill and Williamson 2012, Freeman 2013, Thomas 2016). Freeman (2018) emphasizes democratic reciprocity and self-respect as central to POD, not merely distributive patterns. Erck (2024) develops housing limitarianism within POD framework, arguing for wealth ceilings on housing ownership. Yet Gregory (2016) shows empirically that homeownership-based POD has failed egalitarian aims, creating anti-egalitarian dynamics as housing appreciation concentrates wealth. Halliday and Meyer (2024) observe philosophical literature has inadequately addressed macroeconomic dimensions of housing and price dynamics.

No work systematically examines whether any housing price policy can meet contractualist reasonable acceptance standards when housing serves this dual role. If housing must function simultaneously as affordable necessity and wealth store under financialized conditions, yet appreciation undermines affordability while suppression attacks security, can any policy satisfy reasonable rejection criteria for all affected parties? Consider the dilemma from each position:

From incumbent owners' perspective: Housing often constitutes households' primary asset, particularly for middle-class and working-class homeowners. Policies suppressing housing values (to improve affordability for newcomers) attack the asset-based security POD aims to provide. Since POD justifies dispersed property ownership partly to secure independence and self-respect (Freeman 2018), owners could reasonably reject principles that deliberately undermine their main asset's value. The "really big contradiction" (Fikse and Aalbers 2020) suggests that once housing becomes financialized as wealth store, policies attacking appreciation may be unreasonably burdensome to those who relied on housing as retirement security or intergenerational wealth transfer.

From excluded newcomers' perspective: Housing appreciation that enriches incumbent owners necessarily prices out potential newcomers, particularly low-wealth households. If location provides non-exportable productivity gains through agglomeration (Hsieh and Moretti 2019), exclusion from high-productivity cities imposes unreasonable opportunity costs. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing costs redirected low-skill workers away from opportunity-rich locations, ending income convergence. Excluded workers could reasonably reject principles allowing housing appreciation that systematically concentrates opportunity among incumbents while denying access to those who would benefit most. The dual-role structure makes appreciation-enabling policies unreasonably burdensome to excluded outsiders.

This creates a contractualist impasse: neither appreciation nor suppression can satisfy reasonable acceptance by both owners and non-owners when housing functions simultaneously as necessity and asset. POD literature has not examined this tension: can property-owning democracy be achieved through dispersed homeownership when that very dispersion creates dual-role contradictions? Gregory's (2016) empirical finding that homeownership-based POD failed egalitarian aims suggests the structural problem, yet no philosophical analysis examines whether this failure reflects principled limits of contractualist justification rather than merely implementation challenges.

Kemeny's (1981) distinction between dualist and unitary housing systems suggests structural design choices may affect whether dual-role tension is tractable. Dualist systems (where social rental is residualized and competes with homeownership) may intensify contradictions by making homeownership the only secure tenure. Unitary systems (where non-profit and private rental compete, with homeownership less dominant) may ease tension by providing quality rental alternatives, allowing housing to serve necessity function without requiring appreciation. Yet philosophical literature has not examined whether tenure neutrality (Christophers 2019) or system-level design can resolve contractualist justifiability problems, or whether dual-role contradictions persist across system types under financialized conditions.

**Research contribution**: This project tests POD against contractualist justifiability standards when applied to housing, showing that dual-role problems create principled impasses where neither appreciation nor suppression satisfies reasonable rejection criteria for all affected parties. It examines whether any institutional design—POD via homeownership, POD via alternative asset forms, unitary rental systems with tenure neutrality, or hybrid approaches—can mediate this tension under financialized conditions. The analysis reveals whether housing's dual role represents merely difficult trade-offs requiring institutional ingenuity, or principled limits to contractualist justification where no arrangements can be justified to all affected parties.

### Synthesis and Research Positioning

These five gaps collectively reveal that housing justice requires distinctive theoretical treatment beyond general distributive principles. Housing's non-fungible location-specific value, competing occupancy and access claims, dual-role contradictions, and irreversible path dependencies binding future generations create challenges that standard contractualist frameworks inadequately address. The gaps are not merely empirical (we need more data) or applied (we need better policies), but theoretical: existing normative frameworks lack resources for goods where value is location-constituted, where protecting some necessarily excludes others, where necessity and asset functions contradict, and where epistemic uncertainty about future preferences constrains present optimization.

This research contributes by: (1) applying contractualist frameworks systematically to housing, examining both Rawlsian political contractualism and Scanlonian moral contractualism regarding housing's distinctive features; (2) integrating empirical evidence on agglomeration and financialization with normative contractualist analysis, showing how location-specific productivity gains and dual-role contradictions create justification challenges; (3) framing occupancy/access as contractualist impasse requiring principles justifiable to both incumbents and excluded outsiders, not merely incumbent protection; (4) developing epistemic duties for intergenerational planning through extending epistemic justice frameworks to future generations via capacity-preservation arguments; and (5) testing POD's limits when housing serves dual roles, examining whether appreciation or suppression can satisfy reasonable rejection criteria.

The expected contribution is not a comprehensive solution to housing justice—the four failings documented suggest contractualism may reach principled limits in housing contexts. Rather, the project aims for clearer analysis of where contractualist justification succeeds, where it faces difficulties, and what normative resources (from capabilities, rights, or relational frameworks) might supplement contractualist principles. If housing reveals that some policies cannot be justified to all affected parties because legitimate claims conflict irreducibly, this clarifies both contractualism's scope and housing's distinctive moral status. Understanding these limits is itself a significant contribution, revealing what housing justice requires beyond contractualist tools and what institutional innovations might address dual-role contradictions, occupancy/access trade-offs, and intergenerational epistemic duties that contractualism alone cannot resolve.
