====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers the core framework of contractualist moral and political philosophy, particularly Rawlsian contractualism and Scanlonian contractualism. The central debate concerns the structure and requirements of justification in political arrangements. Rawls's framework centers on the original position, the veil of ignorance, and the two principles of justice—equal basic liberties and the difference principle. His account of primary goods as the metric for distributive justice establishes a "thin theory of the good" that aims to be neutral among reasonable conceptions of the good life. Scanlon's contractualism, by contrast, focuses on interpersonal moral obligations grounded in reasonable rejectability—an act is wrong if it violates principles no one could reasonably reject. Recent work has explored tensions between these accounts, particularly regarding aggregation, the scope of moral concern, and the adequate ground for distributive requirements.

Key debates include: (1) whether contractualist frameworks adequately ground distributive justice or merely procedural constraints; (2) the relationship between Rawls's political constructivism and Scanlon's moral contractualism; (3) whether the thin theory of primary goods sufficiently captures what citizens need to pursue their life plans; and (4) how contractualist principles apply to non-ideal circumstances, including state coercion and non-voluntary participation in social cooperation.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational to the housing-justice research project because it establishes the justifiability requirements for state coercion. The project's critique of Rawlsian contractualism on housing requires understanding: (1) how primary goods abstract from particular attachments like place; (2) what counts as a justifiable inequality under the difference principle; (3) when thin theories fail to resolve substantive policy questions; and (4) the limits of hypothetical consent in legitimating actual coercion over housing and land.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature on contractualism and housing/land is surprisingly sparse. Most applications focus on healthcare, global justice, or abstract distributive principles. There is minimal engagement with contractualist justifications for property regimes, land use regulation, or housing policy—precisely the domains where state coercion is most direct and affects fundamental interests in place and stability.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish between Rawlsian political contractualism (focused on basic structure) and Scanlonian moral contractualism (focused on interpersonal obligations). It should also trace how the primary goods framework abstracts from particular goods like housing and place-attachment, setting up the project's critique of this fungibility assumption.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Rawlsian Justice as Fairness: 8 papers - Original position, primary goods, difference principle
- Scanlonian Reasonable Rejection: 5 papers - Interpersonal justifiability, reasonable rejectability
- Critics of Thin Theories: 5 papers - Capabilities approach, limits of abstraction

@book{rawls1971theory,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {A Theory of Justice},
  year = {1971},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  isbn = {9780674000780},
  doi = {10.4159/9780674042605},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls presents justice as fairness, arguing that principles of justice should be chosen from behind a "veil of ignorance" in an "original position" where parties do not know their particular circumstances. From this position, rational agents would choose two principles: (1) equal basic liberties for all, and (2) inequalities are permissible only if they benefit the least advantaged (difference principle) and are attached to positions open under fair equality of opportunity. The theory uses "primary goods"—rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, and self-respect—as the metric for distributive justice, assuming these goods are valuable whatever one's conception of the good life.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for the research project. The housing-justice critique challenges several Rawlsian assumptions: (1) that primary goods like income and wealth are fungible and interchangeable; (2) that the framework adequately captures non-fungible goods like stable housing and place-attachment; (3) that the thin theory of the good can resolve questions about housing as necessity versus asset; and (4) that the hypothetical consent of the original position legitimates actual coercion over housing and land. Rawls's account establishes the contractualist baseline the project critiques.

  POSITION: Foundational Rawlsian contractualism; establishes primary goods framework and difference principle as core distributive requirements.

@book{rawls1993political,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {Political Liberalism},
  year = {1993},
  publisher = {Columbia University Press},
  address = {New York},
  isbn = {9780231130882},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls revises his theory of justice to address the fact of reasonable pluralism in democratic societies. He argues that justice as fairness should be understood as a "political" rather than "comprehensive" doctrine—it does not depend on any particular conception of the good life. The legitimacy of political power requires that it be exercisable in accordance with principles all reasonable citizens could endorse through "public reason." This work introduces the idea of an "overlapping consensus" among reasonable comprehensive doctrines and clarifies that primary goods are specified for free and equal citizens cooperating in a well-ordered society.

  RELEVANCE: This text is crucial for understanding the scope and limits of contractualist justification. The housing-justice project engages with Rawls's claim that primary goods are "neutral" and can command overlapping consensus. The critique argues that seemingly neutral principles about housing fungibility actually presuppose contestable views about attachment, stability, and the good life—views that particular communities (e.g., those facing displacement) could reasonably reject. Political Liberalism also clarifies the "burdens of judgment" that explain reasonable disagreement, which the project applies to disagreements about housing policy.

  POSITION: Refined Rawlsian political constructivism; shifts from comprehensive to political doctrine; emphasizes public reason and overlapping consensus.

@book{scanlon1998owe,
  author = {Scanlon, Thomas M.},
  title = {What We Owe to Each Other},
  year = {1998},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  isbn = {9780674004238},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon develops a contractualist moral theory distinct from Rawls's political theory. An act is wrong if it would be disallowed by principles that no one could reasonably reject, insofar as they are motivated to find principles for mutual recognition and governance. "Reasonable rejection" is the core concept: to determine what principles govern our conduct toward each other, we must ask what objections individuals could raise to proposed principles given their particular circumstances and burdens. Unlike Rawls's hypothetical contract, Scanlon's contractualism is a substantive claim about the basis of interpersonal moral obligation—wrongness consists in treating others in ways not justifiable to them.

  RELEVANCE: Scanlon's framework provides an alternative contractualist approach that may better address the housing-justice project's concerns. His emphasis on justifiability to each particular person (rather than generic rational choosers behind a veil) suggests that policies affecting housing and place-attachment must be justifiable to those actually burdened—not merely to hypothetical agents ignorant of their attachments. The project can draw on Scanlon's account of reasonable rejection to argue that housing policies treating occupancy as fungible with financial compensation fail to respect what individuals in particular circumstances could reasonably object to. However, Scanlon's framework raises questions about scope: does it ground requirements of distributive justice or only interpersonal moral obligations?

  POSITION: Scanlonian moral contractualism; emphasizes reasonable rejectability and interpersonal justification; distinct from Rawls's political contractualism.

  editor = {Olsaretti, Serena},
  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  pages = {34--59},
  doi = {10.1093/OXFORDHB/9780199645121.013.2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Freeman provides the authoritative analysis of Rawls's difference principle, clarifying its requirements and scope. He explains that the difference principle requires economic systems to be organized so the least advantaged are better off than in any alternative arrangement. Freeman distinguishes the principle's "broad" requirements (institutional framework) from "narrow" requirements (specific policies), and argues it is a reciprocity principle—not a prioritarian principle focused solely on the worst off. He also defends "property-owning democracy" over welfare-state capitalism as better satisfying Rawls's principles, because it prevents massive inequalities in wealth that undermine fair value of political liberties and fair equality of opportunity.

  RELEVANCE: Freeman's analysis is essential for understanding what the difference principle requires regarding housing and property. The housing-justice project can draw on Freeman's distinction between broad and narrow requirements to argue that housing policy sits at the institutional level where the difference principle directly applies. His discussion of property-owning democracy versus welfare-state capitalism illuminates how property regimes affect distributive justice. The project critiques whether treating housing as just another primary good (fungible with income/wealth) truly maximizes the position of the least advantaged when considering stability, community, and place-attachment—dimensions Freeman's analysis does not address.

  POSITION: Contemporary Rawlsian scholarship; defends difference principle as reciprocity principle; advocates property-owning democracy.

@article{miller2021sidgwick,
  author = {Miller, David},
  title = {Sidgwick and Rawls on Distributive Justice and Desert},
  journal = {Politics, Philosophy \& Economics},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {20},
  number = {4},
  pages = {385--408},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X211036088},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller critically examines Rawls's rejection of desert as a principle of distributive justice, comparing it to Sidgwick's parallel move. He argues that both philosophers' anti-desert arguments rest on contestable conceptual or metaphysical claims that conflict with their methodological commitments to reflective equilibrium and common-sense convictions. Miller distinguishes three levels of anti-desert arguments: (1) fundamental defects in the concept of desert; (2) inability to find a coherent basis for desert; (3) institutional impossibility of rewarding desert. He finds all these arguments unsound and suggests Rawls's substitute principles (legitimate entitlement under just institutions) capture only part of what desert conveys and may not adequately address popular convictions about justice.

  RELEVANCE: This article is relevant because the housing-justice project's critique of fungibility implicitly appeals to something like desert or earned entitlement to place and stability—attachments that arise through occupancy and community participation. Miller's analysis suggests that Rawls's framework may inadequately account for intuitions about what people deserve based on their actual choices and contributions. The project can use this analysis to argue that treating housing as fungible (exchangeable for money) ignores legitimate bases for attachment that arise from occupancy—bases that contractualism should recognize even if they don't fit the primary goods framework.

  POSITION: Critical of Rawls's rejection of desert; argues common-sense convictions support desert-based considerations in distributive justice.

@article{andersson2022distributive,

  title = {Distributive Justice, Social Cooperation, and the Basis of Equality},
  journal = {Theoria},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {88},
  number = {6},
  pages = {1375--1391},
  doi = {10.1111/theo.12433},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andersson defends Rawls's account of moral personality as the basis of equality in distributive justice against common criticisms. He argues that critics fail to appreciate that Rawls's account is specifically restricted to the domain of distributive justice, understood as the fair terms of cooperation among participants in a system of social cooperation. On this view, distributive justice concerns not all moral relations but specifically the division of benefits and burdens of social cooperation. Andersson contends that this domain-specific understanding provides a compelling rationale for moral personality (the capacity for a sense of justice and conception of the good) as the basis of equal standing, because varying natural capacities beyond this threshold are morally arbitrary for determining fair terms of cooperation.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the scope and basis of Rawlsian distributive justice, which is crucial for the housing-justice project. If distributive justice specifically concerns fair terms of social cooperation, the question becomes: what role do housing and land play in the cooperative scheme? The project can use Andersson's analysis to ask whether treating housing as fungible respects equal moral personality or instead privileges those with liquid assets over those whose "primary goods" are tied up in place and community. The social cooperation frame also raises questions about how to treat those who don't voluntarily participate in housing markets but face coercion (eminent domain, displacement).

  POSITION: Defends Rawlsian equality basis; emphasizes moral personality and social cooperation framework for distributive justice.

@article{stensen2022envy,
  author = {Stensen, Vegard},
  title = {Envy, Self-Esteem, and Distributive Justice},
  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {23},
  number = {2},
  pages = {320--339},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851221125572},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stensen argues against the conventional view that envy should have no role in distributive justice. Drawing on Rawls's and Honneth's concerns about the social bases of self-esteem/self-respect, he contends that certain forms of envy involve harms to self-esteem that a just society should prevent. Stensen distinguishes between irrational malicious envy and rational envy regarding opportunities for social esteem, arguing that preventing the latter is consistent with commitments to protecting self-respect. He defends envy-avoidance against three objections: that envy is always irrational, that preventing it is unfair, and that it is unreasonable to accommodate due to envy's antisocial nature.

  RELEVANCE: This article is highly relevant to housing-justice arguments about dignity and self-respect. Rawls identifies self-respect as "perhaps the most important primary good," yet the primary goods framework may inadequately protect it when housing instability or displacement undermine individuals' sense of standing in the community. Stensen's analysis supports examining how housing policies affect self-esteem and social bases of self-respect—dimensions that monetary compensation may fail to restore. The project can argue that treating housing as fungible with money ignores how housing stability supports self-respect through community membership, a concern Rawls's framework should accommodate but inadequately operationalizes.

  POSITION: Extends Rawlsian concerns about self-respect; argues envy-avoidance is relevant to distributive justice when envy harms self-esteem.

@article{pettit2012legitimacy,

  volume = {65},
  number = {1},
  pages = {59--82},
  doi = {10.1093/clp/cus016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pettit distinguishes legitimacy (how coercion is imposed) from justice (what social order is imposed) and argues legitimacy is a distinct concern requiring its own justification. The core legitimacy question is showing how state coercion is consistent with people being free citizens. Pettit rejects social contract theories that ground legitimacy in actual or hypothetical consensus, arguing instead that republican freedom as non-domination provides the key. State coercion is legitimate when it does not dominate—when it is controlled by those subject to it through contestatory democratic institutions. This legitimacy does not require showing the state exists by contract, only that its power is non-arbitrary.

  RELEVANCE: Pettit's account is crucial for the housing-justice project's critique of contractualist justifications for coercion. If legitimacy and justice are distinct, hypothetical consent in the original position may not legitimate actual state coercion over housing and land—even if that coercion serves distributive justice. The project can use Pettit's framework to argue that housing policies (eminent domain, zoning, displacement) require contestatory justification to actual affected parties, not merely conformity to principles that hypothetical agents would choose. His republican emphasis on non-domination also suggests examining whether housing policies create arbitrary power relations that primary goods frameworks fail to capture.

  editor = {Sen, Amartya and Williams, Bernard},
  year = {1982},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  pages = {103--128},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon introduces his contractualist moral theory as an alternative to utilitarianism. He argues that thinking about right and wrong is fundamentally about what we can justify to others on grounds they could not reasonably reject. This contrasts with utilitarian aggregation of individual well-being. Contractualism respects the "separateness of persons" by requiring that principles be justifiable to each person affected, not merely maximize overall welfare. Scanlon distinguishes his view from social contract theories focused on mutual advantage and self-interest (Hobbes, Gauthier), emphasizing instead the moral motivation to justify oneself to others.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational essay establishes key themes Scanlon later develops in What We Owe to Each Other. For the housing-justice project, it introduces the "reasonable rejection" criterion that offers an alternative to Rawls's original position. Housing policies that treat occupancy as fungible with compensation might be reasonably rejectable by those whose attachments to place and community are disrupted—even if such policies satisfy the difference principle. The essay's emphasis on justification to each person (versus aggregation or hypothetical choice) provides conceptual resources for the project's critique of treating diverse goods as commensurable.

  volume = {110},
  number = {4},
  pages = {563--586},
  doi = {10.1215/00318108-110-4-563},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Adams provides a sympathetic but critical assessment of Scanlon's contractualism. He praises Scanlon's development of a comprehensive theory that takes individual interests fairly into account while rejecting aggregative consequentialism. Adams examines Scanlon's account of wrongness in terms of reasonable rejectability and explores how Scanlon's theory handles cases of conflicting interests. He raises questions about the scope of contractualist moral reasoning—whether it captures all of morality or only what we owe to each other—and about how to determine what counts as a reasonable rejection versus an unreasonable demand.

  RELEVANCE: Adams's critical notice illuminates both strengths and limitations of Scanlonian contractualism for the housing-justice project. His discussion of scope is particularly relevant: if contractualism concerns only interpersonal moral obligations, does it ground requirements of distributive justice (including housing rights)? Or must distributive justice rest on a different foundation (like Rawls's political contractualism)? Adams's analysis of reasonable rejection criteria is also important for determining when housing policies that treat place-attachment as tradeable could be reasonably rejected—and what standards govern this determination.

  number = {2},
  pages = {243--291},
  doi = {10.1007/S11098-005-2216-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reidy examines how Rawlsian political liberalism handles reasonable disagreement and develops an account of democratic legitimacy based on reciprocity. He argues that political power is legitimate when exercised according to principles all reasonable citizens could reciprocally endorse through public reason, despite their reasonable disagreements about comprehensive doctrines. Reidy analyzes the structure of reasonable disagreement, the duty of civility, and how democratic procedures can produce legitimate outcomes even when citizens reasonably disagree about justice. He emphasizes that reciprocity requires more than mutual advantage—it requires respecting others as free and equal moral persons.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the justificatory structure of Rawlsian contractualism and its handling of reasonable pluralism, which is crucial for housing-justice arguments. The project engages with how seemingly neutral principles about housing fungibility actually presuppose contestable comprehensive views. Reidy's analysis of reciprocity and reasonable disagreement helps frame the question: could reasonable citizens reject principles treating housing as fungible, given reasonable disagreements about place-attachment, community stability, and the good life? His emphasis on reciprocity among equals (not mere mutual advantage) also supports examining whether housing policies respect moral equality or instead privilege mobile over rooted citizens.

  number = {3},
  pages = {283--304},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X030023001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wenar applies Scanlonian contractualism to questions of global justice and duties to distant strangers. He argues that while Scanlon's framework successfully grounds strong duties of non-harm and rescue to identifiable individuals, it faces difficulties grounding positive duties of assistance to statistical lives and addressing structural injustice. Wenar examines whether contractualist principles can be extended beyond face-to-face interpersonal contexts to global institutional arrangements, comparing Scanlon's approach with Rawlsian and cosmopolitan alternatives. He suggests that contractualism's emphasis on justifiability to each person may require supplementation for questions of distributive justice at scale.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on global justice, Wenar's analysis illuminates broader questions about contractualism's scope and grounding for distributive requirements. The housing-justice project faces parallel challenges: if contractualism grounds interpersonal moral obligations, does it also ground institutional requirements regarding housing distribution? Or must housing justice rely on different (perhaps Rawlsian political) foundations? Wenar's discussion of structural versus interpersonal injustice is relevant because housing policy operates at both levels—individual displacement decisions and systemic property regimes—and contractualism may handle these differently.

  volume = {109},
  number = {4},
  pages = {766--779},
  doi = {10.1017/s0003055415000490},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Valentini develops a "social samaritan" theory distinguishing when duties to assist the needy are enforceable demands of justice versus non-enforceable beneficence. She rejects the common view that bodily service provision is non-enforceable while resource transfers are enforceable. Instead, she argues that within political communities, duties to help the needy—whether via services or resources—are always enforceable justice demands except when the needy are reckless; across independent communities, they are always beneficence. She defends this alternative double standard based on shared social cooperation within but not across political communities.

  RELEVANCE: Valentini's framework is valuable for examining when and why housing assistance might be an enforceable right rather than discretionary policy. If citizens have enforceable justice-based claims to assistance within their political community, this might ground rights to stable housing as part of what co-citizens owe each other. The social cooperation framework also connects to Rawlsian themes: if housing is essential for participating in social cooperation, contractualist principles should ensure its adequate provision. However, the project may critique whether this adequately captures duties regarding housing when the "needy" arise from unjust displacement rather than bad luck.

  POSITION: Social samaritan theory; distinguishes enforceable justice from beneficence based on shared political community and social cooperation.

  doi = {10.1111/j.1747-9991.2009.00254.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Southwood provides a critical introduction to contractualism as a moral theory, focusing specifically on Scanlon's Kantian version. He elucidates four key features: (1) justifiability to others as the foundation of moral rightness and wrongness; (2) reasonable rejectability as the criterion for determining which principles are justifiable; (3) the individualist restriction—principles must be justifiable to each person affected, not merely promote overall good; and (4) mutual recognition—the moral motivation is a desire to relate to others on terms of mutual respect. Southwood also surveys major challenges to contractualism, including the scope problem, aggregation difficulties, and circularity objections.

  RELEVANCE: This overview article is valuable for situating the housing-justice project's use of contractualist frameworks. It clarifies the distinction between moral contractualism (Scanlon) and political contractualism (Rawls), which the project must navigate when applying contractualist principles to housing policy. Southwood's discussion of the individualist restriction is particularly relevant: housing policies affecting place-attachment and community must be justifiable to each affected person, not merely promote aggregate welfare or satisfy hypothetical contractors. The overview also flags key challenges—scope, aggregation, circularity—that the project must address when applying contractualism to housing questions.

  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  pages = {65--81},
  doi = {10.1515/mopp-2018-0057},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Giubilini and Savulescu examine when public health policies can justifiably require individuals to make personal sacrifices for community benefit. Drawing on demandingness objections in moral philosophy, they argue that states should primarily require actions individuals have independent moral obligations to perform, making coercive measures ethically justified especially when interventions also benefit the individuals. When policies require overly demanding sacrifices beyond moral obligation, states must provide incentives or compensation. They apply this framework to vaccination, antimicrobial resistance, and quarantine/isolation policies, arguing different policies demand different justificatory structures based on their burden on individuals.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on public health, this framework directly applies to housing and land use coercion. The housing-justice project can use the demandingness analysis to ask: when housing policies (eminent domain, exclusionary zoning, displacement) impose severe burdens on individuals for alleged community benefit, what justification is required? Do individuals have independent moral obligations to accept such burdens? If not, compensation or consent may be required. The article's emphasis on individual burden rather than aggregate utility aligns with contractualist individualist restrictions and provides tools for assessing when housing coercion exceeds legitimate demands.

  pages = {78--85},
  doi = {10.1136/medethics-2020-106821},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Savulescu develops an ethical algorithm for justified mandatory vaccination, arguing it can be defended when: (1) public health threat is grave; (2) safety/effectiveness confidence is high; (3) expected utility exceeds alternatives; and (4) penalties are proportionate. He proposes that under risk conditions, payment for vaccination may be ethically superior to mandates. Savulescu defends payment systems against objections that they constitute coercion or undermine solidarity, arguing payment can be cash or in-kind and preserves opportunity for altruistic choice. The analysis distinguishes genuine coercion from incentivization and examines when bodily autonomy can be overridden for public benefit.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides a detailed framework for assessing when state coercion is justified, which directly parallels the housing-justice project's concerns. Just as vaccination mandates raise questions about justified coercion over bodies, housing policies raise questions about justified coercion over place and property. Savulescu's proportionality analysis and compensation framework can be adapted: if housing coercion (eminent domain, displacement) is deemed necessary for public benefit, what compensation is required? The article's distinction between coercion and incentivization is also relevant for examining housing policies that "encourage" mobility through market mechanisms.

  journal = {Journal of Philosophy},
  year = {1980},
  volume = {77},
  number = {9},
  pages = {515--572},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls articulates his method of "Kantian constructivism," distinguishing it from both moral realism and radical relativism. The constructivist procedure uses the original position to model reasonable constraints on principles of justice, where principles are constructed through rational choice under specified conditions rather than discovered as independent moral facts. Rawls explains how his approach is "Kantian" in treating persons as free and equal moral persons with the capacity for a conception of the good and a sense of justice. He clarifies that primary goods are specified as what free and equal persons need as citizens, not simply as means to any ends, and argues this construction procedure yields objective practical truth within the domain of justice.

  RELEVANCE: This essay is foundational for understanding Rawls's contractualist methodology and its limitations. The housing-justice project engages with Rawls's constructivism by asking whether the constructed principles adequately account for goods like housing that resist the fungibility assumptions of primary goods. Rawls's specification of citizens as free and equal may presuppose a mobility and detachment from place that not all reasonable citizens share. The project can question whether the constructivist procedure—which abstracts from particular attachments in the original position—can adequately handle housing questions where particular attachments (to place, community, stability) are precisely what's at stake.

  POSITION: Methodological essay; articulates Kantian constructivism; explains primary goods and objectivity in justice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Scanlon provides a concise summary of his contractualist moral theory from What We Owe to Each Other. He reiterates that an action is wrong if it violates principles no one could reasonably reject, motivated by the aim of finding principles for mutual recognition. He emphasizes that contractualism offers an account of the nature of moral wrongness (not merely a decision procedure) and that reasonable rejectability is not reducible to other moral notions. Scanlon also clarifies how his view differs from Rawls's political contractualism—Scanlon's theory is about interpersonal morality whereas Rawls addresses political justice.

  RELEVANCE: This précis efficiently summarizes key commitments of Scanlonian contractualism that the housing-justice project engages with. The distinction from Rawls is particularly important: if Scanlon's framework governs interpersonal obligations while Rawls's governs political structure, which framework applies to housing policy? Housing operates at both levels—interpersonal (landlord-tenant, neighbor relations) and political (zoning, eminent domain, property law). The project must navigate this scope question when applying contractualist principles to housing coercion, potentially arguing that adequate housing policy requires coordination between both frameworks.

  POSITION: Concise restatement of Scanlonian contractualism; clarifies distinction from Rawlsian political contractualism.

DOMAIN: Non-Fungible Goods and Location-Specific Value

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how theories of distributive justice handle goods whose value is constitutively tied to location, context, or social meaning, challenging the fungibility assumption implicit in dominant frameworks. The fungibility assumption treats all goods as substitutable via a common metric (welfare, resources, capabilities), yet certain goods—particularly housing in specific locations—resist such commensuration.

Brighouse and Swift (2006) established that positional goods (whose value depends on relative standing) create convergence among egalitarian, prioritarian, and sufficientarian principles, suggesting that goods with inherent relational or positional features require distinct treatment. This insight extends to location-specific goods where value is constituted, not merely affected, by location. Walzer (1983) and Miller (1999) developed pluralist theories recognizing distinct spheres or contexts where different distributive principles apply, challenging monistic approaches. Anderson (1999) critiqued luck egalitarianism's focus on distributing neutral resources, arguing for democratic equality emphasizing capabilities and social relations.

The capabilities approach (Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2011) highlights conversion factors—personal, social, and environmental conditions that determine whether resources translate into capabilities. Location emerges as a critical conversion factor, but the literature has not fully theorized goods where location constitutes (rather than merely converts) value. Kymlicka (1989, 1995) argues cultural membership functions as a primary good, establishing precedent for non-fungible, context-dependent goods within liberal frameworks.

Recent work by Cass (2023) refines the positional goods debate, while Freiman (2014) explores tensions between priority and position. Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (2015) develops spatial justice theory, though philosophical integration with distributive justice remains underdeveloped.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the fungibility assumption central to the research project. If housing value is location-specific in a constitutive (not merely convertible) sense, then standard Rawlsian approaches premised on fungible primary goods may inadequately handle housing justice. The positional goods literature provides analytical tools for goods whose value depends on relational features, while capabilities approaches offer frameworks for context-dependent valuation. This literature establishes theoretical space for non-fungible goods within liberal justice without abandoning contractualism.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature addresses positional goods (relative ranking) and special goods (cultural, relational) but rarely examines location-specific value as a distinct category. Spatial justice theory remains disconnected from analytic distributive justice debates. Few papers explicitly challenge the fungibility assumption in Rawls or Dworkin, and none systematically explore housing as a non-fungible good.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish: (1) positional value (comparative), (2) contextual value (conversion-dependent), and (3) constitutive location-specific value. It should examine whether the fungibility assumption is explicit or implicit in primary goods/equality of resources frameworks, and whether capabilities approaches successfully escape it. The convergence thesis for positional goods (Brighouse & Swift, Cass) may extend to location-specific goods, suggesting that housing justice transcends standard egalitarian divisions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Monistic resource-based: 8 papers - Standard Rawlsian/Dworkinian approaches assuming fungible goods
- Pluralist/contextual: 6 papers - Walzer, Miller, capabilities approaches recognizing context-dependence
- Positional/relational: 4 papers - Brighouse & Swift, Cass, Freiman on goods whose value is inherently relational

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Positional goods—goods whose value depends on one's relative standing—generate convergence among typically competing distributive principles (egalitarianism, prioritarianism, sufficientarianism). When goods have positional aspects, equalizing distribution becomes instrumentally valuable even for non-egalitarians, since relative deprivation matters for welfare independent of absolute levels. The authors develop a taxonomy distinguishing goods that are positional in their nature (like status), in their value (like educational credentials), or in their effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes the theoretical framework for analyzing goods whose value is not purely absolute but depends on relational or contextual features. Location-specific housing value parallels positional goods: the value of living in a particular location partly depends on what others cannot access (exclusivity, proximity to opportunities). If housing is positional in Brighouse and Swift's sense, standard distributive principles may converge on more equal distribution than typically thought. The paper's distinction between nature, value, and effects provides analytical tools for characterizing location-specific value.

  POSITION: Pluralist/relational approach showing that goods with inherent relational features require distinct normative treatment, potentially bridging standard egalitarian divides.

  doi = {10.4324/9781315199795-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dworkin develops equality of resources as an alternative to welfare egalitarianism, using the hypothetical auction and insurance markets to determine fair distributions that are both endowment-insensitive and ambition-sensitive. Resources are distributed equally when no one prefers another's bundle to their own (envy test). The framework treats resources as fungible—tradeable and substitutable—allowing individuals to convert holdings into preferred bundles through market mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: Dworkin's equality of resources explicitly assumes fungibility: all resources can be compared, traded, and substituted via the auction mechanism. This makes his framework particularly revealing for examining the fungibility assumption. Location-specific goods that resist substitution (because value is constituted by location, not convertible) challenge the envy test and auction framework. If housing in location A provides irreplaceable value, then no other bundle may satisfy the envy test even if formally equivalent in resource terms. Dworkin's framework exposes how deeply fungibility assumptions structure resourcist approaches to justice.

  POSITION: Foundational resourcist approach explicitly premised on fungibility of goods via market mechanisms.

  doi = {10.1086/233897},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson critiques luck egalitarianism's focus on equalizing resources or welfare to compensate for brute luck, arguing it leads to objectionable conclusions (abandoning the imprudent, pitying the naturally disadvantaged) and misconceives equality's point. Democratic equality, by contrast, aims to ensure all citizens can function as equals in democratic society. Justice requires guaranteeing capabilities for democratic participation, not equalizing holdings or welfare. Democratic equality is capability-focused but relational: what matters is whether people can relate as equals, not metric equivalence of goods.

  RELEVANCE: Anderson's critique challenges the fungibility assumption from a different angle: if justice is about relational equality and capabilities for democratic functioning, not metric resource equivalence, then location-specific goods matter insofar as they enable or undermine equal standing. Housing in particular locations may be essential for democratic equality (access to employment, political participation, public goods) in ways that cannot be compensated through fungible resource redistribution. Her critique of the resourcist focus on "neutral resources" supports examining goods whose value is constituted by social and spatial context.

@book{sen1985commodities,

  title = {Commodities and Capabilities},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1985},
  doi = {10.2307/135247},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sen argues that evaluating well-being and justice requires focusing on capabilities (what people can do and be) rather than commodities (resources) or utilities (welfare). The same commodity bundle provides different capabilities depending on personal, social, and environmental conversion factors. A person's functioning depends not just on what resources they possess but on how effectively they can convert resources into valuable capabilities. This makes interpersonal comparisons based on resource holdings or utility inadequate.

  RELEVANCE: Sen's emphasis on conversion factors directly addresses context-dependence in how goods generate value. Location functions as a critical environmental conversion factor: the same housing unit provides radically different capabilities depending on location (access to employment, education, social networks, political participation). However, Sen's framework treats location as affecting conversion of resources into capabilities, not as constituting the good itself. The question remains whether location-specific value is merely a conversion factor issue or represents a deeper challenge to resource metrics. Sen's work provides tools for context-dependent valuation while potentially preserving a form of fungibility (capabilities as common metric).

  POSITION: Capability approach emphasizing conversion factors and context-dependence, offering alternative to resource metrics while potentially preserving capability-based commensurability.

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {2011},
  doi = {10.5860/choice.49-0784},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Nussbaum develops Sen's capabilities approach into a more determinate theory by specifying a list of central human capabilities that governments should secure for all citizens as a matter of justice. The list includes life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses/imagination/thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one's environment. Unlike Sen's deliberately open-ended approach, Nussbaum argues political liberalism requires threshold levels of specific capabilities. Capabilities are diverse and irreducible to a single metric.

  RELEVANCE: Nussbaum's rejection of metric equivalence across capabilities challenges fungibility assumptions more directly than Sen. If capabilities are incommensurable and each requires threshold protection, then goods essential for specific capabilities cannot be freely substituted. Housing location affects multiple Nussbaumian capabilities: affiliation (access to social networks, community), practical reason (access to employment, educational opportunities), control over environment (political participation, access to public goods). If location-constituted capabilities are irreducible, then housing in particular locations may not be fungible with other goods. Nussbaum's framework provides theoretical space for non-fungible goods while maintaining liberal commitments.

  publisher = {Basic Books},
  address = {New York},
  year = {1983},
  doi = {10.2307/2026330},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Walzer develops a pluralist theory where justice requires distributing different goods according to their distinct social meanings, not a single principle across all spheres. Different spheres (membership, security, welfare, money, education, political power, etc.) have internal logics determining appropriate distributive principles. Injustice occurs through "tyranny"—when success in one sphere (e.g., wealth) illegitimately converts to dominance in another (e.g., political power). Complex equality prevents domination by blocking conversions while allowing inequality within spheres.

  RELEVANCE: Walzer's pluralism directly challenges monistic approaches assuming fungible goods distributed by universal principles. Housing and location might constitute distinct spheres with internal distributive logic resistant to monetary conversion. If living in particular locations is a distinct good with social meaning (community membership, access to opportunities, political participation), then its distribution should follow principles appropriate to that sphere, not pure market allocation or generalized resource equality. Walzer's anti-conversion principle particularly resonates: wealth should not automatically convert to exclusive spatial access. However, his conventionalism (social meanings determine justice) may conflict with critical evaluation of existing spatial inequalities.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach treating different goods as belonging to distinct spheres with sphere-specific distributive principles, resisting cross-sphere fungibility.

  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1999},
  doi = {10.4159/9780674266117},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller defends contextual pluralism: different principles of justice (desert, need, equality) apply in different contexts of human association. Solidaristic communities distribute by need, instrumental associations by desert, citizenship by equality. Unlike Walzer's social-meaning pluralism, Miller grounds contextual principles in the nature of relationships rather than existing conventions, allowing critical distance from status quo distributions. The principles are plural but not arbitrary—they derive from the conditions that make different forms of association possible and valuable.

  RELEVANCE: Miller's contextual approach provides a framework for examining whether location-specific goods require distinct distributive principles based on the form of association location enables. If housing in particular locations constitutes membership in local communities (solidaristic), provides access to employment (instrumental), or enables political participation (citizenship), different principles might apply depending on which relational context dominates. Miller's critical pluralism avoids Walzer's conservatism while rejecting monistic fungibility assumptions. His work supports treating housing/location as potentially subject to need-based or equality-based principles in civic contexts, even if market desert principles govern other goods.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach grounding different distributive principles in distinct forms of social relations, offering critical distance from conventions while resisting monism.

  number = {3},
  pages = {501--520},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-023-09581-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass examines and refines the "convergence thesis" (from Brighouse and Swift 2006) that egalitarians, prioritarians, and sufficientarians converge on favoring equal distribution of positional goods. She shows the thesis faces problems when applied to education and wealth, but succeeds for civic status—the central concern of relational or "social" egalitarianism. Relational equality requires equal civic status, which is inherently positional: one's standing as a citizen partly depends on how one ranks relative to others. Thus even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality must favor relatively equal distributions of goods affecting civic status.

  RELEVANCE: Cass's refined convergence thesis has direct implications for housing and location. If access to particular locations affects civic status (enabling political participation, access to public institutions, community membership), then even non-egalitarians committed to relational equality should favor less unequal spatial distributions than market outcomes typically produce. Housing location is plausibly positional in Cass's sense: extreme residential segregation by income creates civic status hierarchies incompatible with relational equality. This suggests housing/location justice may transcend standard egalitarian/prioritarian divisions, providing grounds for state intervention in housing markets that appeal across distributive frameworks.

  POSITION: Refined relational egalitarian approach showing positional aspects of civic status generate convergence on relatively equal distribution, with implications for goods affecting social standing.

  number = {2},
  pages = {341--360},
  doi = {10.1007/S11098-013-0099-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Freiman argues that prioritarianism—the view that benefiting people matters more the worse off they are—faces difficulties handling positional goods. Prioritarianism focuses on absolute welfare levels, but positional goods' value depends on relative standing. When goods are positional, increasing everyone's absolute level may not improve anyone's situation (if relative positions unchanged), yet prioritarianism would count this as an improvement. Conversely, equalizing positional goods by leveling down (reducing everyone's position equally) might improve relative standing despite reducing absolute welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Freiman's critique exposes tensions between priority-based approaches and goods with inherent relational value. If housing location is positional (value depending on relative access, exclusivity, or status), then prioritarian arguments for improving the absolute housing situations of the worst-off may miss the relational dimension. Simply building more housing in currently underserved areas doesn't address positional value if relative hierarchy persists. This suggests location-specific goods may require explicitly egalitarian (not just prioritarian) treatment, or recognition that positional aspects generate distinct normative considerations irreducible to absolute welfare levels.

  POSITION: Critical examination of prioritarianism's difficulty handling positional goods, suggesting relational features may require distinct normative principles.

@book{kymlicka1989liberalism,
  author = {Kymlicka, Will},
  title = {Liberalism, Community, and Culture},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1989},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka argues that cultural membership should be recognized as a primary good in the Rawlsian sense—something every rational person has reason to want regardless of their particular conception of the good. Cultural membership provides the context of choice within which individuals form and pursue life plans. Without access to a rich cultural structure, individual autonomy is severely compromised. Therefore, liberal justice requires protecting minority cultures through group-differentiated rights, contrary to traditional liberal neutrality.

  RELEVANCE: Kymlicka establishes precedent within liberal frameworks for goods that are context-dependent and not straightforwardly fungible. Cultural membership cannot be compensated through generic resources because it provides irreplaceable context for choice and identity. This parallels the argument that location provides irreplaceable context: particular locations constitute access to communities, employment networks, public institutions, and social capital that cannot be replicated elsewhere. If Rawlsian frameworks can accommodate cultural membership as a special good, they potentially can accommodate location-specific goods. Kymlicka's argument provides a model for expanding primary goods beyond fungible resources without abandoning contractualism.

  title = {Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1995},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka extends his earlier work on cultural membership to develop a comprehensive liberal theory of minority rights, distinguishing between national minorities (distinct cultural communities) and ethnic groups (immigrants). He argues for group-differentiated citizenship rights including self-government rights for national minorities, polyethnic rights for ethnic groups, and special representation rights. Cultural structure is an essential primary good that provides the context within which individuals make meaningful choices about how to lead their lives.

  RELEVANCE: Kymlicka's mature theory further develops how liberal frameworks can accommodate goods that are context-dependent, collective, and not fungible with generic resources. The parallel to location is strong: just as cultural communities are territorially situated and provide irreplaceable context for meaningful choice, particular locations provide irreplaceable access to opportunities, communities, and ways of life. Kymlicka's framework suggests justice requires not just resource redistribution but securing access to context-providing goods. This has implications for housing justice: if particular locations function analogously to cultural structures in providing essential context, then justice may require ensuring access rather than merely compensating through fungible resources.

@book{rawls1971theory,
  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {A Theory of Justice},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1971},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls develops justice as fairness, arguing principles of justice would be chosen by rational agents behind a veil of ignorance. The principles include equal basic liberties and the difference principle (inequalities permitted only if they benefit the least advantaged). Primary social goods—things every rational person wants regardless of their life plan (rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, self-respect)—provide the metric for distributive justice. The focus on primary goods rather than welfare allows public, objective comparisons while respecting plurality of conceptions of the good.

  RELEVANCE: Rawls's primary goods approach implicitly treats goods as fungible in two senses: (1) they can be measured and compared via an index, and (2) inequalities in one good can be justified by benefits in another (via the difference principle). The question is whether housing in particular locations fits the primary goods framework or resists it. Location might affect multiple primary goods (opportunities, income, perhaps self-respect), but if location-specific value is irreducible to these metrics, the framework faces challenges. Examining Rawls closely reveals whether fungibility is explicit or implicit, and whether the framework has resources to handle non-fungible goods.

  author = {Rawls, John},
  title = {Justice as Fairness: A Restatement},
  journal = {Philosophy and Public Affairs},
  year = {2001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rawls reformulates and clarifies justice as fairness, addressing criticisms and developing the political conception more fully. He refines the list of primary goods, emphasizing their role as an index of citizens' expectations regarding distribution of basic rights and socio-economic benefits. Primary goods are all-purpose means useful for realizing a wide range of conceptions of the good. The index weights basic liberties most heavily, followed by opportunities, then income and wealth. Rawls clarifies that primary goods are what free and equal citizens need qua citizens.

  RELEVANCE: The restatement provides Rawls's mature view on primary goods, making explicit features that were implicit in the original theory. The "all-purpose means" characterization reinforces fungibility: primary goods are valuable precisely because they're instrumentally useful across diverse life plans, not for constitutive value tied to particular contexts. This makes the framework particularly revealing for location-specific goods: if housing location has non-instrumental, context-specific value, it may not fit the all-purpose means model. However, Rawls's emphasis on what citizens "need qua citizens" might provide opening for location-based civic participation arguments.

  editor = {Brighouse, Harry and Robeyns, Ingrid},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume systematically compares primary goods and capabilities approaches to measuring justice. Contributors debate whether Rawlsian primary goods or Sen/Nussbaum capabilities better serve as the metric for distributive justice. Key debates include: Do capabilities' emphasis on conversion factors handle diversity better? Do primary goods provide more workable public metrics? Can the approaches be reconciled or are they fundamentally opposed? Essays by Anderson, Arneson, Pogge, and others map the terrain.

  RELEVANCE: The volume provides comprehensive treatment of the central debate for this research: what metric should guide distributive justice, and can either approach handle goods whose value is context-dependent or location-specific? The conversion factors debate is particularly relevant: capabilities theorists argue primary goods fail to account for how personal and social circumstances affect what people can do with resources. Location functions as a key conversion factor, but the question remains whether this exhausts location's normative significance or whether location-constituted value poses deeper problems for both approaches.

  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos develops spatial justice theory examining how law, space, and bodies mutually constitute each other. Space is not a neutral container for social relations but actively produces and is produced by legal, social, and material practices. Spatial justice requires attending to how laws create atmospheric conditions that enable or constrain embodied existence in particular locations. The lawscape concept captures how legal norms are spatially materialized and how spatial arrangements embody legal relations.

  RELEVANCE: This work develops spatial justice as a distinct theoretical framework, though it remains largely disconnected from analytic distributive justice debates. The emphasis on space's constitutive role (not merely as location for pre-existing activities) parallels the argument that location-specific value is constituted by rather than merely converted through location. However, the continental theoretical approach, emphasis on affect and atmosphere, and resistance to principles-based frameworks make direct integration with contractualist justice difficult. The work establishes that spatial justice is an active research area but highlights the disconnect between geographic/continental and analytic/distributive approaches.

  doi = {10.1177/1470594X09105390},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller examines how political boundaries affect justice, arguing that special obligations to co-nationals are compatible with cosmopolitan duties. The scope and content of justice principles vary depending on whether people share citizenship, economic cooperation, or mere humanity. Co-nationals share thicker obligations grounded in political community, while the global scope encompasses thinner humanitarian duties. Physical proximity and territorial boundaries matter normatively because they structure different forms of association.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on international justice, Miller's argument that boundaries and territories structure different normative obligations has implications for domestic spatial justice. If different locales constitute different forms of association (neighborhoods, municipalities, regions), this might ground location-specific obligations and claims. The argument that physical proximity and territorial arrangements aren't merely empirical facts but normatively significant connects to debates about whether location-specific value warrants distinct treatment. However, Miller doesn't develop implications for housing or domestic spatial distribution.

  doi = {10.1017/s0266267125100424},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Tyssedal argues that the philosophical literature has misinterpreted Fred Hirsch's original concept of positional goods. Hirsch defined positional goods as scarce goods that are fixed or near-fixed in supply, not (as Brighouse and Swift interpret) goods whose value depends on relative ranking. This distinction matters: Hirsch's concept has different explanatory power for understanding economic growth limits and social conflicts. The supply-based definition is more basic and useful than the ranking-based definition dominant in philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This conceptual clarification matters for analyzing housing and location. On Hirsch's original definition, location in desirable areas is positional because spatial supply is fixed: there's only so much beachfront property, proximity to city centers, or access to elite school districts. No amount of economic growth increases supply of these locations, unlike manufactured goods. On Brighouse/Swift's ranking definition, location is positional only if value depends on relative standing. The supply-based definition more directly captures why location-specific goods resist fungibility: you cannot produce more of them, regardless of resource availability. This supports treating location-specific goods as special cases requiring distinct distributive treatment.

  POSITION: Conceptual analysis recovering supply-based definition of positional goods, with implications for goods with fixed spatial supply.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass argues that relational or "social" equality is distinct from distributive equality and has distinctive positional and temporal dimensions. Relational equality concerns equal civic status—the absence of hierarchical social relations—rather than metric equality of goods. Civic status is inherently positional (depends on relative standing) and diachronic (unfolds over time). This makes relational equality conceptually independent from distributive principles while having implications for distribution: maintaining equal civic status constrains permissible distributive inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Cass's argument that relational equality has distinctive positional dimensions directly applies to housing and spatial justice. Extreme residential segregation by income, race, or class creates hierarchical civic status incompatible with relational equality even if absolute standards are met. The temporal dimension matters too: cumulative residential segregation across generations compounds status hierarchies. If housing location affects civic status (access to political participation, public goods, community membership), then relational equality requires constraining spatial inequalities beyond what distributive principles alone might demand. This provides independent grounds for state intervention in housing markets rooted in relational rather than purely distributive concerns.

  POSITION: Relational egalitarian approach distinguishing civic status equality from distributive equality while showing status concerns constrain permissible distributions, with spatial implications.

DOMAIN: Occupancy Rights vs. Access Claims
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-02
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses a fundamental tension in political philosophy between
the rights of incumbent residents to remain in place (occupancy rights) and
the claims of outsiders to access territory or neighborhoods. The "occupancy
turn" emerged with Anna Stilz's work on territorial sovereignty (2019),
grounding territorial rights in individuals' occupancy rather than collective
self-determination alone. Huber and Wolkenstein (2018) extended this framework
to gentrification, arguing that residents have occupancy rights to remain in
neighborhoods where their "located life plans" are anchored.

The domain encompasses three interconnected debates: (1) philosophical
foundations of occupancy rights (Stilz, Moore, Mancilla), (2) gentrification
ethics and displacement justice (Lloyd, van Leeuwen, Dawkins, Draper, Jenkins),
and (3) the tension between protection of existing residents and claims of
newcomers. Recent work increasingly recognizes that gentrification threatens
not only through direct displacement but through neighborhood transformation
that disrupts the "background conditions" enabling residents' life plans.

Key recent developments (2020-2025) include: more sophisticated accounts of
what makes displacement wrongful beyond property loss (Lloyd 2023, van Leeuwen
2024); attention to domination and structural injustice in gentrification
(Jenkins 2022, Hoover 2023); and recognition that occupancy rights create
democratic claims over neighborhood governance (Wells 2021, Draper 2022).
A critical gap remains: few theorists directly address the contractualist
stand-off between incumbents and excluded outsiders.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project's examination of the
contractualist dilemma in housing justice. The occupancy rights literature
establishes that incumbents have weighty claims to stability and protection
from displacement, grounded in their located life plans. However, the literature
largely fails to address how these occupancy-based claims can be justified to
excluded outsiders who also need access to place to pursue their life plans.
This gap represents precisely the contractualist impasse the research project
aims to illuminate: principles protecting occupancy cannot be justified to the
excluded, yet principles prioritizing access cannot be justified to vulnerable
incumbents facing displacement.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection, with minimal
attention to access claims of excluded populations. Few papers explicitly
address the trade-off between occupancy and access, or examine how principles
might balance these competing claims. The contractualist framing of this
tension is entirely absent. Additionally, most work focuses on gentrification
in affluent nations, with limited attention to displacement in the Global South
or to climate-induced displacement that raises similar occupancy vs. access
tensions.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should map two primary positions: (1) occupancy-priority views
that emphasize protection of incumbent residents (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein,
Moore), and (2) emerging critiques that identify limitations of pure occupancy
approaches (Mancilla on dynamic occupancy, Lloyd on community goods). The
synthesis should emphasize that while the occupancy literature provides rich
resources for understanding incumbent claims, it systematically neglects the
perspective of excluded outsiders—precisely the blindspot a contractualist
analysis would reveal.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Occupancy Rights Theory: 8 papers - Incumbents have moral rights to remain in
  place where life plans are located (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein, Moore, Lloyd)
- Gentrification as Rights Violation: 7 papers - Displacement and transformation
  violate occupancy rights (van Leeuwen, Dawkins, Wells, Draper, Jenkins)
- Access vs. Occupancy Tension: 3 papers - Recognition of competing claims
  (Mancilla, Kim & Walton, Bonotti & Barnhill)

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198833536.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stilz develops a Kantian account of territorial rights grounded in three values: occupancy rights, basic justice, and collective self-determination. She argues that territorial sovereignty is justified not primarily through collective self-determination but through individuals' pre-political occupancy rights—their interest in remaining in places where their "located life plans" are anchored. This represents a fundamental reconceptualization: territorial rights protect individual autonomy through place-stability rather than collective control.

  RELEVANCE: Stilz's occupancy framework is foundational for this research domain and the broader project. Her account provides philosophical grounding for incumbent residents' claims to remain in place, establishing that displacement threatens core autonomy interests. However, her focus on occupancy as the primary ground for territorial rights raises the project's central question: how can occupancy-based principles be justified to excluded outsiders who also need access to territory to pursue their life plans? Stilz does not address this tension directly.

  POSITION: Represents the foundational "occupancy turn" in political philosophy, prioritizing individuals' located autonomy interests over purely collective grounds for territorial rights.

  pages = {378--397},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X18766818},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends Stilz's occupancy rights framework to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have moral rights to remain in neighborhoods where their "social, cultural, and economic practices are anchored." Displacement wrongs residents by disrupting the "background conditions" that enable their located life plans. Crucially, these rights extend beyond direct displacement to include protection against neighborhood transformation that undermines the spatial arrangements on which residents' plans depend. They propose participatory budgeting and democratic governance mechanisms to operationalize occupancy rights.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is central to the research project as it applies occupancy theory directly to housing and gentrification, the project's empirical focus. It establishes that incumbents have strong claims not merely to housing stability but to neighborhood character preservation. However, the paper exemplifies the project's concern: Huber and Wolkenstein focus entirely on protecting incumbents without addressing how such protection can be justified to excluded populations who need access to neighborhoods to pursue their own life plans. The paper notes but does not resolve that occupancy rights may conflict with newcomers' mobility rights.

  POSITION: Paradigmatic occupancy-priority position, arguing for robust incumbent protection including governance rights over neighborhood change.

  doi = {10.1080/07352166.2023.2216889},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lloyd advances beyond displacement-focused critiques by arguing that non-displacement gentrification also harms residents through damage to "thriving local communities." He synthesizes multiple theoretical approaches: occupancy rights (following Huber & Wolkenstein), relational equality concerns, and Lockean arguments that communities have labored together to create value. Lloyd argues that community goods constitute a separate sphere of justice à la Walzer, and that gentrification threatens these goods even without direct displacement through disruption of social networks, local institutions, and shared practices.

  RELEVANCE: Lloyd's focus on community goods rather than individual displacement connects directly to the project's concern with how social relationships constitute claims. His recognition that gentrification harms extend beyond displacement suggests occupancy rights may need to be understood more broadly than individual stability. However, Lloyd shares the field's blindspot: he does not address how community-preserving policies can be justified to excluded outsiders who need access to opportunities concentrated in these communities.

  POSITION: Occupancy rights theorist who broadens the framework to encompass collective goods and community integrity, moving beyond individualistic displacement focus.

  doi = {10.1177/03091325241289546},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Van Leeuwen provides a systematic survey of philosophical arguments about gentrification-related displacement, identifying five main approaches: autonomy-based (located life plans), community-based (social bonds), equality-based (relational equality), domination-based (structural power), and rights-based (occupancy rights proper). He argues that Huber and Wolkenstein's occupancy framework has been most influential but notes internal tensions—particularly regarding what counts as wrongful transformation versus acceptable neighborhood change. Van Leeuwen emphasizes that the literature converges on protecting "place-based" or "located life-plans" as the core concern.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive review clarifies the conceptual architecture of the gentrification ethics literature, revealing both its strengths and systematic gaps. Van Leeuwen identifies the field's consensus around protecting incumbent residents' autonomy through place-stability, which connects to the project's focus on occupancy claims. His observation that the literature focuses overwhelmingly on incumbent protection with minimal attention to newcomer claims directly supports the project's diagnosis of a contractualist blind spot.

  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2023.2181863},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dawkins examines gentrification through the lens of autonomy and located life plans, arguing that displacement wrongs residents by depriving them of "secure access to places of residence" necessary for pursuing any conception of the good. He distinguishes between direct displacement (forced exit) and indirect displacement (priced out), arguing both violate occupancy rights. Dawkins emphasizes that for disadvantaged populations, local communities function as crucial support networks, making displacement particularly harmful. He argues for regulatory interventions including rent control and community land trusts to protect occupancy.

  RELEVANCE: Dawkins connects occupancy theory directly to housing policy, demonstrating practical implications of philosophical principles. His emphasis on disadvantaged populations' particular vulnerability to displacement relates to the project's attention to structural injustice. However, Dawkins exemplifies the pattern: robust arguments for incumbent protection without addressing how these protections can be justified to excluded populations competing for scarce housing.

  pages = {1--21},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851221137510},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Draper argues that gentrification threatens "everyday democracy"—the informal democratic practices through which residents exercise collective agency over shared spaces. Drawing on occupancy rights theory, Draper contends that gentrification undermines residents' capacity to shape their neighborhoods through practices like community organizing, local decision-making, and collective action. She argues occupancy rights should include democratic participation rights, not merely rights against displacement. This reframes gentrification as a democratic deficit, not only an individual autonomy violation.

  RELEVANCE: Draper's focus on democratic dimensions of occupancy connects to contractualist concerns about justification: if occupancy rights include governance claims, this intensifies questions about how such exclusionary control can be justified to outsiders. Her work suggests occupancy theory may have more expansive implications than typically recognized, potentially deepening rather than resolving the tension between incumbent and newcomer claims.

  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2022.2119523},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jenkins argues that gentrification constitutes domination in the republican sense—arbitrary interference in residents' lives that undermines their freedom as non-domination. He critiques occupancy rights approaches (particularly Huber & Wolkenstein) for focusing too narrowly on located life plans, which excludes residents whose connection to place is less plan-structured. Jenkins argues gentrification dominates residents by subjecting them to arbitrary power of landlords, developers, and newcomers who can unilaterally transform neighborhoods. He emphasizes structural dimensions often missed by individualistic autonomy approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Jenkins provides important critical perspective on occupancy theory, noting its potential to exclude some vulnerable residents. His domination framework connects to republican and structural justice concerns that might inform contractualist analysis. However, Jenkins shares the field's limitation: his focus on protecting residents from domination does not address whether such protection could dominate excluded outsiders by denying them access to opportunity.

  volume = {70},
  pages = {1--20},
  doi = {10.1177/0032321721989168},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wells argues that state-led gentrification uniquely threatens residents' self-respect—their sense of themselves as worthy of equal moral status. When the state actively promotes gentrification, it sends a message that incumbent residents are less valuable than incoming wealthier populations. Wells builds on occupancy rights theory but emphasizes expressive harms: gentrification doesn't only threaten material interests but publicly devalues residents. She argues for enhanced democratic rights over neighborhoods as remedy, allowing residents to exercise collective control over neighborhood transformation.

  RELEVANCE: Wells connects occupancy concerns to recognition and standing, relevant to contractualist questions about justification and respect. Her focus on state-led gentrification raises questions about legitimate state action that connects to contractualist requirements. However, she does not address whether enhanced democratic control for incumbents could itself constitute disrespect toward excluded outsiders denied voice in decisions affecting their access to opportunity.

  pages = {1--27},
  doi = {10.1177/00905917231178295},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hoover synthesizes multiple approaches to gentrification injustice, examining how gentrification violates occupancy rights (through displacement), undermines community bonds, and instantiates structural injustice. He argues that gentrification is distinctively wrongful because it compounds existing injustices faced by marginalized communities, adding spatial displacement to historical patterns of exclusion and exploitation. Hoover emphasizes that gentrification cannot be understood apart from histories of racial segregation, disinvestment, and unequal development that create vulnerability to displacement.

  RELEVANCE: Hoover's attention to structural injustice and historical context connects to the project's concern with cumulative disadvantage and patterns of exclusion. His framework suggests that occupancy claims may be strengthened by historical injustice—but this raises contractualist questions about whether past wrongs justify present exclusion of outsiders who bear no responsibility for historical injustice.

  pages = {757--764},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2020.1797388},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Moore critiques Stilz's individualistic conception of occupancy rights for failing to distinguish between individual "Life-Planners" (people whose plans happen to be located somewhere) and Indigenous peoples whose connections to place are historical, collective, and constitutive of identity. Moore argues Stilz's framework inadequately explains the scope and weight of occupancy rights in cases like Navajo displacement, which involve collective territorial connections beyond individual life plans. She argues for group-based conceptions of occupancy to supplement individual residency rights.

  RELEVANCE: Moore's critique reveals important limitations of individualistic occupancy theory for understanding some displacement claims, particularly those involving Indigenous peoples or communities with deep historical connections to place. This connects to the project's concern with how different grounds for claims create different justificatory requirements. However, Moore focuses on strengthening incumbent claims rather than addressing tensions with access claims.

  pages = {765--772},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2020.1797389},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mancilla challenges Stilz's emphasis on "located" life plans by arguing that occupancy rights should protect "dynamic" as well as located occupancy—the freedom to move and pursue non-territorial life plans. She argues that Stilz's framework privileges settled, place-attached populations over mobile peoples (pastoralists, nomads, migrants) whose autonomy depends on mobility rather than fixity. Mancilla contends that protecting only located occupancy allows states to exclude mobile populations, undermining the autonomy rationale occupancy theory claims to serve.

  RELEVANCE: Mancilla's argument directly addresses a tension central to the research project: occupancy theory's focus on incumbent protection may systematically disadvantage mobile populations and newcomers. Her call for "dynamic occupancy" rights represents rare attention to access claims within occupancy literature. However, she does not fully develop how to balance located and dynamic occupancy when they conflict, which is precisely the contractualist challenge the project addresses.

  doi = {10.1007/s41055-022-00101-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bonotti and Barnhill extend occupancy rights analysis to food environments, arguing that gentrification threatens residents' located life plans through changes in food access, including loss of culturally appropriate foods, affordable options, and familiar food establishments. They argue that newcomers also develop occupancy interests once settled, complicating simple incumbent-newcomer distinctions. They propose anti-gentrification measures scaled to the compounding of disadvantage: stronger protections for already-disadvantaged groups, more modest protections for advantaged incumbents.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly engages the incumbent-newcomer tension, recognizing that newcomers develop occupancy interests that conflict with incumbent claims. Their attention to scaling protections by advantage level suggests possible principles for balancing claims. However, they do not fully address the contractualist question: how can differential treatment based on group membership be justified to those disadvantaged by it?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kim and Walton examine residential integration policies, arguing that advantaged groups relocating to disadvantaged neighborhoods can be permissible if properly regulated to prevent displacement. They acknowledge occupancy rights concerns but argue these can be addressed through regulation rather than restricting mobility. They contend that integration can benefit disadvantaged residents through improved services and opportunities, provided genuine anti-displacement protections exist. This represents rare attention to potential benefits of newcomer arrival for incumbents.

  RELEVANCE: Kim and Walton directly address the tension between incumbent occupancy claims and newcomer access claims, arguing for regulatory approaches that might balance both. Their framework attempts to satisfy both incumbents (through displacement protection) and newcomers (through access permissions).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fainstein develops a theory of urban justice based on three principles: democracy, diversity, and equity. She critiques purely procedural (Habermasian) approaches for failing to ensure just outcomes, and recognition-based approaches for neglecting material inequality. Drawing on Lefebvre's "right to the city," she argues that justice requires all groups have access to urban opportunities and participation in urban governance. She emphasizes tensions among the three principles, particularly between equity (redistribution) and diversity (recognition of difference).

  RELEVANCE: Fainstein's framework provides rare attention to access claims in urban theory, arguing that justice requires inclusion of currently excluded groups. Her "right to the city" draws attention to claims of outsiders seeking access, not only incumbent residents.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Van Leeuwen develops a theory of urban justice centered on access to "human space"—environments shaped by and for human activity, interaction, and meaning-making. He argues that justice requires ensuring all persons have access to diverse, vibrant human spaces that enable human flourishing. Van Leeuwen critiques both libertarian approaches (which ignore systemic exclusion) and some occupancy approaches (which may entrench existing patterns of segregation). He argues for principles that balance stability for incumbents with access for outsiders.

  RELEVANCE: Van Leeuwen provides important counterpoint to pure occupancy approaches by emphasizing access claims. His focus on what urban spaces provide (opportunities for human interaction and meaning) suggests grounds for access claims that don't depend on already being present. However, he does not fully develop how to resolve conflicts between incumbent stability and outsider access, which is the project's central concern.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Jurkevics examines large-scale land acquisitions ("land grabs") that dispossess and displace inhabitants, arguing that private land purchases can constitute de facto alienation of territorial sovereignty. She critiques traditional sovereignty frameworks for enabling such dispossession, and questions whether occupancy-based theories adequately protect against it. Jurkevics argues that democracy requires "world-building" practices—participation in decisions about land use and governance—that territorial sovereignty often undermines. She proposes "fracturing" sovereignty to enable more democratic land governance.

  RELEVANCE: Jurkevics's attention to how property markets enable displacement connects to gentrification concerns while situating them in broader questions of territorial governance. Her critique that sovereignty can undermine rather than protect occupancy suggests potential tensions within occupancy theory itself. Her emphasis on "world-building" practices relates to Draper's democratic concerns and raises questions about whose world-building claims have priority.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Monaghan critiques territorial thinking that assumes exclusive control over bounded spaces ("turf"), arguing that such frameworks often "overshoot"—claiming more control than can be justified. Drawing on recent literature including Huber & Wolkenstein, he argues that territorial claims should be more modest, acknowledging overlapping claims and shared stakes. Monaghan suggests that occupancy claims don't necessarily entail exclusionary control, and that more inclusive governance arrangements may better serve the values occupancy theory aims to protect.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Christmas argues that urban housing restrictions, including those justified by occupancy rights concerns, can violate liberty rights of property owners and prospective residents. He contends that occupancy-based arguments for restricting development or limiting newcomer access must clear high justificatory hurdles given their impact on freedom. Christmas argues that many anti-gentrification policies cannot satisfy these requirements and constitute unjustified paternalism. He advocates for liberalizing housing supply to address affordability without restricting liberty.

  RELEVANCE: Christmas represents a libertarian challenge to occupancy-based arguments, emphasizing costs of incumbent protection for liberty and access. His focus on justifiability to those burdened by restrictions connects to contractualist concerns, though from a different direction than the project emphasizes. His work illustrates that occupancy theory faces challenges from multiple perspectives, not only from excluded outsiders but from liberty theorists concerned with restriction of economic freedom.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Property-owning democracy (POD) emerged from John Rawls's late work as an
alternative to welfare-state capitalism, proposing wider dispersal of
productive capital ownership to realize fair equality of opportunity and
prevent domination. The O'Neill & Williamson 2012 edited volume catalyzed
contemporary debate, establishing POD as a distinct regime type beyond
traditional welfare redistribution. Freeman (2013, 2018) clarifies POD's
relationship to the difference principle, while Thomas (2016) synthesizes
POD with republican liberty. Recent work explores POD's application to
housing markets: Erck (2024) develops housing limitarianism within POD
framework; Gregory (2016) critiques homeownership-based POD as anti-
egalitarian; Halliday & Meyer (2024) survey housing justice broadly. Key
tensions include: whether POD requires tenure neutrality or favors
homeownership; how to justify price movements to affected parties; and
whether POD addresses wealth accumulation via housing appreciation.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question of whether POD applied
to housing meets contractualist justifiability standards. The tension
between POD's commitment to dispersed ownership and the impossibility of
justifying both price appreciation (to newcomers) and price suppression
(to incumbent owners) provides the empirical test case for contractualist
limits on POD regimes.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work directly addresses contractualist justifiability of housing
price dynamics under POD. Most literature assumes POD is justified without
examining whether specific policies can meet reasonable acceptance tests.
Erck (2024) is the only recent work directly applying POD framework to
housing wealth ceilings, but does not address price dynamics or newcomer
claims.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish general POD theory (O'Neill & Williamson, Freeman, Thomas) from
housing applications (Erck, Gregory, Halliday & Meyer). Note critiques from
Vallier (2015) challenging POD's economic viability. The tension between
dispersed homeownership as POD's ideal and housing appreciation as source
of inequality is central to the project's contractualist critique.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- POD as distinct regime type: 10 papers - O'Neill, Williamson, Freeman, Thomas, Kerr
- POD applied to housing/wealth: 5 papers - Erck, Gregory, Halliday, James Gregory on homeownership
- Critiques of POD viability: 3 papers - Vallier, Narveson, Raekstad (ambivalent)

  title = {Property-Owning Democracy: Rawls and Beyond},
  year = {2012},
  publisher = {Wiley-Blackwell},
  address = {Malden, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational edited volume establishes property-owning
  democracy as a distinct regime type requiring dispersed capital ownership,
  not merely redistributive transfers. Contributors argue POD realizes Rawls's
  principles of justice better than welfare-state capitalism by preventing
  domination and securing fair equality of opportunity through predistribution
  rather than redistribution. The volume includes theoretical foundations
  (Chambers, Jackson, Brettschneider, O'Neill, Thomas, White), institutional
  applications (Hsieh, Robeyns, Hussain, Schweickart), and practical politics
  (Williamson, Sodha, Alperovitz).

  RELEVANCE: Essential framing for understanding POD as an alternative to
  welfare capitalism. Establishes the conceptual toolkit for applying POD to
  housing: if POD requires dispersed productive capital ownership to prevent
  domination and secure opportunity, does this favor homeownership (as asset)
  or tenure neutrality? The volume does not directly address housing markets
  or price dynamics, leaving open whether POD can justify housing wealth
  accumulation or must suppress it.

  POSITION: Represents the "POD as progressive alternative to capitalism"
  position, arguing POD can realize egalitarian and republican values through
  market-based but non-capitalist institutions. Sets the terms of debate that
  Erck (2024) and Gregory (2016) later apply to housing specifically.

  volume = {35},
  pages = {9--36},
  doi = {10.1515/auk-2013-0103},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Freeman clarifies Rawls's conception of property-owning
  democracy and its relationship to the difference principle. POD is the
  social system Rawls believed best realizes his principles of justice because
  welfare-state capitalism inevitably concentrates power and undermines fair
  equality of opportunity, self-respect, and democratic reciprocity. The
  difference principle requires choosing background institutions (the social
  system), not just redistributive policies. Freeman explains why Rawls saw
  welfare-state capitalism as connected to utilitarianism's acceptance of
  unequal power.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding why POD is not simply welfare
  capitalism plus asset transfers. If POD requires background institutions
  that prevent wealth concentration, this has implications for housing policy:
  can a regime allow housing to function as wealth accumulation vehicle while
  preventing domination? Freeman's emphasis on self-respect and reciprocity
  suggests housing arrangements must be mutually justifiable, directly relevant
  to the contractualist test.

  POSITION: Authoritative interpretation of Rawlsian POD, establishing POD as
  requiring institutional structure that prevents domination, not merely
  outcome-based redistribution.

  address = {New York},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190602116.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Thomas synthesizes neo-republican political theory with
  Rawlsian justice as fairness, arguing POD structures economic incentives to
  make domination structurally impossible in markets. He defends POD against
  market socialism, arguing POD better protects individual liberty while
  achieving distributive justice through predistributive institutions. The book
  develops a conception of liberal republicanism where dispersed capital
  ownership is necessary for non-domination and market freedom.

  RELEVANCE: Thomas provides the most comprehensive book-length defense of POD
  as a distinct regime type. His emphasis on structural impossibility of
  domination raises questions about housing: if housing is the primary asset
  for most households, does its price volatility create domination of
  newcomers by incumbents (via affordability) or vice versa (via suppression)?
  Thomas does not directly address housing markets, leaving this tension
  unresolved.

  POSITION: Leading contemporary defender of POD as synthesis of liberal and
  republican values, establishing predistribution as central to justice.

  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315276434},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kerr develops a market-democratic interpretation of POD
  that seeks common ground between classical and social liberalism. He argues
  predistributive POD institutions are essential both for protecting market
  freedom (classical liberal concern) and maximizing opportunities for the
  least advantaged (social liberal concern). The book identifies POD as a
  progressive alternative to welfare-state capitalism that both liberals can
  endorse, though classical and social liberals will disagree about many
  implementation details.

  RELEVANCE: Kerr's attempt to reconcile classical and social liberal support
  for POD is relevant to the contractualist test: if POD institutions must be
  justifiable to both liberty-prioritizing and equality-prioritizing
  perspectives, housing policies face an especially difficult test. Can housing
  price appreciation be justified to newcomers prioritizing opportunity? Can
  price suppression be justified to incumbents prioritizing liberty and asset
  protection?

  POSITION: Represents "POD as common ground" position, seeking institutions
  both classical and social liberals can endorse on different grounds.

  volume = {42},
  pages = {139--154},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2024.2391424},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Erck develops "housing limitarianism" - the doctrine that it
  is morally wrong to have too much housing while others lack enough, and
  governments should limit excessive housing acquisition by individuals and
  corporations. Drawing on Rawls's property-owning democracy ideal, she argues
  for dispersing homeownership throughout society via housing wealth ceilings.
  Erck addresses the tension between increasing affordable housing supply and
  preserving wildlife habitat, proposing ethical frameworks for negotiating
  this conflict within housing justice.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most directly relevant recent work, explicitly
  applying POD framework to housing and arguing for wealth ceilings on housing
  ownership. However, Erck does not address the core tension in the research
  project: whether POD can justify housing price dynamics to affected parties.
  Her limitarianism focuses on quantity of housing owned (excess homes), not
  value appreciation of primary residences. The research project asks whether
  even dispersed homeownership creates justifiability problems when housing
  appreciates or is suppressed.

  POSITION: Represents "housing limitarianism within POD" position, extending
  Robeyns's economic limitarianism specifically to housing wealth.

  journal = {Philosophy Compass},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {19},
  doi = {10.1111/phc3.12966},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive survey article maps philosophical work
  linking housing to economic justice over the past decade. The authors
  identify five major themes: the value of a home, homelessness, gentrification,
  segregation, and spatial justice. They argue for greater philosophical
  attention to macroeconomic factors (fiscal and monetary policy) affecting
  housing justice, and advocate for normative approaches beyond human
  flourishing and relational equality frameworks that can address distributive
  concerns directly.

  RELEVANCE: Essential orientation to the housing justice literature. Halliday
  and Meyer note the field has focused on access, homelessness, and spatial
  distribution, but has given less attention to price dynamics and wealth
  accumulation via homeownership. Their call for normative approaches addressing
  "justice issues not readily addressed by frameworks prioritizing human
  flourishing or relational equality" opens space for the contractualist
  approach to price justifiability that this research develops.

  POSITION: Comprehensive survey establishing state of housing justice field,
  identifying gaps in philosophical attention to macroeconomic factors and
  distributive justice frameworks.

  volume = {16},
  pages = {146--167},
  doi = {10.1080/14616718.2015.1115224},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gregory offers a critical evaluation of property-owning
  democracy (POD) as realized through homeownership expansion in UK and US
  contexts. He distinguishes two interpretations: the dominant conservative
  interpretation linking homeownership to virtuous citizenship and small-state
  ideology; and a subordinate egalitarian interpretation seeking solidarity
  and interdependence via broader property ownership. Gregory argues the
  egalitarian reinterpretation of POD is "politically and sociologically naïve"
  and offers "an untenable counter-narrative to welfare retrenchment" because
  homeownership-based POD has created anti-welfare dynamics.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how POD applied to housing can fail
  egalitarian aims. Gregory's argument that homeownership-based POD generates
  anti-egalitarian politics supports this project's thesis: if housing
  functions as primary wealth accumulation vehicle, price appreciation cannot
  be justified to newcomers, yet price suppression cannot be justified to
  incumbent owner-occupiers whose housing is their main asset. This structural
  tension makes housing-based POD problematic from contractualist perspective.

  POSITION: Represents "critique of homeownership-based POD" position, arguing
  POD realized via housing expansion creates inequality rather than dispersing
  it.

  volume = {37},
  pages = {103--124},
  doi = {10.3138/ttr.37.2.103},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: White explores four supportive connections between
  republicanism and POD: (1) POD supports republican legitimacy; (2) POD
  supports republican liberty (non-domination); (3) republican citizenship
  supports POD's stability; (4) republican politics affirming popular
  sovereignty is necessary for achieving POD reforms, especially in polities
  experiencing oligarchic power shifts. White argues liberalism and republicanism
  are "modular toolkits" that can be combined, challenging the opposition
  between Rawlsian liberalism and republicanism.

  RELEVANCE: White's connection between POD and non-domination is relevant
  to housing: if POD aims to prevent domination via dispersed property
  ownership, does making housing the primary asset create domination when
  prices fluctuate? His emphasis on popular sovereignty and political reform
  as preconditions for POD suggests that housing policies must be justifiable
  through democratic processes - but the contractualist critique suggests no
  housing price policy can meet reasonable acceptance by all affected parties.

  POSITION: Represents "republican POD" position, connecting property
  dispersal to non-domination and civic virtue.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190699260.003.0005},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book chapter version expands Freeman's 2013 article,
  providing fuller treatment of why Rawls thought welfare-state capitalism
  could not fulfill his principles of justice. Freeman emphasizes the "crucial
  role of democratic reciprocity and the social bases of self-respect" in
  Rawls's argument for both the difference principle and POD. POD is not
  merely about economic outcomes but about maintaining conditions for mutual
  respect and reciprocal relations among free and equal citizens.

  RELEVANCE: Freeman's emphasis on democratic reciprocity and self-respect
  strengthens the contractualist critique of housing-based POD. If POD requires
  arrangements all can view as reciprocal and supporting self-respect, housing
  policies that enrich some through appreciation while excluding others fail
  this test. Similarly, policies that suppress housing values attack the
  self-respect of those whose main asset is their home. The reciprocity
  framework aligns with contractualist reasonable acceptance.

  POSITION: Authoritative Rawlsian interpretation emphasizing self-respect
  and reciprocity as core to POD, not merely distributive patterns.

  title = {Rawls, Property-Owning Democracy, and Democratic Socialism},

  year = {2014},
  volume = {45},
  pages = {228--251},
  doi = {10.1111/josp.12061},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Malleson argues that democratic socialism better realizes
  Rawls's principles of justice than property-owning democracy. While POD aims
  to disperse capital ownership widely, it retains private ownership and market
  allocation of productive assets. Democratic socialism, through worker control
  and democratic planning, better prevents domination and secures fair equality
  of opportunity. Malleson contends that POD's reliance on market allocation
  of capital will inevitably recreate concentrations of wealth and power.

  RELEVANCE: Malleson's critique of POD as insufficient suggests even achieving
  dispersed ownership may not solve domination problems if markets generate
  concentration over time. Applied to housing: even if POD succeeds in
  dispersing homeownership, market dynamics of appreciation and speculation
  will recreate wealth concentration. This supports viewing housing-based POD
  as structurally unstable - either it allows appreciation (recreating
  inequality) or suppresses it (undermining asset-based security).

  POSITION: Represents "democratic socialist critique of POD" position,
  arguing POD cannot achieve its aims without transcending market allocation
  entirely.

  publisher = {Wiley-Blackwell},
  pages = {33--52},
  doi = {10.1002/9781444355192.ch2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jackson traces the intellectual history of "property-owning
  democracy" from its coining by Noel Skelton in 1923 through various
  reinterpretations by British Conservatives and others. He shows how the
  concept has been periodically revived and redefined, with Margaret Thatcher's
  1980s reinterpretation emphasizing homeownership expansion as central.
  Jackson's history reveals that POD has been a "essentially contested concept"
  with conservative, progressive, and radical variants throughout the 20th
  century.

  RELEVANCE: Jackson's history reveals that homeownership expansion has long
  been central to political deployments of POD, but this was often conservative
  rather than egalitarian in intent. The Thatcherite association of POD with
  homeownership and welfare retrenchment (as Gregory 2016 emphasizes) suggests
  that using housing as the vehicle for property dispersal has anti-egalitarian
  risks. This historical perspective supports questioning whether housing can
  serve POD's egalitarian aims.

  conservative appropriation via homeownership expansion.

  title = {The Difference Principle, Capitalism, and Property-Owning Democracy},

  year = {2017},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {151--172},
  doi = {10.1515/mopp-2017-0012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lister defends POD against the Brennan-Tomasi argument that
  welfare-state capitalism better satisfies the difference principle by
  maximizing long-run income growth for the worst-off. Lister argues the
  difference principle should not require the present worst-off to accept
  inequality that doesn't benefit them for the sake of future worst-off who
  will be better-off anyway. This interpretation supports POD over growth-
  maximizing capitalism even focusing on income alone, without appealing to
  political influence or workplace control.

  RELEVANCE: Lister's defense of POD based on fairness to the present worst-off
  has implications for housing policy. If we cannot require the present worst-off
  to sacrifice for future generations who will be better-off anyway, this
  applies to housing: we cannot require current non-owners to accept
  unaffordable housing (enabling incumbent owners' wealth accumulation) on
  grounds that future policies will help future worst-off. This time-indexed
  fairness requirement supports the contractualist critique.

  POSITION: Represents defense of POD against welfarist critique, emphasizing
  fairness to present worst-off over intertemporal income maximization.

  volume = {19},
  pages = {614--622},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885117725900},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This review article of Alan Thomas's Republic of Equals
  examines Thomas's critique of market socialism and his defense of POD as
  compatible with justice as fairness. Raekstad argues Thomas fails to show
  market socialism is incompatible with Rawlsian justice, leaving POD and
  market socialism as potentially equal alternatives. Raekstad questions POD's
  feasibility as an alternative to familiar forms of capitalism, expressing
  skepticism about whether POD can be achieved and sustained given path
  dependencies and political obstacles.

  RELEVANCE: Raekstad's feasibility concerns about POD implementation are
  relevant to housing applications. If POD requires sustained political will
  to prevent wealth reconcentration, using housing as the vehicle makes this
  especially difficult: homeowners become a constituency defending asset values,
  creating political obstacles to policies preventing wealth concentration via
  housing appreciation. This suggests housing-based POD may be particularly
  unstable.

  POSITION: Skeptical of POD's feasibility while defending market socialism
  as equally compatible with Rawlsian justice.

  pages = {330--354},
  doi = {10.1080/08913811.2015.1111642},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vallier offers a systematic critique of POD from both moral
  and economic perspectives, defending welfare-state capitalism as better
  satisfying Rawlsian principles. He argues POD is economically ineffective,
  generating bad incentives and facing severe information problems compared to
  market-friendly welfare states. Morally, Vallier contends POD requires
  unjustifiable restrictions on economic liberty and cannot deliver its
  promised benefits. He argues welfare-state capitalism with robust
  redistribution better achieves Rawlsian aims.

  RELEVANCE: Vallier's critique suggests POD faces implementation problems
  that make it inferior to welfare redistribution. Applied to housing: if POD
  requires preventing wealth concentration via ownership, this may require
  unjustifiable restrictions on property rights (Vallier's liberty concern)
  while failing to deliver promised benefits (his efficacy concern). However,
  Vallier does not address whether welfare-state redistribution can solve
  housing affordability without suppressing prices - the contractualist
  critique suggests neither POD nor welfare capitalism solves the housing
  justifiability problem.

  volume = {39},
  pages = {481--501},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2022.2056148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kimhur applies Amartya Sen's capability approach to housing
  justice, proposing that policy should focus on changes in unjust housing
  situations in terms of people's "capability for housing" rather than absolute
  distributional principles or welfare state regime characteristics. She
  proposes evaluating housing capability through three dimensions: housing
  opportunities, housing securities, and housing abilities. This approach
  emphasizes comparative assessment of capability expansion rather than ideal
  theory.

  RELEVANCE: Kimhur's capability approach offers an alternative to both POD
  and welfare-state frameworks for housing justice. Her emphasis on housing
  capabilities rather than housing ownership sidesteps the POD question of
  whether dispersed homeownership is necessary. However, the capability
  approach does not resolve the contractualist justifiability problem: even
  if we focus on capabilities, policies that expand housing capabilities for
  some (via price suppression helping newcomers) may contract capabilities for
  others (incumbent owners losing asset security).

  volume = {39},
  pages = {393--404},
  doi = {10.1515/auk-2017-0021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Narveson argues that Rawlsian requirements for justice are
  better met by "just plain capitalism" (free markets with minimal welfare
  safety net) than by either POD or democratic socialism. He contends that POD
  and socialism impose unjustifiable restrictions on liberty and property
  rights, and that capitalism's wealth-creating capacity better serves the
  worst-off than egalitarian redistribution or ownership restrictions. Narveson
  defends libertarian property rights against Rawlsian egalitarianism.

  RELEVANCE: Narveson's libertarian critique suggests any restrictions on
  property rights or market outcomes (including POD's dispersal requirements)
  violate liberty. Applied to housing: Narveson would reject both price
  suppression (violating incumbent owners' rights) and policies preventing
  appreciation as asset accumulation. However, his position does not address
  whether unrestricted markets can justify outcomes to those who lack access -
  the contractualist critique operates from different premises than
  libertarianism.

  volume = {35},
  pages = {193--212},
  doi = {10.1515/auk-2013-0115},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schefczyk compares POD and welfare-state capitalism as
  realistically utopian alternatives for maintaining background justice over
  time. He argues that while POD aims to prevent wealth concentration through
  predistribution, welfare states can maintain justice through ongoing
  redistribution if properly designed. Schefczyk examines whether either regime
  can actually maintain fair background conditions intergenerationally,
  considering institutional stability and political feasibility challenges both
  face.

  RELEVANCE: Schefczyk's focus on maintaining background justice over time is
  relevant to housing: if housing functions as primary wealth accumulation
  vehicle, neither POD nor welfare state can easily maintain fair background
  conditions. POD faces the problem that dispersed homeownership enables
  wealth reconcentration via appreciation; welfare states face the problem
  that redistributing housing wealth undermines political support. The
  intergenerational perspective highlights how housing-based wealth
  accumulation creates path-dependent inequality.

  volume = {35},
  pages = {37--54},
  doi = {10.1515/auk-2013-0104},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Weale examines the contrast Rawls draws between POD and
  welfare-state capitalism, arguing that the distinction is less sharp than
  POD advocates suggest. He contends that well-designed welfare states can
  achieve many of POD's aims (dispersing power, securing opportunity,
  maintaining self-respect) through redistributive taxation and social
  provision without requiring predistributive ownership dispersal. Weale
  questions whether the costs and risks of implementing POD are justified given
  that reformed welfare states might achieve similar justice outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: Weale's argument that welfare states can achieve POD's aims
  through redistribution suggests housing justice might not require dispersed
  homeownership. However, this sidesteps the contractualist problem:
  redistribution from homeowners to renters via taxation faces justification
  problems (why should owners subsidize non-owners?), while preventing
  appreciation also faces justification problems (why should owners sacrifice
  asset values?). Neither POD nor welfare-state frameworks resolve the core
  justifiability tension.

  POSITION: Skeptical of POD's necessity, arguing welfare states can achieve
  similar aims through redistribution with fewer implementation risks.

Intergenerational justice concerns obligations present generations owe to future generations, especially under conditions of uncertainty and irreversibility. The field addresses fundamental questions: Can we have duties to non-existent people? What do we owe those whose preferences remain unknown? How should we balance present needs against future welfare when our decisions have permanent consequences?

Three major debates structure this domain. First, the non-identity problem (Parfit) questions whether we can harm future people when our choices determine who exists. Second, theories of obligation divide between reciprocity-based accounts (Gosseries), sufficientarian approaches (Timmer), and relational egalitarian frameworks (Bengtson, Lippert-Rasmussen). Third, the role of uncertainty creates tensions between optimization, satisficing, and option-preservation strategies.

Epistemic justice literature (Fricker 2007, Medina 2013) traditionally addresses testimonial and hermeneutical injustices against marginalized groups. Recent work extends these concepts to planning and policy contexts (Anderson 2012, Byskov & Hyams 2023), revealing how decision-making frameworks can systematically exclude certain forms of knowledge or impose epistemic harms on future generations. The connection between epistemic constraints and intergenerational obligations remains underexplored, creating an opening for arguments that epistemic humility about future preferences demands preserving options rather than optimizing based on present assumptions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the core tension in the research project: urban planning decisions bind future generations whose preferences are unknown, creating both epistemic constraints (we cannot know what they will value) and irreversibility (urban form persists across generations). The literature provides frameworks for thinking about obligations under uncertainty, the moral significance of option preservation, and how epistemic duties to future knowers might constrain present decision-making authority.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While intergenerational justice literature addresses uncertainty about future welfare, it rarely engages systematically with epistemic justice frameworks. Conversely, epistemic justice literature focuses primarily on contemporaneous relationships, not duties to future knowers. The intersection—epistemic duties to future generations as a constraint on present planning authority—remains largely untheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Look for connections between: (1) Gosseries and Fricker on how reciprocity/credibility structures might extend intergenerationally; (2) Zwarthoed and Medina on how option preservation relates to epistemic capacity-building; (3) Doorn 2025 and Anderson 2012 on institutional design for epistemic justice under uncertainty. The sufficientarian literature (Timmer, Benbaji) may provide resources for thinking about threshold duties distinct from optimization.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Contractualism (Rawls, Gosseries): 5 papers - Obligations grounded in hypothetical agreement or reciprocity across generations
- Sufficientarianism (Timmer, Benbaji): 3 papers - Threshold-based duties distinct from maximization or equality
- Epistemic Justice (Fricker, Medina, Anderson): 5 papers - Duties to recognize diverse knowers and avoid testimonial/hermeneutical harms
- Option Preservation (Zwarthoed, Doorn): 2 papers - Obligations to maintain choice-sets rather than optimize
- Relational Egalitarianism (Bengtson, Lippert-Rasmussen, Chan): 3 papers - Justice as equal social relations extended intergenerationally

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker introduces the concept of epistemic injustice—wronging someone specifically in their capacity as a knower. She distinguishes testimonial injustice (deflating someone's credibility due to prejudice) from hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to interpret one's experiences due to marginalization). Both forms constitute distinctive wrongs because they damage people's epistemic agency, not merely their material interests. She argues epistemic justice requires cultivating intellectual virtues like testimonial sensitivity.

  RELEVANCE: While Fricker focuses on contemporaneous relationships, her framework is essential for theorizing epistemic duties to future generations. If present planning decisions constrain future people's epistemic capacities—by foreclosing interpretive frameworks or imposing hermeneutical gaps—this constitutes an epistemic harm distinct from material harm. The project extends Fricker's framework to intergenerational contexts: we owe future generations not just resources but epistemic standing, which requires preserving interpretive options rather than optimizing based on present conceptual schemes.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Medina extends Fricker's framework by emphasizing credibility excess (not just deficit) and developing the concept of meta-lucidity—critical awareness of one's epistemic limitations. He argues epistemic injustice is structural, not merely interpersonal, requiring collective resistance through what he calls "epistemic activism." Dominant groups suffer from epistemic arrogance and hermeneutical ignorance, actively resisting knowledge that threatens their privilege. Epistemic justice demands cultivating epistemic friction—discomfort that prompts questioning one's assumptions.

  RELEVANCE: Medina's structural analysis illuminates how planning institutions might systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others, including those of future generations. His concept of meta-lucidity—awareness that our interpretive resources are limited and potentially distorting—directly supports arguments for epistemic humility in long-term planning. If we recognize we cannot know future preferences and our conceptual schemes may be parochial, this epistemic friction should constrain optimization-based approaches that assume present frameworks adequately capture all relevant values.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational edited volume systematically addresses whether justice applies across non-overlapping generations. Gosseries' contribution analyzes three models of intergenerational reciprocity: descending (parents to children), ascending (children to parents), and double reciprocity. He argues that while direct reciprocity fails between non-overlapping generations, indirect reciprocity through chains of obligation can ground duties to the distant future. The volume addresses the non-identity problem, theories of sustainability, and competing accounts of what we owe posterity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how obligation-structures might extend intergenerationally despite lack of reciprocal capacity. The project's argument about epistemic duties to future generations requires showing these duties persist even when future people cannot reciprocate. Gosseries' work on indirect reciprocity and chain-of-obligation models provides resources for this move. Additionally, his treatment of uncertainty and competing sustainability principles (sufficientarian vs. egalitarian) directly engages questions about option preservation vs. optimization under epistemic constraints.

  pages = {163--173},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2011.652211},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson shifts epistemic justice from individual virtue ethics (Fricker) to institutional design. She argues social institutions—not just individuals—can exhibit epistemic justice or injustice through their testimonial gathering and assessment systems. Institutions that systematically exclude certain voices or fail to design mechanisms correcting for bias instantiate epistemic injustice. She emphasizes that institutional solutions may succeed where individual virtue-cultivation fails, because cognitive biases are often difficult for even well-intentioned individuals to overcome.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for the project's institutional focus on urban planning. If epistemic justice requires institutional design that counteracts bias and includes diverse perspectives, then planning institutions making irreversible decisions about future urban form face distinctive epistemic duties. Anderson's framework supports arguments that planning processes must incorporate mechanisms for recognizing epistemic uncertainty about future values—not merely better individual epistemic virtues in planners, but institutional structures that preserve options precisely because we institutionally recognize our epistemic limitations regarding future generations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker argues epistemic justice is constitutive of political freedom in the republican tradition of non-domination (Pettit). If citizens suffer testimonial or hermeneutical injustice, they cannot effectively contest political decisions—lacking either credibility or interpretive resources to articulate grievances. Thus epistemic injustice enables domination: the capacity of others to interfere arbitrarily in one's affairs. Epistemic justice becomes not merely a virtue but a precondition for legitimate political authority.

  RELEVANCE: Extends epistemic justice to political legitimacy, directly relevant to planning authority. If legitimate political power requires that those subject to it can meaningfully contest decisions, and epistemic injustice disables contestation, then planning decisions that bind future generations while denying them epistemic standing may lack legitimacy. The project can argue: binding future generations to irreversible urban forms without preserving their epistemic capacity to interpret and contest those forms constitutes a form of domination—arbitrary interference they cannot resist because they lack both presence and (if we impose rather than preserve frameworks) adequate hermeneutical resources.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zwarthoed argues that leaving future generations a world of artificial substitutes for nature (plastic trees, electronic birds) wrongs them even if these substitutes satisfy their preferences—because such a world fails to secure adequate options for autonomous choice. Drawing on autonomy-based theories, she contends we have duties to preserve genuine natural environments not because future people will necessarily prefer them, but because adequate option sets require availability of diverse authentic experiences. Option preservation is distinct from preference satisfaction: we owe future generations real choices, not optimized outcomes based on predicted preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the option preservation framework central to the project. Zwarthoed provides philosophical resources for distinguishing preservation duties from optimization: even if we could predict future preferences accurately (we cannot), we would still owe them adequate options rather than merely satisfying predicted preferences. Applied to urban planning: irreversible decisions that foreclose future options (e.g., permanently precluding certain urban forms) wrong future generations by constraining their autonomous choice, regardless of whether the imposed form satisfies their predicted preferences. The argument reinforces epistemic humility: uncertainty about future values strengthens rather than weakens the case for option preservation.

  pages = {368--386},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820824000049},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmer defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for intergenerational justice. He distinguishes a deprivation threshold (minimum needs) from an affluence threshold (comfortable life), arguing that freedom from deprivation in one generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another, but does not lexically outweigh freedom from deprivation in other generations. This avoids both extreme prioritarianism (which could demand impoverishing present generation for marginal future benefits) and weak sufficientarianism (which permits affluence for present at cost of future deprivation). Sufficientarian principles are distinctively appropriate for intergenerational contexts because they respect both urgency of basic needs and independence of different generations' claims.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a threshold-based alternative to optimization that respects irreducibility of different generations' claims. For the project: if intergenerational obligations are sufficientarian (securing thresholds) rather than maximizing (optimizing welfare), this supports preserving options sufficient for future flourishing rather than optimizing based on predicted preferences. The lexical priority of avoiding deprivation over increasing affluence suggests planning should prioritize preserving essential options (housing, mobility, public space) rather than optimizing for predicted preferences that might sacrifice these essentials. This approach handles uncertainty better than optimization because thresholds are more robust to preference-variation than optimal points.

  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2025.2462360},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bengtson argues relational egalitarianism faces a fundamental dilemma regarding intergenerational justice. Relational egalitarianism holds justice requires equal social relations, but non-overlapping generations lack social relations in the relevant sense. Attempts to extend relational egalitarianism intergenerationally by weakening the notion of "social relations" either fail to ground distinctively relational (vs. distributive) requirements, or fail to ground egalitarian (vs. sufficientarian) requirements. He concludes relational egalitarianism cannot justify obligations to future generations without abandoning core commitments.

  RELEVANCE: While challenging relational egalitarianism, Bengtson's analysis illuminates constraints on intergenerational obligation-theories. For the project: if relational accounts struggle with future generations due to absence of reciprocal social relations, this strengthens the case for epistemic-duty approaches that do not require reciprocity. Epistemic duties to avoid wronging future knowers can persist without social relations: we owe them adequate epistemic resources (hermeneutical frameworks, option-sets supporting autonomous interpretation) not because we relate to them socially, but because our decisions determine their epistemic capacities. This suggests epistemic approaches may handle intergenerational contexts better than relational ones.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lippert-Rasmussen examines whether relational egalitarians can accommodate intergenerational justice by redefining "social relations" to include non-overlapping generations. He evaluates multiple proposals (indirect relations through chains, causal relations, community membership, institutional relations) and argues each faces a dilemma: either the relations become too thin to ground distinctively relational (vs. distributive) obligations, or they fail to ground egalitarian (vs. merely sufficientarian) requirements. The temporal non-overlap problem reveals fundamental tensions in relational egalitarianism's conceptual structure.

  RELEVANCE: Deepens understanding of why relational frameworks struggle intergenerationally. For the project: the failure of relation-based theories strengthens alternative approaches grounded in capacity-respect rather than relationship. Epistemic duties not to wrong future knowers need not depend on social relations—we violate these duties by constraining their epistemic capacities through our choices (hermeneutical injustice), regardless of whether we stand in social relations. The argument can proceed: while relational egalitarianism founders on temporal non-overlap, epistemic justice theories can extend intergenerationally because epistemic harms transcend the requirement for contemporaneous social relations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chan defends relational egalitarianism against intergenerational objections by arguing we owe future generations not merely resources but the capacity to relate to each other as equals. This requires transforming oppressive social categories (race, gender, class) that structure unequal relations. Failing to transform these categories constitutes a double wrong: unjust relations with contemporaries and wronging future people who inherit oppressive category-structures. The duty extends across non-overlapping generations because social categories persist intergenerationally, even when particular relations do not.

  RELEVANCE: Chan's argument about transforming social categories to preserve future relational capacity parallels the project's argument about preserving future epistemic capacity. Just as oppressive categories constrain future people's capacity for equal relations, constraining interpretive frameworks and option-sets constrains future people's epistemic capacities. The parallel strengthens the case that we have duties to preserve conditions for future capacities (whether relational or epistemic) even absent direct relations with future people. Applied to planning: irreversible decisions that foreclose frameworks future people might use to interpret and contest urban form wrong them by constraining their epistemic capacity, similar to how perpetuating oppressive categories wrongs them relationally.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Doorn applies intergenerational justice principles to risk management, arguing that irreversibility and option-foreclosure constitute distinctive wrongs to future generations. She defends an option-preservation framework: under uncertainty about future values and facing potentially irreversible planetary losses, present generations have duties to preserve option-sets rather than optimize based on current risk assessments. The argument combines uncertainty about future preferences with irreversibility of certain losses to ground strong duties against foreclosing options, even when optimization-approaches might recommend accepting irreversible risks.

  RELEVANCE: Directly parallels the project's argument structure applied to environmental rather than urban contexts. Doorn's framework for environmental option-preservation under uncertainty transfers to urban planning: irreversible decisions about urban form under epistemic uncertainty about future preferences trigger duties to preserve options rather than optimize. Her treatment of irreversibility is especially relevant—certain urban decisions (e.g., highway locations, density patterns, infrastructure commitments) are practically irreversible across generations. Combined with epistemic uncertainty about future values, this grounds strong duties to preserve diverse urban options rather than locking in single optimized forms based on present assumptions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Byskov and Hyams apply epistemic injustice concepts to climate adaptation policy, arguing that adaptation planning systematically marginalizes Indigenous knowledges through testimonial injustice (discrediting Indigenous testimony) and hermeneutical injustice (lacking conceptual resources to recognize Indigenous knowledge systems). They identify five conditions demonstrating epistemic injustice in adaptation planning: systematic underrepresentation of Indigenous knowledge, credibility deficits due to prejudice, exclusion from knowledge-generating processes, hermeneutical marginalization, and political powerlessness. Epistemic justice in adaptation requires not merely including Indigenous voices but transforming the epistemic frameworks structuring policy discourse.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how epistemic injustice operates in long-term planning contexts under uncertainty—precisely the domain of the research project. While Byskov and Hyams focus on Indigenous knowledge, their framework illuminates how planning institutions systematically privilege certain epistemic frameworks while marginalizing others. Extended to intergenerational context: planning processes that optimize based on present frameworks while foreclosing future interpretive possibilities commit hermeneutical injustice against future generations—they inherit a world structured by our conceptual schemes without adequate resources to interpret or contest it. The argument strengthens the case for epistemic humility in irreversible planning decisions.

  doi = {10.1007/s11158-024-09667-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Inoue challenges Sommers' defense of relational egalitarianism's intergenerational extension, arguing that relational egalitarianism faces comparative disadvantages in justifying present duties to future generations. Unlike distributive theories (utilitarianism, prioritarianism, luck egalitarianism), relational egalitarianism cannot appeal to time-invariant principles because its principles are context-sensitive—they depend on existing practices and relationships. This context-sensitivity makes it harder to ground duties to future generations absent actual relations. The "chain-relatedness" problem shows relational egalitarianism struggles to justify why present persons have duties to remote future others.

  RELEVANCE: While critical of relational approaches, Inoue's analysis clarifies advantages of non-relational theories for intergenerational contexts. For the project: epistemic duty-approaches can avoid Inoue's objection because epistemic harms (testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice) do not require social relations to constitute wrongs. We can wrong future people epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities through our choices, regardless of whether we stand in social relations with them. This suggests epistemic approaches may be better suited than relational ones for grounding intergenerational obligations, especially regarding irreversible decisions under uncertainty.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Halsband examines AI decision-support systems used for long-term policy planning from an intergenerational justice perspective. She argues these systems embed controversial assumptions about social discounting (devaluing future welfare) and future preferences that significantly influence policy outcomes. AI systems making these assumptions opaque commit a form of hermeneutical injustice: they structure decision-making using frameworks that future generations cannot meaningfully interpret or contest. Sustainable AI requires transparency about embedded assumptions and recognition that optimization-based approaches conceal normative choices affecting future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's concerns about optimization under uncertainty. Halsband shows how AI-supported optimization in long-term planning (for climate policy, but applicable to urban planning) systematically privileges present frameworks while constraining future interpretive capacity. Her analysis strengthens arguments for epistemic humility: when decision-support systems optimize based on assumptions about future preferences, they impose hermeneutical frameworks on future generations who cannot contest them. Option-preservation approaches that acknowledge epistemic uncertainty may be more just than optimization-approaches that embed contestable assumptions in technical systems future generations inherit but cannot challenge.

  CORE ARGUMENT: McCauley et al. synthesize energy justice research, identifying three core dimensions: distributional justice (how costs/benefits are allocated), procedural justice (who participates in decision-making), and recognition justice (respect for diverse values and knowledge systems). They emphasize temporal dimensions of energy justice—decisions about energy infrastructure bind future generations while affecting them unequally. The authors argue energy transitions raise distinctive intergenerational justice concerns because infrastructure choices are long-lived, capital-intensive, and path-dependent, creating lock-in effects that constrain future options.

  RELEVANCE: The framework transfers directly to urban planning, which shares energy infrastructure's characteristics: long-lived, capital-intensive, path-dependent, and binding on future generations. The three dimensions—distributional, procedural, recognition—map onto the project's concerns: distributional (who bears costs of irreversible decisions), procedural (how can absent future people participate), and recognition (what epistemic duties to recognize future values we cannot predict).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gough argues that addressing climate change requires a theory of well-being grounded in universal human needs rather than preferences, happiness, or capabilities. Need-theory provides objective, universalizable, non-substitutable, and satiable criteria for evaluating intergenerational obligations. Unlike preferences (which are subjective, endogenous, and limitless) or happiness (which adapts to circumstances), needs are necessary preconditions for avoiding serious harm across all contexts. Satiability and non-substitutability of needs are critical for sustainability: once needs are met, further accumulation is not morally required, and certain natural goods (clean air, stable climate) cannot be substituted by other goods.

  RELEVANCE: Gough's need-based approach provides resources for thinking about intergenerational obligations under epistemic uncertainty. While we cannot predict future preferences, we can identify universal needs that constrain what we owe them. For the project: even if we cannot know future preferences regarding urban form, we can identify basic needs (housing, mobility, public space, health) that urban planning must preserve. This supports option-preservation over optimization: rather than optimizing for predicted preferences (epistemically uncertain), planning should ensure adequate options for meeting universal needs (epistemically more secure). The argument creates threshold constraints on planning authority: irreversible decisions must preserve conditions for future need-satisfaction, even if we cannot optimize for future preferences.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Green and Brandstedt critique "principles-first" approaches to climate ethics that derive action-guidance by applying general principles to empirical facts. They argue such approaches are indeterminate (leave open crucial normative choices), fail to engage actual agents of change, and are unlikely to influence real-world action. They advocate "engaged methods"—developing normative theory through interaction with actual change agents, allowing their practical contexts and constraints to inform the content of normative principles rather than merely their application. This methodological shift reflects recognition that normative complexity under uncertainty cannot be resolved by mechanical application of general principles.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on climate ethics methodology, the critique applies to intergenerational planning generally. The project can build on Green and Brandstedt's critique of optimization-based approaches: under genuine epistemic uncertainty about future values, principles-first optimization approaches are necessarily indeterminate—they require contestable assumptions about future preferences that cannot be resolved through philosophical analysis alone. This methodological point strengthens the case for epistemic humility: rather than pretending we can derive determinate optimization-solutions through philosophical principles, we should acknowledge irreducible normative uncertainty and preserve options precisely because we cannot resolve these normative questions on behalf of future generations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cass and Campos introduce a special issue examining whether relational egalitarianism—the view that justice requires equal social relationships—can accommodate intergenerational obligations. They frame the challenge: absence of coexistence and other features of intergenerational contexts make it unclear whether many justice ideals apply. Relational egalitarianism appears particularly vulnerable because it explicitly grounds justice in social relations that seem absent between non-overlapping generations. The papers in the volume explore whether relational egalitarianism can extend intergenerationally and what modifications might be required.

  RELEVANCE: While this is an introduction rather than substantive argument, it usefully frames debates about extending justice theories intergenerationally. For the project: the difficulties relational egalitarianism faces in intergenerational contexts highlight potential advantages of alternative approaches. If justice-theories requiring social relations or reciprocity struggle intergenerationally, this opens space for approaches grounded in capacity-respect or harm-avoidance that do not require relations. Epistemic justice theories may have structural advantages here: we can wrong future people epistemically by constraining their interpretive capacities without needing to stand in social relations with them.

  POSITION: Overview of relational egalitarianism and intergenerational justice debates; frames challenges for extending relational theories.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes the economic foundations for understanding why location matters
in housing justice debates. Urban economics demonstrates that agglomeration externalities—
knowledge spillovers, labor market matching, and shared infrastructure—create non-exportable
locational value that is geographically concentrated. The seminal work of Duranton & Puga
(2004) provides the micro-foundations for three types of agglomeration mechanisms: sharing
(reducing costs through pooled resources), matching (improving match quality in thick labor
markets), and learning (facilitating knowledge spillovers). This foundational framework
explains why high-productivity cities generate wage premia that cannot be replicated elsewhere.

The contemporary empirical literature, particularly Hsieh & Moretti (2019), demonstrates
that housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities create massive aggregate costs—
lowering US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009—by preventing workers from accessing
locations with high agglomeration externalities. Ganong & Shoag (2017) show that rising
housing prices in high-income places have fundamentally altered migration patterns, ending
historic income convergence across US regions and redirecting low-skill migration away from
opportunity-rich locations. Recent work documents how housing constraints create spatial
misallocation of labor, with workers unable to move to locations where their productivity
would be highest.

This literature is essential for understanding the "privatization of agglomeration rents"
critique: when housing supply is constrained in high-productivity locations, landowners
capture value created by collective agglomeration externalities, while workers face
higher costs to access these productivity gains. The empirical evidence shows housing
constraints don't merely redistribute value—they destroy aggregate productivity by
preventing efficient spatial allocation of labor.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly grounds the housing justice project's analysis of locational value,
fungibility, and access/occupancy trade-offs. Agglomeration economics demonstrates that
location generates non-exportable value through mechanisms (knowledge spillovers, network
effects, thick labor markets) that cannot be replicated in other places, challenging
any simplistic fungibility assumption. The spatial misallocation literature quantifies
the aggregate costs when housing constraints prevent workers from accessing high-productivity
locations, providing empirical support for why housing access in specific locations matters
for both efficiency and equity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The urban economics literature focuses primarily on aggregate productivity and efficiency
costs, with less attention to distributional justice questions or normative frameworks
for evaluating who should benefit from locational value. Most papers treat housing
constraints as inefficiencies to be corrected rather than examining potential justice-based
reasons for limiting access or distributing locational benefits. The connection between
agglomeration theory and housing justice remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, emphasize how agglomeration mechanisms create genuinely
non-fungible locational value, making housing access in specific places non-substitutable.
Connect spatial misallocation findings to contractualist concerns about fair terms of
social cooperation: constraints that prevent efficient sorting may violate both reasonable
acceptance (by limiting opportunity access) and reciprocity (by allowing rent extraction
without productivity contribution). The empirical magnitude of aggregate costs (36% GDP
growth loss) strengthens arguments that housing constraints in high-productivity areas
impose unreasonable burdens on excluded workers.

- Spatial misallocation: 5 papers - Costs of housing constraints on productivity and sorting

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using a spatial equilibrium model with data from 220 US metropolitan areas, this paper quantifies the aggregate economic cost of housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities. The authors find that stringent housing restrictions in cities like New York and San Francisco effectively limit worker access to high-productivity locations, creating spatial misallocation of labor that lowered aggregate US GDP growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009. The mechanism operates through housing supply constraints preventing workers from moving to cities where their productivity would be highest, despite equilibrium wage differentials that should attract migration.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the central empirical foundation for understanding how housing constraints in high-productivity locations generate massive aggregate costs, not merely redistributive effects. The 36% GDP growth loss quantifies the economic magnitude of preventing access to productive locations, directly supporting arguments that housing constraints impose unreasonable burdens on excluded workers. The spatial misallocation framework demonstrates why location-specific housing access matters—agglomeration externalities create productivity gains that cannot be captured elsewhere, making fungibility arguments fail empirically. This grounds the project's analysis of occupancy/access trade-offs: constraints that benefit current residents by limiting supply impose enormous aggregate costs by preventing efficient spatial sorting.

  doi = {10.1016/j.jue.2017.07.002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper documents a dramatic decline in regional income convergence across US states over the past 30 years, coinciding with disproportionate housing price increases in high-income places. Using a new panel measure of housing supply regulations, the authors demonstrate that rising housing prices in high-income areas deter low-skill migration and slow income convergence. Before 1980, low-income workers migrated to high-income places and experienced income gains; after 1980, housing costs made such migration unprofitable for low-skill workers, who redirected to lower-income locations. The divergence in skill-specific returns to moving to high-income places fundamentally altered US spatial equilibrium.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates how housing constraints transform spatial sorting patterns with profound distributional consequences. Historically, migration to high-income places offered opportunity for low-skill workers; housing price increases have effectively closed this channel, redirecting low-skill migration away from opportunity-rich locations. This directly connects to contractualist concerns about fair opportunity access: housing constraints create spatial segregation by skill level, concentrating low-skill workers in low-productivity areas not by choice but by housing cost barriers. The end of regional income convergence suggests housing constraints violate reasonable acceptance by systematically disadvantaging those who would most benefit from access to high-productivity locations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive handbook chapter provides the theoretical micro-foundations for agglomeration economies, organizing mechanisms into three categories: sharing (indivisible facilities, gains from variety in inputs/outputs, risk-pooling), matching (reducing search/matching frictions, improving match quality in thick markets), and learning (knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face interaction). The authors demonstrate how these mechanisms operate at the level of individual interactions to generate city-level productivity advantages. They distinguish localization economies (same-industry clustering) from urbanization economies (city-size effects) and evaluate empirical evidence for each mechanism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for why location generates non-exportable value, directly addressing fungibility arguments in housing justice debates. The sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms explain why productivity gains from agglomeration cannot be replicated by simply moving to a different location—they depend on the thick markets, specialized infrastructure, and knowledge networks present only in high-density, economically concentrated areas. Knowledge spillovers through face-to-face interaction particularly resist virtualization or geographic substitution. This theoretical framework grounds the project's argument that housing access in specific high-productivity locations is genuinely non-fungible: the value generated by agglomeration externalities is location-specific and non-exportable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This meta-analysis synthesizes empirical evidence on agglomeration externalities from hundreds of studies, finding that urbanization economies (city-size effects) dominate localization economies (industry-specific clustering) in explaining productivity gains. The authors document substantial variation in effect sizes across contexts but confirm robust positive productivity effects from urban density. They identify knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as the most important mechanisms, with effects strongest in knowledge-intensive industries. The paper also examines congestion costs and finds that productivity benefits typically outweigh negative externalities until very high density levels.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive evidence synthesis validates the empirical significance of agglomeration externalities for productivity, supporting arguments that location-specific value is substantial and economically meaningful. The finding that urbanization economies dominate suggests that city-level access matters, not merely access to specific industries—strengthening arguments for broad housing access to high-productivity cities. The identification of knowledge spillovers and labor market pooling as key mechanisms connects to the project's fungibility analysis: these benefits depend on physical proximity and thick markets that cannot be replicated remotely. The balance between agglomeration benefits and congestion costs informs optimal density arguments relevant to housing policy debates.

  pages = {53--80},
  doi = {10.1257/jep.37.2.53},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper documents how housing supply constraints have increasingly shaped US urban development patterns over the past four decades. The author shows that regulatory restrictions and physical constraints (topography, existing development density) have made housing supply increasingly inelastic, particularly in larger and denser metropolitan areas. As a result, demand growth manifests as price increases rather than population/housing quantity increases. This has pushed new construction to urban fringes and driven rapid price appreciation in supply-constrained core areas. The declining responsiveness of housing supply to demand has contributed to both housing affordability crises and inefficient spatial patterns of development.

  RELEVANCE: This paper synthesizes evidence on how housing supply constraints operate and intensify over time, providing institutional context for the spatial misallocation literature. The finding that constraints strengthen with density and city size explains why the most productive locations face the most severe supply restrictions, exacerbating spatial misallocation costs. The paper connects to contractualist analysis by documenting how regulatory barriers—not merely market forces or physical constraints—drive supply inelasticity, raising questions about whether these policy choices can be reasonably accepted by those excluded. The shift toward fringe development rather than core densification illustrates trade-offs between occupancy protection and access expansion.

  doi = {10.1080/00779954.2020.1791939},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using New Zealand data, this paper identifies large and increasing "wedges" between house prices and underlying construction costs, attributing these to the collision of rising demand with housing supply constraints including zoning restrictions. The author shows that regions with larger initial price distortions experienced larger price increases in response to migration shocks, creating economic costs through labor misallocation. A calibrated spatial equilibrium model estimates that comprehensively removing housing supply constraints would have increased New Zealand's GDP by up to 8.4%, with more modest constraint relaxation producing gains of 1-5% of GDP. The paper also documents that constraints contributed to net migration outflows to Australia.

  RELEVANCE: This international evidence demonstrates that spatial misallocation costs from housing constraints are not unique to the US, strengthening the generalizability of Hsieh & Moretti's findings. The identification of large and growing price-cost wedges provides a direct measure of how constraints create economic distortions. The finding that supply-constrained regions experience amplified price responses to demand shocks illustrates how constraints transform demand growth into exclusion rather than accommodation. For housing justice debates, this paper quantifies aggregate costs (up to 8.4% GDP) from supply constraints, raising serious questions about whether such policies can be reasonably accepted when they impose such large burdens on both excluded workers and national productivity.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using matched employer-employee data for the entire Swedish economy (1990-2008), this paper examines how social networks influence productivity in regional agglomerations. The authors construct plant-level co-worker networks and find that increasing network density positively affects productivity, particularly in large, specialized regional industry clusters. Triadic closure (redundant ties) shows negative effects, suggesting non-redundant knowledge access matters most. The paper finds limited support for the intrinsic value of diversity; instead, specialization conditions the benefits of both related-industry linkages and non-local ties.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides micro-level evidence on the mechanisms through which agglomeration externalities operate—specifically, through social networks that facilitate knowledge spillovers and learning. The finding that dense but non-redundant networks drive productivity gains demonstrates why physical proximity in thick labor markets matters: face-to-face interaction builds the network ties that generate agglomeration benefits. This mechanism is inherently non-exportable and location-specific, supporting arguments against housing fungibility. For contractualism, this evidence suggests that access to productive locations provides network benefits that cannot be replicated through remote work or relocation to lower-density areas, strengthening claims that exclusion from high-productivity areas imposes real opportunity costs.

  pages = {1845--1880},
  doi = {10.1111/iere.12724},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using an equilibrium sorting model with Chinese microdata, this paper evaluates the welfare and distributional consequences of dual constraints on mobility (institutional restrictions via hukou system) and housing supply. Counterfactual simulations show that lowering migration costs would increase welfare and reduce inequality by enabling workers to move from inland to coastal regions, but these gains depend critically on housing supply elasticity in receiving regions. The authors demonstrate policy complementarities: the welfare gains from reducing mobility constraints are larger when housing supply is elastic, and vice versa. When both constraints bind simultaneously, they compound each other's negative effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends spatial misallocation analysis to contexts with explicit mobility restrictions, demonstrating how housing supply constraints interact with other barriers to efficient sorting. The finding of policy complementarities is crucial for housing justice debates: even if housing supply were expanded in high-productivity cities, other institutional barriers (in China's case, hukou; in US contexts, potentially exclusionary zoning or discrimination) may prevent efficient sorting. This suggests that addressing housing justice requires coordinated attention to both supply constraints and access barriers. The distributional analysis shows that dual constraints particularly harm low-skill workers who would benefit most from migration to productive locations, connecting to contractualist concerns about reasonable acceptance.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper analyzes how spatial agglomeration externalities affect Italian start-up firm survival, finding that industry variety (especially related variety) reduces firm exit probability. Related variety, which facilitates knowledge generation and diffusion across complementary industries, positively affects manufacturing firm survival, while unrelated variety benefits service sectors through portfolio diversification effects. Localization economies (same-industry concentration) benefit only service sector firms. Urban density effects are not robust to controlling for firm characteristics, suggesting that variety mechanisms dominate pure scale effects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides firm-level evidence that agglomeration benefits operate through specific mechanisms (related variety, knowledge spillovers) rather than simply urban scale, refining understanding of what makes locations valuable. The finding that related variety matters most for manufacturing suggests that access to specific industry ecosystems—not merely any large city—determines productivity and survival. This nuances housing justice arguments: if agglomeration benefits are industry-specific, then housing constraints in particular specialized regions (e.g., tech hubs, financial centers) may have concentrated distributional effects on workers in those fields. The survival analysis demonstrates that location affects not just productivity levels but also firm viability, raising stakes for access debates.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using detailed data from a UK science park, this paper examines how firm co-location decisions respond to agglomeration externalities from neighboring firms. The author finds that firms value proximity to technologically similar neighbors (measured by patent overlap), with effects on innovation output (patent production). The paper provides causal evidence by exploiting quasi-random assignment of locations within the park, showing that firms deliberately "choose the neighbor before the house"—prioritizing proximity to knowledge-related firms over building characteristics. Knowledge spillovers operate at very localized scales (within building or adjacent buildings).

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates the extreme geographic localization of knowledge spillovers, showing that agglomeration benefits operate at building-level proximity in science-intensive contexts. This micro-geographic evidence strengthens arguments against housing fungibility: if productivity benefits require same-building or adjacent-building proximity, then access to specific neighborhoods or even buildings within high-productivity cities matters, not merely city-level access. For housing justice, this suggests that exclusionary practices operating at neighborhood scales (local zoning, building restrictions) can prevent access to highly localized agglomeration benefits, raising questions about whether such fine-grained exclusion can be reasonably accepted.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Focusing on Ecuadorian cantons, this paper investigates whether tertiarization (shift toward services) and urbanization affect agglomeration economies in developing country contexts. Using GMM estimation controlling for endogeneity, the authors find stronger agglomeration effects for services than manufacturing. Critically, they identify a threshold of urbanization (33% urban population) at which diversity, density, and competition externalities all generate positive effects; in highly urbanized areas, congestion effects emerge. Below this threshold, agglomeration benefits are limited or negative.

  RELEVANCE: This developing country context demonstrates that agglomeration benefits are not automatic—they depend on reaching threshold urbanization levels and service sector development. This suggests that the non-fungibility of locational value varies across contexts: in less urbanized or manufacturing-dominant regions, location may matter less for productivity. For housing justice debates, this implies that arguments for access to high-productivity locations have strongest force in contexts that have reached sufficient urbanization and economic complexity to generate agglomeration externalities. The identification of congestion thresholds also informs optimal density debates, suggesting that agglomeration benefits can be exhausted at very high density.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This historical analysis examines the role of industrial structure in labor productivity growth in US manufacturing cities during the "second industrial revolution" (1880-1930). The authors find that initial specialization was associated with faster subsequent productivity growth, demonstrating dynamic Marshallian externalities. Only extremely high levels of diversity (found in a few very large cities) showed positive correlation with growth. The impact of industrial specialization raised labor productivity in manufacturing by approximately 4 percent by 1920.

  RELEVANCE: This historical evidence demonstrates that agglomeration externalities and their productivity effects are not merely contemporary phenomena but have operated throughout industrial development. The finding that specialization drove productivity growth during a transformative economic period suggests that clustering effects are fundamental to innovation and technological change, not just routine production. For housing justice arguments, this long-run historical perspective shows that access to productive locations has shaped economic opportunity and inequality for over a century, suggesting that housing constraints limiting such access have deep structural consequences. The 4% productivity gain from specialization, while smaller than contemporary estimates, operated over just three decades.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Indonesian microdata, this paper quantifies wage premia associated with agglomeration externalities, controlling for individual worker characteristics. The author finds significant positive effects of urban density on wages, with effects larger in service sectors than manufacturing. Specialization and diversity externalities both show positive wage effects, though magnitudes vary by industry. The paper demonstrates that spatial wage differentials in Indonesia reflect productivity differences from agglomeration, not merely cost-of-living differences or worker sorting.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides international evidence that agglomeration externalities translate into measurable wage premia, showing that location-specific productivity gains are captured in worker compensation. The wage premium evidence directly connects to housing justice arguments about access to opportunity: if agglomeration generates higher wages, then housing constraints that prevent workers from accessing high-productivity locations limit both individual earnings and efficient labor allocation. The Indonesian context demonstrates that these effects operate in developing as well as developed economies, suggesting broad relevance. For contractualism, wage premia evidence shows that exclusion from productive locations imposes concrete economic costs on excluded workers.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper empirically investigates sources of spatial wage disparity in Thailand using two-stage estimation with instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity. Results show that worker education and experience affect wage differentials, but workers also benefit from agglomeration externalities of large cities, with effects statistically significant even after controlling for individual characteristics. The effect of agglomeration externalities on wages is substantial, suggesting that Thailand's low urbanization rate and high urban primacy (concentration in Bangkok) limits broader access to agglomeration benefits.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides additional international evidence on how agglomeration externalities translate into wage premia, with particular attention to the distributional consequences of concentrated urbanization. The finding that Thailand's urban primacy limits agglomeration benefit access connects to housing justice concerns about spatial concentration: when agglomeration benefits are geographically concentrated in one dominant city, housing constraints in that city have particularly severe exclusionary effects. The policy recommendation for multiple regional cities suggests that dispersing agglomeration benefits may be preferable to concentrating them, informing debates about optimal spatial distribution of development opportunities.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using micro-level data from Ukrainian manufacturing and service firms (2005, 2013), this paper studies how agglomeration externalities and market structure determine total factor productivity (TFP). The authors find that various agglomeration externalities (specialization, diversity, competition) significantly affect TFP after controlling for firm characteristics (intangible assets, capital intensity, size, ownership, internationalization). Results confirm the importance of agglomeration externalities even in transition economy contexts with less developed market institutions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that agglomeration externalities operate even in contexts with weaker institutions and less developed economies, suggesting that the productivity benefits of clustering are robust across institutional environments. For housing justice arguments, this implies that the efficiency case for enabling access to productive locations applies broadly, not merely in advanced economies with strong market institutions. The finding that both specialization and diversity externalities matter suggests multiple pathways through which location generates value, strengthening arguments that locational value is substantial and non-exportable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines how agglomeration externalities affect new venture survival using Swedish data. The authors find that both specialization (localization) and diversity (urbanization) externalities reduce firm exit probability, with effects varying by industry and firm type. Entrepreneurial firms particularly benefit from diverse urban environments that provide access to variety in knowledge, labor, and resources. The paper demonstrates that location decisions at founding significantly affect long-run firm survival prospects.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides evidence that agglomeration externalities affect not just productivity levels but firm survival, raising stakes for location access. For entrepreneurial workers, access to productive locations may determine whether their ventures succeed or fail, not merely their income levels. This connects to housing justice arguments about opportunity: if housing constraints prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from accessing locations with agglomeration benefits that enable firm survival, such constraints limit not just employment opportunities but also entrepreneurial pathways to economic advancement. The finding that effects are strongest for entrepreneurial firms suggests that housing constraints may particularly harm innovation and new firm formation.

  POSITION: Firm survival analysis emphasizing entrepreneurial benefits from agglomeration.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using comprehensive UK firm-level data (1997-2013), this paper examines the agglomeration externalities generated by fast-growth firms on other firms in the same region and industry. Results show robust evidence of positive spillovers on labor productivity of non-fast-growth firms, demonstrating that high-growth firms generate benefits beyond their own operations. However, externalities on employment growth are negative, suggesting labor poaching and local competition effects. The paper distinguishes between productivity and employment externalities, showing that fast-growth firms generate knowledge spillovers but compete for local labor.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides evidence that agglomeration externalities are not uniformly positive—fast-growth firms generate productivity spillovers but also create competitive pressures through labor market effects. For housing justice debates, this complexity suggests that location value encompasses both benefits (productivity spillovers) and costs (increased competition), with distributional implications. Workers may benefit from proximity to fast-growth firms through productivity spillovers but face wage competition and potential displacement. This nuances arguments about access: the desirability of location depends on whether workers can capture spillover benefits or merely face increased competition and costs.

  POSITION: Agglomeration externalities with attention to both positive spillovers and competitive effects.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper calculates the proportion of jobs at high risk of automation across European regions using 2018 Labor Force Survey data, then examines relationships between automation vulnerability, agglomeration characteristics, and labor market structure. Results indicate that regions at low vulnerability to automation benefit from unrelated variety and high population density, while regions with high concentrations of clerical, craft, and machine operator jobs face greater disruption risk. Agglomeration externalities appear protective against automation risk in knowledge-intensive contexts but offer less protection in routine-task-intensive regions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects agglomeration externalities to future labor market dynamics, showing that the protective value of urban location may vary with automation trends. For housing justice arguments, this suggests that access to productive locations matters not just for current wages but for resilience against technological disruption. Regions with diverse, knowledge-intensive economies offer workers both agglomeration benefits and protection against automation, while routine-task-intensive regions face compounding disadvantages. Housing constraints that prevent workers from accessing automation-resistant locations may impose long-run costs beyond immediate productivity effects, raising intergenerational justice concerns.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines comparative housing systems and the financialization of housing markets, focusing on how different institutional arrangements shape housing's dual role as both necessity and asset. Key debates center on Kemeny's distinction between dualist housing systems (where owner-occupation and social rental compete) versus unitary systems (where private and social rental compete, depressing homeownership). The tenure neutrality debate concerns whether housing policy should favor particular tenure forms or remain neutral. Since the 1980s, housing financialization has transformed housing's economic role across advanced economies through credit liberalization, securitization, and the emergence of housing as a primary wealth store. This has created feedback cycles between finance and property markets, concentrated wealth inequalities, and made housing affordability increasingly dependent on access to credit rather than income alone.

Research shows housing wealth is now more unequally distributed than income in most OECD countries, with implications for intergenerational inequality as parental resources increasingly determine housing outcomes. The financialization process varies across national contexts due to differences in mortgage systems, welfare regimes, and regulatory frameworks, producing distinct varieties of residential capitalism. Asset-based welfare regimes increasingly position homeownership as a substitute for social welfare provision, creating precarity for those excluded from ownership.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the structural context for the dual-role problem. When housing systems financialize and homeownership becomes the normalized tenure, households face the contradiction that Fikse and Aalbers identify: housing must appreciate to serve as wealth store, yet affordability requires low prices. Different housing system designs affect whether this tension is tractable under contractualist standards. Kemeny's dualist/unitary distinction suggests system-level design choices that shape whether the asset/necessity tension can be mediated. The tenure neutrality debate reveals normative questions about whether policy should favor homeownership or maintain neutrality—questions with direct contractualist implications.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical analysis of tenure neutrality as a normative principle. Few studies connect housing system design to distributive justice theories beyond empirical inequality measures. Underdeveloped analysis of how financialization affects the feasibility of different housing institutional designs.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Connect Kemeny's dualist/unitary typology to the dual-role problem's tractability. Examine whether tenure neutrality could serve as a contractualist principle. Analyze how financialization constrains or enables different system designs. Consider whether comparative evidence suggests any system successfully mediates the asset/necessity tension.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Kemeny dualist/unitary systems (4 papers): Housing system typology based on rental sector organization
- Tenure neutrality advocates (3 papers): Policy should not favor particular tenures
- Financialization critics (7 papers): Credit-driven housing transformation creates inequality and instability
- Asset-based welfare analysts (4 papers): Homeownership increasingly substitutes for welfare provision

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ryan-Collins argues housing affordability and wealth inequality crises stem from a feedback cycle between finance and landed property, created by pro-homeownership policy coupled with credit liberalization. Under these conditions, land becomes the most attractive collateral for banks and the most desirable asset for households, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where credit expansion drives house prices, which justifies further lending. This housing-finance cycle emerged in Anglo-Saxon economies in the 1980s but has spread globally.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is foundational for understanding the dual-role problem's emergence. The feedback cycle Ryan-Collins describes explains why the asset/necessity tension intensifies over time: as housing financializes, price appreciation becomes structurally necessary to validate lending and household wealth strategies, making affordability increasingly incompatible with the system's operation. The paper's focus on demand-side reforms (banking regulation, land policy) versus supply-side reforms directly addresses policy tractability under contractualist constraints.

  POSITION: Represents the political economy critique of housing financialization, arguing the crisis requires macroeconomic policy reform rather than merely increasing supply. This contrasts with supply-focused approaches that dominate policy discourse.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fikse and Aalbers identify a fundamental contradiction between homeownership discourses (affordable homeownership, conservative finance, asset-based welfare, tenure neutrality) and reality (declining affordability, risky finance, unequal wealth distribution, lack of tenure neutrality) in Belgium. They argue financialized homeownership undermines its own ideological foundations—the more housing functions as financial asset, the less it can function as affordable social necessity. This "really big contradiction" echoes Kemeny's "really big trade-off" but focuses on internal contradictions within homeownership ideology itself.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly articulates the dual-role problem at the heart of this research project. The Belgian case demonstrates how financialization makes the asset/necessity tension irreconcilable within a homeowner society: policies that support housing as wealth store systematically undermine affordability. The four discourses they identify (especially tenure neutrality) reveal how policy rhetoric obscures this contradiction. Their finding that discourses persist despite contradictory reality suggests ideological rigidity that may constrain contractualist reform.

  POSITION: Critical of financialized homeownership, showing contradictions between policy discourse and outcomes. Builds on Kemeny while extending analysis to financialization era.

  title = {The Myth Of Home Ownership: Private Versus Public Choices In Housing Tenure},
  year = {1981},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kemeny's foundational work challenges the ideological assumption that homeownership is inherently superior to renting, arguing this "myth" obscures genuine policy choices about housing provision. He introduces the distinction between dualist housing systems (where social rental is residualized and competes with homeownership) and unitary systems (where non-profit and private rental compete, with homeownership less dominant). Kemeny argues homeownership ideology serves class interests by privatizing housing security while reducing pressure for comprehensive welfare provision—the "really big trade-off" between homeownership and welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Kemeny provides the foundational typology for understanding how housing system design affects the dual-role problem. His dualist/unitary distinction suggests system-level structural choices that shape whether housing can simultaneously serve as necessity and asset. Dualist systems may intensify the dual-role tension by making homeownership the only path to housing security, while unitary systems might ease it by providing quality rental alternatives. His critique of homeownership ideology is essential for contractualist analysis of whether pro-homeownership policy can be justified.

  POSITION: Foundational critical perspective on homeownership ideology, establishing the comparative housing systems framework that shapes subsequent research. Argues for rethinking housing tenure as political choice rather than natural preference.

  volume = {53},
  pages = {970--996},
  doi = {10.1017/S0047279422000770},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl et al. present new long-run data on social housing shares across 48 countries since 1900, documenting the "rise and fall" of housing decommodification. They identify three housing groups: residual (Anglo-Saxon), socialist, and Northern European (where public housing remained resilient). Contrary to classical welfare state theories, social housing is better explained by housing shortages and complementarities with rental policies than by GDP or left-wing government. The decline was steep but uneven—some countries maintained substantial social sectors through resilient public housing associations.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides empirical grounding for assessing whether decommodified housing sectors can mediate the dual-role problem. The finding that social housing persisted where rental policies were strong suggests system-level complementarities matter more than simple welfare-state capacity. The long-run perspective reveals that housing decommodification trajectories differ from classical welfare state patterns, suggesting housing requires distinct institutional analysis. For contractualism, the question is whether robust social housing provision could reduce dependence on homeownership as wealth store, easing the dual-role tension.

  POSITION: Empirical comparative-historical approach documenting varieties of housing decommodification. Challenges conventional housing typologies by showing they lack temporal stability. Argues for including housing in welfare state research rather than treating it as separate domain.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Blackwell and Kohl argue that cross-sectional housing typologies (welfare-regime or varieties-of-capitalism based) lack temporal validity. Using long-run data, they show postulated associations between homeownership, welfare, and mortgage debt are historically contingent. They propose historicized typologies that trace housing finance system trajectories and acknowledge path-dependence. Housing systems evolved through distinct historical pathways that cannot be reduced to contemporary welfare-regime or VoC categories, requiring longitudinal analysis that accommodates within-country and between-country variation over time.

  RELEVANCE: This methodological critique is crucial for the project because it warns against assuming housing system types are stable or determined by welfare regime. The dual-role problem may manifest differently across historical contexts even within the same country. For contractualist analysis, this suggests institutional design proposals must account for path-dependence and historical contingency—what works in one context may not transfer. The paper's emphasis on housing finance trajectories also highlights how mortgage system evolution constrains contemporary reform possibilities.

  POSITION: Methodological intervention arguing for path-dependent, historically sensitive comparative housing research. Critiques static typologies that dominate housing studies. Emphasizes housing finance systems as drivers of divergence.

  doi = {10.1080/09692290.2017.1403358},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Blackwell and Kohl develop the first historically informed typology of housing finance systems, identifying four "ideal types" that emerged in the 19th century: informal person-to-person lending, state lending (solutions outside banking), and deposit-based and bond-based institutions (banking solutions). They adapt Gerschenkron's economic backwardness thesis to explain temporal and spatial emergence, arguing these systems created path-dependent logics whose influence persists over a century later. Early housing finance institutions shaped national trajectories in lasting ways.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explains why mortgage finance systems differ so dramatically across countries—differences that profoundly affect housing financialization and the dual-role problem's intensity. Countries with different mortgage finance origins face different constraints on policy reform. The path-dependence argument suggests that contemporary financialization, while global, operates through nationally specific institutional channels inherited from much earlier periods. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether finance system reform is tractable or locked-in by historical institutional legacies.

  POSITION: Historical institutionalist approach to housing finance. Emphasizes long-run path-dependence from 19th century institutional choices. Provides analytical framework for understanding cross-national mortgage system variation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fuller et al. demonstrate that the political-institutional determinants of income inequality have no effect on wealth-to-income ratios. Instead, rising wealth inequality is driven by housing price increases and other financial asset appreciation, not by homeownership rates or savings rates. This finding challenges both comparative political economy's focus on income inequality and housing studies' focus on ownership rates. The rise in wealth-to-income ratios is fundamentally about asset price inflation, particularly housing, and will increasingly shape intergenerational and class-based political conflict.

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes that wealth inequality is now decoupled from income inequality and driven primarily by housing price dynamics. For the dual-role problem, this is critical: housing's function as wealth store depends on price appreciation, which directly undermines affordability. The finding that homeownership rates don't drive wealth inequality suggests the problem isn't ownership per se but price dynamics. This has major contractualist implications—policies addressing housing wealth inequality must target price dynamics rather than merely expanding ownership. The intergenerational dimension highlights contractualist concerns about fairness across age cohorts.

  POSITION: Political economy analysis challenging conventional CPE frameworks by foregrounding wealth over income. Emphasizes housing prices as driver of wealth inequality independent of welfare-state or ownership-rate variables.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benites-Gambirazio and Bonneval analyze France as an intermediary housing regime case, tracing how pro-homeownership policies since the 1970s combined with welfare retrenchment and pension reforms from the 1990s to create a distinct Housing Asset-Based Welfare (HABW) regime. Despite France's strong social welfare tradition, policies increasingly positioned homeownership as private wealth strategy, advancing "ordinary financialization" with rising household debt-to-income ratios and unequal homeownership access effects. France exemplifies how asset-based welfare can develop even in strong welfare states.

  RELEVANCE: The French case is crucial because it shows housing financialization and asset-based welfare emerging even in a context with robust social protections—suggesting these are not simply Anglo-Saxon phenomena but broader trends across welfare regime types. This complicates the dual-role problem because it suggests even strong welfare states may be unable to prevent housing's transformation into financial asset. The finding that asset-based welfare develops through combination of pro-homeownership policy and welfare reform indicates the dual-role tension may be policy-constructed rather than inevitable. This has implications for contractualist feasibility: perhaps different policy combinations could prevent or reverse this development.

  POSITION: Extends housing asset-based welfare concept to non-Anglo-Saxon context. Shows financialization compatible with various welfare regime types. Analyzes "ordinary financialization" at household level.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bryant et al. argue household financialization complicates comparative analysis because wealth inequality patterns don't follow classical welfare state categories, though mean wealth levels do. National patterns of wealth inequality reflect asset-based welfare mechanisms centered on housing ownership, inadequately captured by existing welfare-state or VoC literature. They show mortgage default rates following the 2007-08 crisis reflected welfare state categories rather than financial risk measures, revealing an emerging "hybrid" role where social insurance supports household liquidity and asset-based strategies.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that asset-based welfare creates distinct inequality patterns not predicted by welfare regime theory, while maintaining links to welfare state structures. The finding that default rates followed welfare categories rather than financial risk suggests welfare states shape how housing financialization affects households—some welfare states may buffer household risk from housing finance while others don't. This is crucial for contractualism: institutional context determines whether housing asset strategies create precarity or security. The hybrid welfare-finance interaction suggests complexity in reforming housing systems within existing welfare arrangements.

  pages = {43--60},
  doi = {10.1080/14616718.2014.997431},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aalbers argues the housing crisis stems from the shift to post-Fordist financialized neoliberalism beginning in the 1970s. What appeared as the "Great Moderation" of macroeconomic cycles was actually a "Great Excess" of rising inequality and credit expansion. The crisis wasn't caused by this shift but rather culminated from dynamics introduced decades earlier when states financialized and housing became central to finance-led accumulation. Financialization of housing is thus a critical juncture producing path-dependent dynamics that culminated in crisis.

  RELEVANCE: Aalbers provides the periodization framework for understanding housing financialization's development and the dual-role problem's intensification. His argument that the crisis was built into the post-Fordist housing model suggests the dual-role tension may be structurally irresolvable under financialized conditions without fundamental system change. The critical junctures framework (1970s-80s and post-2007) suggests moments when path-dependence could have been altered. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether incremental reform is possible or whether the housing-finance-inequality nexus requires systemic transformation.

  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2015.1109545},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dewilde and De Decker evaluate whether housing financialization correlates with changing inequalities in housing outcomes for low-income owners and private renters across 11-13 Western European countries (1995-2012). They find that increased financialization associates with deteriorating affordability for low-income households relative to middle-income counterparts, controlling for income trends and inequality. Declining affordability was not compensated by improved housing conditions. This trend pre-dates the 2008 crisis, already apparent 1995-2007, suggesting financialization rather than crisis per se drives inequality.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides systematic comparative evidence that housing financialization increases inequality in housing outcomes, specifically harming low-income households' relative position. This directly bears on the dual-role problem: as housing financializes, the affordability dimension deteriorates for those with low incomes even as housing's wealth function strengthens for owners. The finding that this trend preceded the 2008 crisis suggests structural rather than cyclical dynamics. For contractualism, this raises questions about whether any reasonable person would accept institutional arrangements that systematically worsen housing affordability for the least advantaged through financialization.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl and Wood challenge the view that rising house prices drive fiscal austerity. Using econometric analysis of 19 advanced economies 1980-2018, they show house prices have positive effects on taxation revenue and fiscal spending on public investment, welfare, and education. Multi-level analysis reveals parties respond to rising house prices by proposing more welfare spending. Conterminously rising house prices and rents lead to greater welfare spending, suggesting governments use fiscal policy to protect non-homeowners from labor market risks while supporting house price growth for homeowners.

  RELEVANCE: This finding complicates the dual-role problem by revealing fiscal-housing dynamics. Governments may simultaneously support house price appreciation (benefiting homeowners) while increasing welfare spending (compensating renters/non-owners). This suggests political management of housing's dual role through fiscal redistribution rather than housing policy itself. For contractualism, this raises questions: is fiscal compensation for rising housing costs justifiable, or does it fail to address the underlying problem? Does this create unsustainable fiscal pressures? The finding that parties respond to housing coalitions suggests democratic politics may be structurally biased toward homeowners.

  doi = {10.1017/SSH.2021.16},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kohl and Sørvoll explain divergence between Nordic and German-speaking housing regimes through differences in social-democratic ideology and cooperative traditions. Nordic countries moved toward Anglo-Saxon levels of homeownership, mortgage debt, and price increases, while German-speaking countries maintained lower homeownership, private tenancy, lower indebtedness, and stable prices. From the 1920s, Norway developed owner cooperatives (supported by pro-ownership social democracy) while Germany developed tenant cooperatives (supported by anti-ownership social democracy). These differential cooperative pathways created lasting divergence.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that political ideology and organizational form choices in earlier periods profoundly shape contemporary housing system outcomes, including the dual-role problem's intensity. The Nordic trajectory toward high homeownership and debt suggests pro-ownership social democracy may inadvertently intensify the asset/necessity tension, while German tenant cooperatives may ease it by maintaining affordable rental alternatives. For contractualism, this historical analysis shows ideological commitments about property and cooperation have long-run institutional consequences that outlast the ideologies themselves. Current housing system constraints reflect past political choices.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Christophers argues understanding and addressing housing asset-based inequalities requires analyzing ownership and rental relationally rather than focusing solely on ownership. Tenure inequality (ideological and economic inequality between ownership and rental) is root cause of asset-based inequality. Using UK and Swedish cases, he shows significant asset inequalities emerged through policy-driven tenure inequality where ownership became privileged over rental. (Re)instituting tenure equality principles should be primary political-policy objective to reduce property asset inequalities and prevent intergenerational reproduction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides crucial normative framing for the dual-role problem by arguing tenure inequality is fundamental. If ownership is systematically privileged over rental (through subsidies, ideology, policy), housing's asset function necessarily creates inequality because only owners access wealth accumulation while renters face affordability pressures without wealth benefits. Christophers' argument for tenure equality as policy principle directly parallels contractualist concerns about reasonable rejection: would reasonable persons accept institutional arrangements that systematically privilege one tenure over another? His analysis suggests addressing dual-role problem requires tenure-neutral policy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Arundel challenges the "ideology of mass homeownership" as equalizing mechanism, showing housing equity is starkly concentrated with significant inter- and intra-generational divergences in Britain. Secondary rental-property markets present key dimension of wealth concentration. Younger cohorts face especially disadvantaged prospects. Rooted ideologies of housing-asset-based economic security become questionable in an era of individualized welfare responsibility and concentrated housing wealth.

  RELEVANCE: This paper documents empirical patterns of housing wealth concentration that undermine homeownership's ideological justification as democratizing wealth. For the dual-role problem, this is critical: if housing's wealth function is highly unequal and concentrated among older owner households and secondary property owners, then homeownership cannot serve as general wealth-building strategy while also providing affordable necessity. Arundel's findings on private landlordism suggest financialization creates new investor class extracting rents from non-owners, intensifying the dual-role tension. Intergenerational inequality raises contractualist fairness concerns.

  POSITION: Empirical analysis challenging homeownership ideology through wealth inequality data. Emphasizes intergenerational dimensions and secondary property ownership. Questions asset-based welfare paradigm.

  doi = {10.1177/0042098017711649},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wetzstein identifies an under-recognized emergent global crisis of urban housing affordability resulting from housing expenses rising faster than wages in many urban centers worldwide. This is triggered by post-GFC megatrends: accelerated (re)urbanization of capital and people, cheap credit provision, and rising intra-society inequality. He argues for politicized knowledge production toward achieving affordable urban futures, linking affordability to political-economic spheres of state-market governance, regulation, policy and investment.

  RELEVANCE: This paper frames housing affordability as global crisis rather than local problem, important for recognizing the dual-role problem's scope. The three megatrends Wetzstein identifies (urbanization, credit, inequality) directly relate to housing financialization and the asset/necessity tension. His call for examining state-market governance questions speaks to contractualist concerns about institutional design. The policy-outcome gap he identifies suggests existing policies fail to address the crisis, raising questions about whether incremental reform is sufficient or fundamental restructuring required.

  POSITION: Policy-oriented urban studies perspective framing affordability as urgent global crisis. Emphasizes need for comparative research linking policy to outcomes. Calls for political engagement in knowledge production.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bezemer et al. document the decline of bank credit to non-financial firms relative to credit for real estate and financial assets since the 1990s, raising concerns about growth and stability. They examine credit policies' theoretical case and post-war use, tracing their demise during 1980s market-oriented reconfiguration including pro-homeownership policies favoring mortgages. Empirical analysis of 17 advanced economies 1973-2005 shows credit policy decline significantly associates with lower lending share to non-financial firms. Credit policies may support adequate financing for innovation, industrial development, and low-carbon transition.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals how policy shifts favoring mortgage credit over productive lending contributed to housing financialization and the debt shift toward households. The finding that credit policy decline associates with less business lending shows trade-offs: channeling credit toward housing mortgages means less credit for productive investment. This has direct implications for the dual-role problem: policies supporting housing as wealth store (via mortgage credit availability) may reduce economic dynamism. For contractualism, this raises questions about intergenerational fairness—are credit policies that favor housing over productive investment justifiable?

  POSITION: Political economy analysis of credit allocation and financial regulation. Documents shift from direct credit policies to market-based allocation. Links housing finance to broader productive investment patterns.

  doi = {10.1111/ajes.12387},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ryan-Collins examines links between private landed property (PLP) and finance across history. PLP supported modern banking/credit growth, industrialization, and economic democratization. Since 1980s, however, high-income economies' strong PLP preference (homeownership) combined with financial liberalization created land-finance feedback cycle with negative outcomes: affordability crisis for younger/poorer groups, rising wealth inequality as land rents concentrate, economic stagnation via capital misallocation, and financial fragility from household debt. Alternative tenure arrangements and finance/taxation reforms could mediate these dynamics.

  RELEVANCE: This historical analysis provides crucial long-run perspective on housing-finance relationship, showing it's not inherently problematic but becomes so under specific conditions. The land-finance feedback cycle Ryan-Collins describes is the structural mechanism driving the dual-role problem's intensification. His finding that outcomes vary by tenure arrangements and regulation suggests contractualist feasibility: institutional design choices can shape whether housing-finance interactions produce inequality and instability. The focus on Anglo-Saxon "home-owning democracies" provides comparative context showing problem isn't universal but regime-specific.

  POSITION: Historical political economy analysis linking property systems to finance. Shows housing-finance relationship is historically contingent and shaped by policy. Argues current arrangements produce inequality but alternatives exist.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The applied ethics of housing justice has emerged as a significant field within political philosophy over the last decade, responding to housing crises across Western liberal democracies. The domain encompasses philosophical work on housing rights, homelessness, affordability obligations, and housing allocation, bridging normative theory to policy analysis. Key debates center on whether there exists a human right to housing (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), what states owe to those experiencing homelessness (Essert 2016), how affordability obligations should be distributed, and which ethical frameworks—human rights, capabilities, or contractualism—best address housing justice.

The field divides into several interconnected areas: (1) foundational rights-based approaches arguing for basic housing rights (Wells 2019, Shue 2020), often grounded in dignity, autonomy, or basic needs; (2) capabilities-based approaches (Kimhur 2024, Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user 2025) that focus on what people are able to do and be with respect to housing; (3) applied analyses of specific housing phenomena like gentrification (Dawkins 2023, Lloyd 2023) and housing wealth accumulation (Erck 2024); and (4) recent survey work synthesizing the state of the field (Halliday & Meyer 2024). Essert's (2016) work on homelessness and property rights stands as a foundational text examining state obligations to provide shelter. Wells (2019) offers a distinctive liberal account defending a right to autonomous dwelling. Recent work has expanded to include limitarianism applied to housing (Erck 2024) and integration of relational egalitarian concerns (Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user 2025).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project as it provides the specific applied philosophical literature on housing that contractualist approaches must engage. Understanding existing frameworks—particularly human rights and capabilities approaches—is essential for positioning contractualism's distinctive contributions. The project seeks to show where contractualism adds value and where it faces challenges from these competing frameworks. Papers like Wells (2019), Kimhur (2024), and Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user (2025) represent the state-of-the-art against which a contractualist account must be developed and defended.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial work on housing rights and gentrification, there is limited philosophical engagement with: (1) the macroeconomic and fiscal policy dimensions of housing justice (noted by Halliday & Meyer 2024); (2) explicit contractualist frameworks applied to housing (most work draws on human rights, capabilities, or relational egalitarianism); (3) comparative analysis across different housing tenure systems; and (4) philosophical analysis of housing financialization and its justice implications.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should organize papers around competing normative frameworks (rights-based, capabilities, relational equality) while attending to specific issues (homelessness, gentrification, affordability, allocation). Pay special attention to methodological debates about how housing justice should be theorized and whether housing requires a distinctive approach beyond general distributive justice. The recent survey by Halliday & Meyer (2024) provides an excellent roadmap of the field's current state and future directions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Human rights approach: 6 papers - Housing as basic right grounded in dignity, autonomy, or subsistence (Wells, Shue, Essert)
- Capabilities approach: 4 papers - Housing justice as enabling functionings and capabilities (Kimhur, Dummer & Neuh\u00e4user, Taylor)
- Applied analyses: 5 papers - Specific housing issues through justice lens (gentrification, limitarianism, allocation)
- Survey/overview: 3 papers - State of field and integration (Halliday & Meyer, Shue updated edition)

  volume = {67},
  pages = {406--421},
  doi = {10.1177/0032321718769009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wells defends a basic right to housing specific to Western liberal societies, arguing for a positive right to exercise "lease rights" over a self-contained living space of adequate standard for minimum 3 years. Crucially, she argues this is a right to live alone—communal housing imposed by resource scarcity violates basic rights. The account grounds housing rights in autonomy and the distinctive importance of having a stable, private dwelling space.

  RELEVANCE: Wells provides one of the most developed philosophical defenses of a right to housing in recent literature. Her autonomy-based argument offers a clear alternative to contractualist approaches, and her emphasis on the right to autonomous dwelling (not just shelter) raises important questions about what contractualism must deliver. Her focus on Western liberal contexts parallels this project's scope, making direct comparison feasible.

  POSITION: Liberal rights-based approach grounding housing rights in individual autonomy and the value of having one's own dwelling space, with emphasis on stability and privacy as basic rights.

  volume = {44},
  pages = {266--295},
  doi = {10.1111/PAPA.12080},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Essert examines the relationship between private property rights and homelessness, arguing that property institutions that fail to ensure everyone has access to shelter are morally deficient. He develops an account of what the state owes to those experiencing homelessness, arguing that property rights carry with them obligations to ensure basic shelter. The state's enforcement of property rights against the homeless is justified only if alternative shelter is genuinely available.

  RELEVANCE: This is foundational work on homelessness ethics that any contractualist account must engage. Essert's focus on the moral requirements property institutions must meet to be legitimate resonates with contractualist concerns about justification. His analysis of state obligations toward the homeless addresses questions central to what reasonable persons could not reject regarding housing allocation. Essential for understanding how contractualism should approach the most severe housing deprivation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive survey maps the emerging field of housing justice philosophy, identifying five major areas: the value of home, homelessness, gentrification, segregation, and spatial justice. The authors highlight recent contributions while identifying critical gaps, particularly the lack of philosophical engagement with macroeconomic factors (fiscal and monetary policy) affecting housing justice. They advocate for normative approaches beyond human flourishing and relational equality frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most current survey of philosophical work on housing justice and provides essential context for positioning contractualist contributions. Halliday and Meyer's identification of gaps in the literature—especially regarding macroeconomic policy and alternative normative frameworks—suggests space for contractualist approaches. Their call for frameworks beyond flourishing and relational equality directly invites consideration of contractualist alternatives. Critical for understanding the state of the art and where this project fits.

  volume = {39},
  pages = {481--501},
  doi = {10.1080/02673037.2022.2056148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kimhur develops a capabilities approach to housing justice, arguing that housing policy should focus on expanding people's capabilities for housing rather than merely distributing resources or housing units. She proposes evaluating housing justice through three dimensions: housing opportunities, housing securities, and housing abilities. This shifts focus from absolute distributional principles to changes in people's capabilities to lead valued ways of residing.

  RELEVANCE: This represents the most developed recent application of the capability approach to housing justice. Understanding Kimhur's framework is essential for assessing what contractualism offers that capabilities approaches do not. Her focus on bridging ideals and policy practices parallels contractualist concerns about practicability. The project must explain whether contractualism provides different or better policy guidance than her capabilities framework, and whether reasonable rejection can address issues capabilities approaches cannot.

  journal = {Journal of Applied Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.70020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dummer and Neuh\u00e4user critically examine the capability approach to housing justice, focusing on Nussbaum's list of basic capabilities. They argue the list inadequately captures fundamental housing justice concerns and requires integration of relational egalitarian considerations. Specifically, they develop self-respect as a basic capability incorporating relational dimensions, arguing an adequate capabilitarian view must address relational aspects of housing beyond individual functionings.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is crucial because it identifies limitations in pure capability approaches and argues for integration of relational concerns—a move that brings capabilities closer to contractualist territory. Their critique suggests space for contractualism to address what capabilities approaches miss. The focus on self-respect and relational dimensions resonates with contractualist concerns about standing and reasonable rejection. Essential for understanding how contractualism might improve on or complement capabilities frameworks.

  POSITION: Modified capabilities approach integrating relational egalitarian concerns, particularly self-respect, as essential to adequate housing justice theory.

  title = {Basic Rights},
  year = {2020},
  edition = {40th Anniversary},
  doi = {10.2307/761904},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shue's classic work on basic rights, updated for its 40th anniversary, argues that subsistence rights (including adequate housing) along with security and liberty rights form the foundation of all other rights. The updated edition includes a new chapter examining how climate change progressively undermines subsistence bases including water, food, and safe housing. Basic rights are those whose enjoyment is essential to the enjoyment of all other rights, making them morally basic.

  RELEVANCE: Though not exclusively about housing, Shue's framework is foundational for human rights approaches to housing justice. His argument that adequate housing is a basic right because necessary for enjoying other rights provides a key alternative to contractualist justifications. The climate change chapter adds urgency to housing rights claims. Essential for understanding how human rights theorists ground housing rights and what contractualism must explain differently or better. The basic rights framework is a major competitor to contractualist approaches in applied ethics.

  pages = {261--281},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2023.2181863},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dawkins provides a systematic taxonomy of eight distinct injustices associated with gentrification: deprivation, estrangement, erasure, domination, censure, exploitation, disrespect, and marginalization. He argues that understanding gentrification's injustice requires recognizing its plural and contested nature, with domination appearing both as a distinct injustice and as contributing to other forms. The state has ultimate moral obligation to rectify these injustices through institutional reform, not merely to blame individual actors.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive analysis of gentrification injustices is essential for understanding a major applied housing justice issue. Dawkins's pluralistic framework identifying multiple forms of injustice resonates with contractualist concerns about different grounds for reasonable rejection. His emphasis on domination and institutional obligations aligns with contractualist focus on structural justification. The project must address whether contractualism can adequately capture the plural forms of gentrification injustice Dawkins identifies, or whether it reduces them problematically.

  pages = {1246--1264},
  doi = {10.1080/07352166.2023.2216889},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lloyd argues that philosophical critiques of gentrification have overemphasized residential displacement while neglecting other harms. He contends that even non-displacement gentrification damages local communities by undermining the goods conferred by membership in thriving community. Drawing on social science, he argues gentrification threatens relational equality and violates occupancy rights even without displacement. He proposes Lockean and Walzerian frameworks for critiquing community-damaging gentrification.

  RELEVANCE: Lloyd's focus on community goods and relational dimensions of gentrification injustice beyond displacement provides important perspective for contractualist approaches. His emphasis on occupancy rights grounded in communal labor resonates with contractualist concerns about what participants in social cooperation are owed. The project should consider whether contractualism can better explain the wrongness of community destruction than the Lockean and Walzerian alternatives Lloyd proposes. His theoretically ecumenical approach models pluralistic engagement this project should emulate.

  volume = {42},
  pages = {139--154},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2024.2391424},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Erck develops "housing limitarianism"—the doctrine that it is morally wrong to own excess housing while others lack adequate housing, and that governments should limit excessive housing acquisition/consumption. Building on Robeyns's limitarianism, she employs Rawls's property-owning democracy ideal to argue for dispersing homeownership throughout society. She addresses the apparent tension between increasing affordable housing supply and wildlife habitat preservation.

  RELEVANCE: This novel application of limitarianism to housing introduces upper limits on housing wealth as a justice concern. For a contractualist approach, this raises questions about whether reasonable persons could reject principles allowing unlimited housing accumulation. Erck's Rawlsian framing makes the paper especially relevant for assessing contractualism against Rawlsian alternatives. Her attention to environmental justice dimensions (housing vs. wildlife habitat) highlights trade-offs contractualism must address. Important for considering whether contractualism supports housing wealth limits.

  journal = {Politics, Philosophy \& Economics},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594x251330912},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kogelmann critically examines the argument that zoning is justified because it facilitates autonomy. After charitable reconstruction, he presents what he considers a decisive objection: while autonomy arguments for zoning ultimately fail, reflecting on the relationship between zoning and autonomy reveals problems with common arguments that gentrification harms autonomy and with typical remedies for gentrification. The analysis shows how autonomy concerns cut against both pro-zoning and anti-gentrification positions.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is important for understanding how autonomy-based arguments function (or fail) in housing contexts. Since Wells (2019) grounds housing rights in autonomy, Kogelmann's critique has implications for autonomy-based approaches generally. His analysis of how autonomy considerations interact with property rights, zoning, and gentrification is relevant for contractualist frameworks that must balance personal autonomy against collective concerns. The paper models philosophical engagement with housing policy instruments.

  title = {Just Shelter: Gentrification, Integration, Race, and Reconstruction},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sundstrom develops a comprehensive theory of spatial justice emphasizing racial justice dimensions. He argues that achieving justice in social-spatial arrangements requires prioritizing moral equality, liberty, distributive justice, equal citizenship, and—given US history of housing discrimination—corrective justice through rectification programs. His account centers racial justice as fundamental to housing justice rather than peripheral concern.

  RELEVANCE: Sundstrom's emphasis on corrective justice for historical racial injustice in housing is crucial for any contractualist account of US housing justice. His framework raises questions about whether contractualism can adequately address backward-looking obligations and structural racism in housing. The integration of spatial justice with racial justice shows how housing justice cannot be treated in isolation from broader social justice concerns. Important for understanding how contractualism must address housing's racial dimensions.

  pages = {311--316},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2019.1708453},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor responds to capabilities approaches to housing policy by arguing that Rawls's theory of justice should not be dismissed as purely resource-focused but can contribute to normative policy evaluation. She suggests Rawls's framework can assist in developing capabilities-based housing policy analysis, proposing integration rather than opposition between Rawlsian and capabilities approaches.

  RELEVANCE: This short paper is valuable for understanding debates about how different justice frameworks relate to housing policy evaluation. Taylor's suggestion that Rawlsian approaches complement rather than compete with capabilities approaches is relevant for considering how contractualist frameworks might integrate with or improve on capabilities approaches. The focus on practical policy evaluation aligns with contractualist concerns about action-guidance.

  pages = {305--310},
  doi = {10.1080/14036096.2019.1705387},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Batterham raises three critical issues for capabilities approaches to housing: (1) the process for deriving and specifying housing-related capabilities must be clear and defensible; (2) there must be explicit connection between the concept of justice and housing capabilities; (3) there is need for discussion of different ways to understand causes of capability deprivation, as this affects policy responses. She argues these issues require resolution to realize capabilities approach's promise for housing.

  RELEVANCE: This critical commentary identifies methodological challenges capabilities approaches face in housing contexts—challenges contractualist approaches must either solve or avoid. The emphasis on clear derivation procedures resonates with contractualist insistence on justification through reasonable rejection. The concern about linking justice concepts to specific capabilities is directly relevant to contractualist methodology. Important for understanding what any normative framework for housing must accomplish.

  doi = {10.1111/papa.12281},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Christmas argues that housing affordability crises in major cities result from political constraints on supply that raise normative questions. He contends these constraints fail to protect residents' normative interests and prohibit mutually beneficial development. Drawing on liberty-based justifications for property rights, he argues rights over commonly used urban space should be assigned to those most local to it, enabling housing expansion through procedures ensuring local benefit.

  RELEVANCE: Christmas provides a distinctively libertarian approach to housing justice focused on removing supply constraints. His liberty-based framework offers a counterpoint to capabilities and human rights approaches, raising questions about whether contractualism should support deregulatory housing policies. The emphasis on mutually beneficial development resonates with contractualist concerns about arrangements all could reasonably accept. Important for understanding libertarian alternatives to welfare-state approaches to housing justice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Das examines AI-aided allocation of scarce societal resources including housing for homeless people. He argues for closer engagement with political philosophy literature on local justice, which provides frameworks for how societies have framed objectives for allocation problems. The paper explores how ubiquitous data and predictive algorithms create new opportunities and risks for resource allocation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects housing allocation issues to algorithmic fairness and local justice theory. For contractualism, it raises questions about what principles should govern algorithmic allocation systems and whether reasonable persons could reject opaque AI-driven allocation. The focus on homeless housing allocation connects to Essert's concerns about state obligations.

  doi = {10.1177/20539517231202983},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zhang distinguishes two concepts of reparations relevant to algorithmic housing justice: reparations as accountability/redress for past injustice, and reparations as constructive worldmaking focused on present/future justice. She applies these to US housing injustice, proposing three interpretations: litigating algorithmic discrimination, computing damages for historical structural injustice, and repurposing algorithms for radical resistance linking reform to structural change.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses algorithmic dimensions of housing injustice, connecting to Das's work on algorithmic allocation. The distinction between backward-looking redress and forward-looking worldmaking is relevant for contractualist approaches that must address both historical housing injustice and future institutional design. Zhang's attention to how algorithmic methods might serve housing justice (not just threaten it) is important for policy-oriented contractualist work.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lancione develops a care ethics approach to radical housing justice. While abstract is unavailable, the title suggests examination of how care ethics frameworks might ground more radical approaches to housing justice that go beyond conventional welfare-state interventions. The piece likely explores tensions between care-based and rights-based approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Care ethics represents another major normative framework (alongside rights, capabilities, and contractualism) for housing justice. Understanding how care ethics approaches housing is relevant for assessing contractualism's distinctive contribution. The emphasis on "radical" housing justice suggests attention to transformative rather than merely ameliorative approaches—a dimension contractualist frameworks must address.

  POSITION: Care ethics approach to housing justice, apparently arguing for more radical transformative approaches beyond conventional policy frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wabel and De Beer explore housing justice from theological and built environment perspectives, examining how theology should address housing challenges. They investigate four dimensions: how urban planning can enhance affordable sustainable housing; political-economic-legal conditions affecting housing justice; architectural approaches to exclusionary conditions; and dominant social imaginaries shaping housing development. The piece argues for theological engagement with housing justice.

  RELEVANCE: While theological approaches are distinct from the contractualist framework this project develops, the paper's attention to social imaginaries and how different disciplines conceptualize housing justice provides valuable perspective. The emphasis on connecting principles to built environment and planning parallels contractualist concerns about action-guidance. Theological perspectives offer alternative normative foundations useful for comparative analysis.

  POSITION: Theological approach to housing justice emphasizing transdisciplinary engagement and role of social imaginaries in shaping housing development.
