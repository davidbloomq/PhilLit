# Research Proposal: Housing Justice and Urban Planning

## Core Research Question

Under what conditions can the coercive power the state exercises over housing and land be justified, both concerning the current stock of housing and land, and planning decisions which shape the distribution of housing and land in the future?

## Theoretical Framework

This project works within the Rawlsian contractualist tradition (Rawls 1971), asking what principles of housing justice could be agreed to by free and equal citizens deliberating under conditions that neutralize morally arbitrary advantages. However, the inclusion of issues in urban planning requires extending Rawls' framework.

## Central Argument

Standard contractualism assumes we can distribute "primary goods" (like income and liberties) that are valuable to any rational person, regardless of their specific goals. I argue this abstraction fails for the built environment. Urban planning creates specific, obdurate physical structures that facilitate some ways of living while foreclosing others. As Rittel and Webber (1973) established, planning issues are "wicked problems": they inevitably depend on specific, contested value judgments.

This creates a challenge for intergenerational justice (Gosseries 2009; Tremmel 2009). We cannot rely on a "thin theory of the good" to settle planning questions, yet we cannot access the actual preferences of future generations. I argue that to solve this wicked problem, institutions must discharge specific epistemic duties regarding uncertainty and the preservation of option value.

## Context and Motivation

While philosophers have extensively theorized criminal law and taxation, they have paid less attention to state coercion involved in housing policy and urban planning, but see notable exceptions in the Philosophy Compass (2024) article on Just Housing I co-authored with Dan Halliday. Philosophers have explored specific issues including:
- Homelessness (Essert 2016)
- The right to housing (Wells 2019)
- Gentrification (Draper 2022, 2023)

This neglect is notable given that:
1. Housing and urban planning represent some of the most intrusive forms of state power
2. They are a primary determinant of economic distribution (Hsieh and Moretti 2019 estimate that housing supply constraints in high-productivity US cities reduced aggregate growth by 36% between 1964 and 2009)
3. "Tenure neutrality" is violated - subsidies for homeownership exceed 4% of government budgets in some European countries (Kohl 2020)
4. Housing policies undermine equality of opportunity when they contribute to housing shortages in desirable areas

The question is urgent because in German and other European countries, housing has become a primary grievance. In 2024, 13% of German households were overburdened by housing costs, a figure that is even higher for the poorest quintile (Destatis 2024). European housing markets have split into "insiders" (homeowners and long-term tenants) and "outsiders" (younger, poorer, or migrating populations).

## Four Challenges to Standard Contractualism

### Part 1: The Fungibility Problem

**The Challenge:** Dominant theories of distributive justice rely on the Fungibility Assumption - they assume goods can be substituted for another of the same type without loss of value. But housing is non-fungible, because its value is largely determined by its location.

- **Rawls:** Treats housing as part of primary goods, abstracting from location-specific value
- **Dworkin:** Hypothetical auction presupposes substitutability (Dworkin 1981)
- **Capability Approach:** Introduces conversion factors but treats location as a modifier rather than constitutive of value (Sen 1999; Nussbaum 2011)

The issue: One cannot possess the capability to participate in Munich's labor market while residing in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The value of housing in productive cities derives from agglomeration externalities that are not exportable (Duranton & Puga 2004).

**Research Question:** What distributive principles should govern located goods?

### Part 2: Occupancy vs. Access

**The Challenge:** The "occupancy turn" in political philosophy (Stilz 2013; Huber & Wolkenstein 2018) justifies why residents have moral claims to remain - individuals develop life plans embedded in specific locations, so involuntary displacement constitutes a distinctive harm to agency.

But proponents are largely silent on how these claims weigh against claims to access. From a contractualist perspective, there is an unresolved stand-off:
- Principles protecting incumbents cannot be justified to potential newcomers excluded from opportunity
- Principles ignoring attachment cannot be justified to vulnerable long-term residents facing displacement

If occupancy rights imply protection from rising housing costs, they privatize socially created agglomeration value for incumbents (Ganong & Shoag 2017). If they do not, they expose the vulnerable to market eviction.

**Research Question:** What principles for balancing incumbent and newcomer claims could be justified from a contractualist perspective?

### Part 3: Property-Owning Democracy and Housing Wealth

**The Challenge:** Liberal egalitarians have proposed property-owning democracy (POD) as an institutional framework (O'Neill & Williamson 2012). Recent work applies POD to housing, proposing limits on housing wealth (Erck 2024) or land value taxation (Kerr 2019).

But these accounts miss a challenge: when housing assets are the most valuable asset households hold, households evaluate its performance relative to other asset classes. This creates political pressure for policies that support house price growth. The state also aims to keep housing affordable to secure access.

Widespread owner-occupation generates expectations of rising prices, while affordability requires low prices. These aims are in considerable tension. Financialized housing systems try to satisfy both demands through high mortgage subsidies and tax advantages, yet these tie household wealth even more closely to housing price dynamics (Adkins et al. 2020; Ryan-Collins 2021).

POD applied to housing fails the contractualist test: the state cannot justify to newcomers policies that require price appreciation, nor justify to incumbent owners policies that suppress their primary asset's value.

**Research Question:** Can policies that subsidize housing wealth accumulation be justified to all affected parties? What alternative institutional arrangements could meet the contractualist test?

### Part 4: Intergenerational Justice and Epistemic Duties

**The Challenge:** Housing policy and urban planning extend coercion across time - decisions made today lock populations into social and environmental trajectories that bind future generations. Intergenerational justice requires principles no generation could reasonably reject as predecessors or successors.

But we cannot know the preferences of future citizens, yet we must act on assumptions about what they would or would not reject. The epistemic justice literature (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013) has not addressed institutional duties when affected parties cannot voice preferences and decisions are costly to reverse.

Three responses to uncertainty:
1. **Optimizing for predicted preferences** - Fails because predictions are unreliable over planning-relevant timescales
2. **Satisficing across threshold requirements** - Fails because we cannot specify thresholds without knowing future preferences
3. **Option preservation** - What agents would choose under uncertainty about their temporal position

**Research Question:** Which epistemic duties do planning institutions bear to satisfy the contractualist standard? How must they reason under uncertainty?
