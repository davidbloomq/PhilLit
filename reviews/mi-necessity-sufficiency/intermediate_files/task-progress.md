## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [x] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [x] Phase 3: Research domains sequentially (6/6 complete)
- [x] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [x] Phase 5: Write review for each section sequentially (5/5 complete)
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-01 Phase 1: Environment verified, working directory created at reviews/mi-necessity-sufficiency/
2026-01-01 Phase 2: Created lit-review-plan.md (6 domains, 70-100 estimated papers)
2026-01-01 Phase 3: Completed all 6 domain literature searches (105 papers total)
  - Domain 1: literature-domain-1.bib (18 papers - Mechanistic Explanation in Phil Sci)
  - Domain 2: literature-domain-2.bib (18 papers - XAI Taxonomies)
  - Domain 3: literature-domain-3.bib (18 papers - MI Technical Literature)
  - Domain 4: literature-domain-4.bib (18 papers - AI Safety Frameworks)
  - Domain 5: literature-domain-5.bib (18 papers - Necessity/Sufficiency Arguments)
  - Domain 6: literature-domain-6.bib (15 papers - Epistemic Standards)
2026-01-01 Phase 4: Created synthesis-outline.md (4 sections, 8 subsections, 3400-4100 word target)
2026-01-01 Phase 5: Completed all 5 synthesis sections (~4,054 words total)
  - synthesis-section-1-introduction.md (559 words, 6 citations)
  - synthesis-section-2-conceptual-foundations.md (880 words, 14 citations)
  - synthesis-section-3-necessity-sufficiency.md (1,156 words, 22 citations)
  - synthesis-section-4-research-gaps.md (958 words, 12 citations)

## Current Task

Phase 6: Assembling final review and cleaning up intermediate files

## Next Steps

1. Create YAML frontmatter
2. Assemble all sections into literature-review-final.md
3. Aggregate all BibTeX files into literature-all.bib
4. Move intermediate files to intermediate_files/ directory
