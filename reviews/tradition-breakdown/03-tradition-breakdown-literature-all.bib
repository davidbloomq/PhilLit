DOMAIN: Philosophical Theories of Tradition and Its Nature
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 9, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes foundational accounts of what traditions are and
how they function philosophically. The dominant twentieth-century discourse
positions tradition not as static inheritance but as living, dynamic
practice requiring ongoing interpretation. Three major strands emerge:
(1) MacIntyre's practice-based account linking tradition to rationality and
virtue through socially embodied activities; (2) Gadamer's hermeneutic view
positioning tradition as the medium enabling understanding through prejudice
and effective history; (3) Oakeshott's conservative critique of rationalism
defending tradition as practical knowledge irreducible to technical rules.
Earlier theorists like Shils and Polanyi provide sociological and
epistemological grounding for tradition as tacit knowledge and social
continuity. Recent work explores tensions between tradition and critical
reason, tradition's role in identity formation, and whether tradition-based
frameworks can accommodate genuine critique or inherently conserve existing
power structures.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding how traditions function internally—through practices,
rationality, hermeneutic horizons, and tacit knowledge—is essential for
analyzing how they break down. These theories identify the structural
features that enable tradition persistence: rational inquiry within shared
frameworks (MacIntyre), prejudices enabling understanding (Gadamer),
practical knowledge embedded in activity (Oakeshott), and mechanisms of
intergenerational transmission (Shils). Each account implicitly identifies
points of fragility: what happens when practices corrupt, when prejudices
become obstacles, when practical knowledge cannot adapt, or when
transmission mechanisms fail.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While these theories explain tradition maintenance, they provide limited
explicit analysis of tradition breakdown mechanisms. MacIntyre's concept of
"epistemological crisis" offers the most developed account, but systematic
treatment of degeneration, corruption, or dissolution remains underdeveloped
in this literature. The relationship between tradition and modernity
(rationalization, individualism, pluralism) is often implied but rarely
theorized as a breakdown process.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
MacIntyre and Gadamer should be positioned as offering complementary rather
than competing accounts—practices versus hermeneutic understanding represent
different dimensions of tradition. Oakeshott provides crucial conservative
counterpoint emphasizing limits of theoretical articulation. Shils and
Polanyi ground these philosophical accounts in sociological and
epistemological terms. Secondary literature on epistemological crisis,
tradition-constituted rationality, and critique within traditions will be
essential for connecting this domain to breakdown analysis.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Practice-based accounts: 9 papers - Tradition as socially embodied
  practices with internal goods and standards (MacIntyre and followers)
- Hermeneutic accounts: 5 papers - Tradition as prejudice-laden
  interpretive horizon enabling understanding (Gadamer and followers)
- Conservative epistemology: 4 papers - Tradition as practical knowledge
  resistant to rationalist reduction (Oakeshott, Polanyi)

DOMAIN: Internal Mechanisms of Tradition Failure
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how traditions break down from within—through
internal contradictions, ossification, loss of rational
self-reflection, or disconnection between practice and theory.
MacIntyre's concept of epistemological crisis provides the
foundational framework: traditions fail when their conceptual
resources can no longer make sense of new challenges or when
internal incoherence undermines their ability to provide narrative
continuity. The literature reveals three primary failure modes:
(1) epistemological crisis when a tradition's scheme of belief
cannot account for novel situations; (2) ossification when living
practices decay into mere convention or ritual; and (3) loss of
practical wisdom (phronesis) when the capacity for sound judgment
within a tradition degenerates. Gadamer's hermeneutical approach
complements this by analyzing how prejudices can become rigid and
authoritative structures can lose their productive tension with
critical reason.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the core research question about
*how* traditions fail internally. Unlike external pressures
(domain 1), these are endogenous pathologies—traditions defeating
themselves through their own internal dynamics. MacIntyre's work
reveals that rational traditions can suffer epistemological crises
that they either successfully navigate (becoming stronger) or fail
to resolve (fragmenting or ossifying). This establishes criteria
for distinguishing healthy from pathological tradition evolution.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses heavily on epistemological aspects of
tradition failure but gives less attention to the concrete
mechanisms of practical degeneration—the day-to-day processes by
which living practices become dead rituals. There is also limited
empirical analysis of contemporary political traditions undergoing
epistemological crisis. Most examples are historical or religious
rather than political.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework as the
central concept, then branch into specific failure mechanisms:
internal contradiction (Lutz, Herdt), ossification versus healthy
evolution (Angier, Lott), and phronesis decline (MacIntyre on
practices). Use Gadamer to analyze the role of prejudice and
authority in both enabling and constraining tradition rationality.
The synthesis should culminate in criteria for diagnosing tradition
pathology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- MacIntyrean epistemological crisis: 8 papers - Tradition failure
  as narrative/conceptual incoherence requiring reconstruction
- Gadamerian hermeneutics: 3 papers - Prejudice and authority as
  productive yet potentially ossifying
- Practice degeneration: 4 papers - Loss of internal goods and
  corruption of practices
- Rationality debates: 3 papers - Can tradition-based rationality
  avoid relativism and self-contradiction

DOMAIN: External Pressures and Modernization
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how external forces—modernization, rationalism,
secularization, technology, globalization, and colonialism—disrupt or destroy
traditions from outside. The literature reveals three major theoretical
frameworks: (1) Weber's rationalization thesis, arguing that modern
instrumental reason systematically displaces traditional meaning structures
through bureaucratization and disenchantment; (2) Oakeshott's critique of
rationalism in politics, showing how abstract rationalist schemes override
practical, tradition-embedded knowledge; and (3) Scott's analysis of "high
modernism," demonstrating how state simplification projects destroy local
practical knowledge and traditional practices. Recent work extends these
frameworks to analyze secularization (Taylor), globalization and indigenous
displacement (Whyte), and colonialism's destruction of non-Western traditions
(Kelley). The domain shows that external pressures operate through multiple
mechanisms: epistemic (delegitimating traditional knowledge), institutional
(state intervention), technological (disrupting traditional practices),
economic (market rationalization), and cultural (Western universalism).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential analysis of exogenous causes of tradition
breakdown, complementing internal mechanisms. It connects directly to the
project's focus on how traditions fail when subjected to modernizing pressures
that delegitimate their authority, disrupt their transmission mechanisms, or
physically destroy their institutional bases. The rationalism critique is
particularly relevant for understanding how abstract theorizing undermines
practical tradition-based knowledge.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Literature on technology's specific disruption mechanisms remains scattered.
The interaction between multiple external pressures (e.g., how colonialism
and modernization reinforce each other) needs more systematic treatment.
Post-communist tradition reconstruction after external disruption is
under-explored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around distinct disruption mechanisms rather than chronologically.
Contrast rationalist/modernist disruption (Oakeshott, Scott) with more
structural accounts (Weber's rationalization). Note tension between critiques
of modernization and normative defenses of certain modernizing pressures
(e.g., against oppressive traditions).

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Weberian rationalization: 6 papers - Disenchantment through instrumental reason
- Rationalism critique: 4 papers - Abstract planning vs. practical knowledge (Oakeshott, Scott, Hayek)
- Secularization thesis: 4 papers - Religious tradition decline through secular modernity
- Colonialism/imperialism: 4 papers - External destruction of non-Western traditions

DOMAIN: Authority, Legitimacy, and Institutional Decay
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 6, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain investigates how traditions depend on authority structures and
legitimacy, and how the erosion of authority leads to tradition failure. The
literature reveals three interconnected pathways to tradition breakdown:
(1) the crisis of authority itself—the loss of the binding force that made
traditions authoritative; (2) the erosion of institutional legitimacy through
corruption, performance failure, and loss of public trust; and (3) the decay
of institutions that carry and transmit traditions across generations.

Hannah Arendt's foundational analysis of authority identifies it as distinct
from both power and violence, rooted in the Roman triad of tradition,
authority, and religion. Her claim that "the modern age" severed this
connection explains why contemporary attempts to revive tradition often fail:
authority cannot be manufactured once its foundations collapse. Weber's
typology of traditional authority similarly shows how modernization undermines
the conditions for tradition-based legitimacy.

Contemporary empirical work demonstrates the material consequences of this
theoretical analysis. Dalton (2005) and Seligson (2002) show declining trust
in government across advanced democracies, with trust erosion concentrated
among educated elites. Bennett and Livingston (2018) link legitimacy crises
to disinformation and institutional disruption. The crisis is not merely one
of performance failure but of the grounds for authority itself.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the causal mechanisms linking tradition to authority:
traditions require authoritative institutions for transmission and maintenance.
When authority erodes—whether through corruption, performance failure, or
epistemic challenges—traditions lose their binding force. This explains why
traditions cannot simply be "chosen" or rationally reconstructed: they depend
on pre-rational forms of authority that modernity has destabilized.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers explicitly connect authority crisis to tradition breakdown,
treating them as separate phenomena. The literature on institutional decay
focuses on contemporary democracies but rarely engages with Arendt's
foundational analysis. Cross-cultural perspectives on authority and tradition
are underrepresented.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesize Arendt's conceptual framework with empirical findings on trust
erosion and institutional decay. Distinguish three levels: (1) philosophical
analysis of authority's foundations, (2) sociological accounts of legitimacy
crisis, (3) empirical measurement of institutional trust decline. Show how
these levels reinforce a unified account of tradition breakdown through
authority collapse.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Authority Crisis (Arendt): 6 papers - Authority as distinct from power;
  modernity severs the tradition-authority-religion triad
- Trust Erosion (Dalton, Seligson): 4 papers - Declining institutional trust
  as legitimacy crisis across advanced democracies
- Institutional Legitimacy (Buchanan, Greene): 3 papers - Normative and
  descriptive accounts of legitimate authority
- Disinformation & Disruption (Bennett): 2 papers - Contemporary pathways

DOMAIN: Invented Traditions and Inauthenticity
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 7, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The concept of "invented tradition" was brought to prominence by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's seminal 1983 volume, which argued that many traditions claiming ancient origins are in fact recent constructions designed to establish social cohesion, legitimize institutions, or inculcate values. This framework has generated extensive scholarly debate about the distinction between "authentic" organic traditions and "invented" fabricated ones, particularly regarding their vulnerability to breakdown.

The literature reveals three main debates: First, whether the organic/invented distinction can be meaningfully maintained, as all traditions involve some degree of selective construction and reconstruction (Alexander 2016; Taruskin 2020). Second, whether invented traditions are inherently less stable than organic ones, with some scholars suggesting fabricated traditions lack the embedded social practices necessary for resilience (Ranger 2012; Kelley 2012), while others point to the durability of nationalist myths (Abizadeh 2014). Third, how ideology and political manipulation corrupt traditions through instrumentalization for nationalist, religious, or state purposes (McCarty 2017; Bogumiล‚ & ลukaszewicz 2018).

The domain encompasses case studies ranging from British royal pageantry and colonial African traditions to Buddhist tree ordinations and Turkmen personality cults. A consistent finding is that invented traditions often serve to consolidate power rather than preserve authentic cultural memory, making them particularly vulnerable to exposure and loss of legitimacy when their constructed nature becomes apparent.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Understanding invented traditions is crucial for analyzing tradition breakdown because it reveals how the fabrication or ideological distortion of traditions creates inherent instability. When traditions are instrumentalized for political purposes or revealed to lack genuine historical roots, they lose the embedded social legitimacy that sustains organic traditions. This domain directly addresses the project's questions about what makes traditions vulnerable to breakdown and what distinguishes authentic tradition maintenance from mere ideological manipulation.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses heavily on nationalist and colonial contexts, with less attention to how invented religious traditions break down. Additionally, there's limited philosophical analysis of the normative distinction between acceptable "reconstruction" of tradition (Eisenstadt) versus problematic "invention"—a gap that affects how we evaluate the ethics of tradition manipulation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain with others, pay particular attention to how Hobsbawm's concept intersects with theories of tradition degeneration (Domain 3) and nationalist manipulation (Domain 4). The tension between "all traditions are somewhat invented" and "some traditions are more fabricated than others" should be explored philosophically, not just empirically.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Hobsbawmian critique: Invented traditions are ideologically constructed pseudo-traditions (7 papers)
- Continuist position: All traditions involve reconstruction and selection (4 papers)
- Nationalist instrumentalization: Traditions manipulated for political identity construction (5 papers)
- Legitimacy crisis: Invented traditions vulnerable to breakdown when exposed (2 papers)

DOMAIN: Conservative and Communitarian Perspectives on Tradition Loss
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses theoretical accounts from conservative and communitarian
thinkers who diagnose tradition breakdown as a central problem of modernity.
Conservative thinkers from Burke through Scruton emphasize the organic, inherited
nature of traditions and diagnose their erosion through rationalist reform,
revolutionary disruption, and liberal abstraction. Communitarian critics like
MacIntyre, Sandel, and Taylor focus on how liberal individualism and procedural
neutrality undermine the constitutive communities and shared narratives necessary
for tradition maintenance. MacIntyre's influential After Virtue traces moral
fragmentation to the Enlightenment project's abandonment of Aristotelian teleology
and tradition-constituted rationality. These thinkers offer rich phenomenological
accounts of how traditions fail: through forgetting of origins, severance from
practice, loss of authoritative narratives, and the displacement of substantive
goods by procedural frameworks.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for understanding normative diagnoses of tradition
breakdown. Unlike descriptive sociological accounts, these thinkers take tradition
seriously as a philosophical category and offer sustained arguments about what is
lost when traditions fail. Their work identifies specific mechanisms: Burke's
critique of rationalist reform destroying accumulated wisdom; MacIntyre's account
of how liberal individualism severs the narrative unity necessary for virtue;
Taylor's analysis of authenticity's devolution into shallow self-fulfillment;
communitarian critiques of neutrality as itself a tradition-eroding stance.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most of this literature focuses on Western liberal modernity. Less attention to
non-Western conservative traditions or to internal conservative debates about which
traditions deserve preservation. Limited engagement with empirical questions about
actual mechanisms of breakdown vs. philosophical claims about what ought to be
preserved.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish between: (1) Burkean conservative emphasis on organic growth vs.
revolutionary rupture; (2) MacIntyrean focus on narrative unity and practice;
(3) communitarian emphasis on constitutive communities vs. liberal atomism;
(4) Taylor's phenomenology of authenticity and moral sources. Note tensions
between universalist natural law conservatives and particularist tradition-
dependent conservatives. Consider how these diagnoses might apply beyond the
liberal-communitarian debate.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Burkean conservatism (5 papers): Organic tradition vs. rationalist reform
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics (6 papers): Tradition-constituted rationality vs. liberal individualism
- Communitarian critique (4 papers): Constitutive communities vs. liberal neutrality
- Conservative cultural criticism (3 papers): Cultural decay and loss of shared standards

DOMAIN: Empirical and Historical Case Studies of Tradition Breakdown
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines concrete historical and empirical cases of tradition
breakdown across political and cultural contexts. The literature reveals
several critical patterns: (1) revolutionary moments as sites of tradition
rupture (French, Russian, Iranian revolutions); (2) democratic collapse and
institutional failure (Weimar Republic, contemporary Turkey); (3) totalitarian
destruction of tradition (Nazi Germany, Stalinism); and (4) structural
transformations that erode traditional frameworks (post-communist transitions).

Key scholarly contributions come from Hannah Arendt's analysis of revolution
and totalitarianism as tradition-destroying phenomena, Theda Skocpol's
comparative historical sociology of revolutions, and contemporary case studies
of democratic backsliding. The literature demonstrates that tradition breakdown
is rarely a simple linear process but involves complex interactions between
institutional weakness, social mobilization, ideological transformation, and
crisis conditions.

Recent scholarship (2015-2025) extends this analysis to contemporary cases of
democratic erosion, revealing how polarization, elite defection from democratic
norms, and the politicization of deep cultural divides can accelerate tradition
collapse. The empirical literature provides crucial evidence for testing
theoretical claims about mechanisms of tradition failure.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the empirical foundation for understanding how traditions
actually break down in practice. The case studies offer concrete evidence of
mechanisms, sequences, and contingencies involved in tradition failure that
theoretical frameworks must account for. Historical cases like Weimar, the
French Revolution, and contemporary democratic backsliding provide test cases
for evaluating theories of tradition breakdown and for identifying warning
signs of tradition failure.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature provides rich case studies of dramatic tradition collapse
(revolutions, democratic breakdown), there is less systematic analysis of
slower, incremental processes of tradition erosion. Few studies explicitly
connect case study evidence to general theories of tradition breakdown or
systematically compare successful tradition adaptation with tradition failure.
The connection between cultural/intellectual tradition breakdown and political/
institutional collapse deserves more systematic treatment.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should organize case studies by type of breakdown
(revolutionary, institutional collapse, totalitarian destruction, gradual
erosion) and identify common causal mechanisms across cases. Special attention
should be paid to Arendt's conceptual framework for understanding tradition
breakdown through revolution and totalitarianism, as this provides a bridge
between empirical cases and theoretical analysis. The contrast between Weimar
and post-WWII German democracy offers particularly valuable insights into
conditions for tradition resilience versus failure.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Structural explanations (Skocpol): 8 papers - Tradition breakdown driven by
  state crisis, class structure, and international pressures
- Political process approaches: 6 papers - Role of elite choices, polarization,
  and institutional design in tradition collapse
- Cultural/ideological approaches (Arendt): 4 papers - Tradition breakdown as
  rupture in meaning, loss of authority, and ideological transformation

  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  edition = {1st},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The Enlightenment project of justifying morality through
  universal reason failed because it severed moral concepts from their
  grounding in social practices and traditions. MacIntyre argues that
  virtues can only be understood within the context of practices (coherent
  social activities with internal goods), narrative unity of individual
  lives, and living moral traditions that extend practices historically.
  Modernity's fragmentation of moral discourse into incommensurable
  positions (emotivism) results from abandoning tradition-based frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the practice-tradition-virtue
  nexus central to contemporary philosophical accounts of tradition. The
  concept of practice—with its internal goods and standards of
  excellence—provides a structural account of how traditions maintain
  coherence and transmit normative content. Critically, MacIntyre's
  diagnosis of modernity as fragmentation of traditions establishes the
  conceptual space for analyzing tradition breakdown, though he focuses more
  on recovery than on mechanisms of degeneration.

  doi = {10.2307/2074148},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rationality itself is tradition-constituted; there is no
  neutral, tradition-independent standpoint from which to adjudicate between
  rival conceptions of justice and practical rationality. Each tradition
  (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal) embodies
  distinct conceptions of goods, virtues, and rational inquiry. Traditions
  progress through engaging internal incoherences and "epistemological
  crises" when their conceptual resources fail to account for experience.
  Genuine rational comparison between traditions is possible when one
  tradition can explain the limitations of its rival better than that rival
  can explain itself.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how traditions structure
  rationality and how they can fail. The concept of "epistemological crisis"
  provides the most developed philosophical account of tradition breakdown:
  the moment when a tradition's conceptual resources prove inadequate to
  make sense of experience or solve problems it previously could address.
  MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality directly informs
  analysis of why tradition breakdown is not mere external destruction but
  internal rational failure—the tradition's inability to sustain its own
  standards of inquiry.

  POSITION: Historically-informed epistemology; tradition-constituted

  address = {T{\"u}bingen},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Understanding is always mediated by tradition through
  "prejudices" (pre-judgments) and "effective history" that shape
  interpretive horizons. Against Enlightenment rationalism's "prejudice
  against prejudice," Gadamer rehabilitates prejudice as the enabling
  condition of understanding rather than obstacle to it. Tradition is not
  an object to be grasped by detached reason but the medium within which
  understanding occurs. The hermeneutic circle—understanding parts through
  wholes and wholes through parts—characterizes all interpretation,
  including self-understanding within traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for hermeneutic accounts of tradition emphasizing
  how traditions constitute interpretive frameworks rather than mere content
  to be transmitted. Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice and authority
  provides philosophical legitimation for tradition's enabling role in
  rationality—complementing MacIntyre's practice-based account by focusing
  on hermeneutic understanding. Critically, Gadamer's framework raises
  questions about tradition breakdown: if traditions are constitutive of
  understanding, how can they be critically assessed? When do
  tradition-enabling prejudices become tradition-disabling blindness?

  publisher = {Methuen},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.2307/2955514},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: "Rationalism in politics" represents a dangerous
  misconception that political wisdom can be reduced to explicit principles
  (technical knowledge) and applied universally. Genuine political knowledge
  is primarily "practical knowledge"—traditional, contextual understanding
  embedded in customs, habits, and concrete activities that cannot be fully
  articulated or codified. Rationalists mistakenly believe that eliminating
  tradition and rebuilding institutions from abstract principles will
  improve politics, but they destroy irreplaceable practical knowledge
  accumulated through generations of adaptation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conservative epistemological defense of tradition
  emphasizing the limits of explicit rationality and the indispensability of
  tacit, practice-embedded knowledge. Oakeshott's critique of rationalism
  identifies a key mechanism of tradition breakdown: attempts to replace
  practical knowledge with technical knowledge destroy the very forms of
  understanding traditions preserve. His distinction between technical and
  practical knowledge parallels Polanyi's tacit knowledge, offering
  resources for analyzing how modernizing rationalization dissolves
  traditional competencies that cannot be explicitly transmitted or
  institutionally codified.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive study systematically analyzes MacIntyre's
  intellectual development across ethics, social theory, Marxism, and
  philosophy of religion. D'Andrea explicates the conceptual architecture
  connecting practices, narrative, and tradition in MacIntyre's virtue

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke defends Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics against
  charges of conservatism and relativism by showing how tradition enables
  rather than constrains critical reason. While Gadamer emphasizes
  tradition's constitutive role in understanding, this does not preclude
  rational critique—rather, critique operates within hermeneutic horizons
  shaped by tradition. The "fusion of horizons" through dialogue allows for
  transformation of prejudices without requiring impossible escape from
  tradition entirely. Tradition is neither static authority nor arbitrary
  starting point but living medium of ongoing interpretive engagement.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses central tension in tradition theory: how can
  tradition-constituted understanding accommodate critique of tradition
  itself? Warnke's defense of Gadamer against conservatism charges directly
  engages the question of whether traditions inherently resist transformation
  or can incorporate self-critical reflection. This bears on tradition
  breakdown: are failing traditions those that lose capacity for
  self-criticism, or those that abandon traditional grounding entirely? The
  fusion of horizons concept suggests traditions break down when dialogue
  and interpretive transformation cease.

  volume = {88},
  pages = {619--640},
  doi = {10.5840/acpq201492234},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz argues that MacIntyre's account reveals traditions to
  be fundamentally fragile, not robust, because they depend on active
  practice-engagement and rational inquiry rather than passive transmission
  of content. Traditions survive only through continuous re-appropriation by
  practitioners who must both master inherited standards and extend inquiry
  into new problems. The practice-dependence of traditions means they can
  degenerate when practices corrupt, when standards of excellence erode, or
  when communities fail to sustain the social conditions enabling
  practice-participation.

  RELEVANCE: Explicitly thematizes tradition fragility within MacIntyre's
  framework, making it particularly relevant to breakdown analysis. Lutz
  identifies structural vulnerabilities: traditions require not just
  historical continuity but active rational inquiry, which can fail. This
  connects directly to the research question by identifying mechanisms of
  breakdown: corruption of practices, erosion of standards, loss of
  community structures supporting practice-participation. Lutz's emphasis on
  fragility corrects triumphalist readings of MacIntyre that emphasize only
  tradition resilience.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kuna examines whether MacIntyre's tradition-constituted
  rationality escapes relativism or merely obscures it. While MacIntyre
  argues that rational comparison between traditions is possible when one
  tradition can explain another's limitations better than that tradition can
  explain itself, Kuna questions whether this criterion is sufficiently
  robust. The problem of incommensurability between traditions may be deeper
  than MacIntyre acknowledges: if rationality standards themselves are
  tradition-internal, cross-tradition rational adjudication faces persistent
  circularities.

  RELEVANCE: Engages the theoretical adequacy of MacIntyre's framework for
  understanding tradition comparison and potential breakdown. If relativism
  is inescapable, then "tradition breakdown" may be indistinguishable from
  "tradition transformation" or "tradition replacement"—there would be no
  rational standpoint from which to judge one outcome superior. Conversely,
  if MacIntyre succeeds in showing genuine cross-tradition rational
  comparison, this provides resources for analyzing when traditions fail by
  their own standards versus when they are displaced by rationally superior
  alternatives.

  POSITION: Critical assessment of MacIntyre questioning whether
  tradition-constituted rationality successfully avoids relativism.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mili{\'c} explicates Gadamer's controversial rehabilitation
  of prejudice, authority, and tradition as legitimate sources of
  understanding rather than obstacles to truth. Gadamer's critique of
  Enlightenment rationalism shows that the "prejudice against prejudice"
  itself reflects historical bias. Pre-judgments (Vorurteile) shaped by
  tradition are not arbitrary but carry accumulated wisdom tested through
  effective history. Authority is not blind submission but recognition of
  superior judgment. Tradition is not dead weight but living transmission
  enabling understanding.

  RELEVANCE: Recent restatement of Gadamer's core hermeneutic theses,
  valuable for understanding how traditions function as enabling rather than
  constraining frameworks. The rehabilitation of prejudice and authority
  connects to breakdown analysis: when do legitimate authority and
  tradition-grounded prejudice become illegitimate domination and distorting
  bias? Gadamer's framework suggests breakdown occurs not through abandoning
  tradition but through failure of hermeneutic engagement—when prejudices
  ossify into dogmas resistant to dialogical transformation through
  encounter with different horizons.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exposition of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy with
  attention to its implications for understanding tradition's role in

  year = {2016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander compares three distinct twentieth-century
  philosophical accounts of tradition: Arendt's narrative of lost tradition
  (the thread connecting past and present has broken), Oakeshott's defense
  of tradition as practical knowledge irreducible to rationalist
  reconstruction, and MacIntyre's practice-based account of living
  traditions requiring rational inquiry. While Arendt mourns tradition's
  collapse, Oakeshott defends what remains, and MacIntyre seeks recovery
  through renewed engagement with tradition-constituted rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the research question by comparing how three
  major thinkers conceptualize tradition and its potential breakdown.
  Arendt's account of tradition's rupture in modernity provides explicit
  breakdown narrative, while Oakeshott emphasizes erosion through rationalist
  assault, and MacIntyre offers framework for distinguishing genuine
  tradition from degenerate simulacra. The comparison reveals different
  dimensions of breakdown: catastrophic rupture (Arendt), gradual erosion
  (Oakeshott), internal corruption versus rational transformation
  (MacIntyre).

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Franco challenges common interpretations of Oakeshott as
  straightforward conservative by showing how his political philosophy,
  especially his concept of "civil association," aligns with liberal values
  of individual freedom and rule of law. Oakeshott's critique of
  "rationalism in politics" targets not reason per se but the ideological
  subordination of politics to single substantive purposes. His defense of
  tradition is not reactionary nostalgia but recognition that political
  freedom requires practices and understandings that cannot be manufactured
  through abstract design.

  RELEVANCE: Complicates the understanding of Oakeshott's relationship to
  tradition by showing his defense is compatible with, indeed requires,
  individual liberty and limited government. This suggests that tradition
  breakdown, from Oakeshott's perspective, occurs not simply through change
  or reform but specifically through rationalist attempts to replace
  inherited political understandings with ideologically-driven projects.
  Franco's interpretation helps distinguish Oakeshott's position from crude
  conservatism that simply resists change.

  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shils provides sociological account of tradition as
  patterns of belief and practice transmitted across generations through
  mechanisms of authority, charisma, and institutional routines. Traditions
  are not static entities but living processes requiring active reproduction
  by each generation. All societies require traditions to function; even
  revolutionary movements create new traditions while claiming to break with
  the past. The tension between tradition and modernity is not simple
  opposition but complex negotiation in which modern institutions themselves
  become traditiona lized.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational sociological analysis providing empirical grounding
  for philosophical accounts of tradition. Shils identifies social mechanisms
  of tradition maintenance and transmission: authority structures,
  institutional carriers, educational systems, ritual practices. This
  sociological perspective directly informs breakdown analysis by identifying
  concrete structures whose erosion or transformation disrupts traditional
  continuity. Shils's emphasis on tradition's necessity for social order
  suggests breakdown has wide-ranging consequences beyond loss of particular
  content.

  year = {1958},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: All knowledge, including scientific knowledge, rests on a
  foundation of "tacit knowledge"—skills, judgments, and understandings that
  cannot be fully articulated or transmitted through explicit rules. This
  tacit dimension is learned through apprenticeship within traditions of
  practice, not through formal instruction alone. The ideal of perfectly
  explicit, impersonal knowledge is impossible; all knowing requires personal
  judgment grounded in inherited frameworks. Tradition is not obstacle to
  genuine knowledge but its necessary condition.

  RELEVANCE: Provides epistemological foundation for practice-based and
  conservative accounts of tradition by demonstrating the ineliminability of
  tacit knowledge. Polanyi's framework directly supports Oakeshott's
  distinction between technical and practical knowledge while complementing
  MacIntyre's emphasis on practice-embedded standards. For breakdown
  analysis, Polanyi's account suggests traditions fail when mechanisms
  transmitting tacit knowledge are disrupted—when apprenticeship relations
  dissolve, when explicit codification replaces embodied competence, or when
  communities of practice fragment.

  pages = {25--37},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Atkinson defends Gadamer against critics (Warnke, Caputo)
  who argue his emphasis on tradition makes his hermeneutics inherently
  conservative and incapable of genuine critique. She argues that Gadamer's
  rehabilitation of prejudice and tradition does not entail uncritical
  acceptance of authority but rather recognizes that all understanding,
  including critical understanding, operates within historically-effected
  consciousness. The fusion of horizons enables transformation of prejudices,
  not their preservation. Tradition is living dialogue, not static
  authority.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages the question of whether tradition-based
  frameworks can accommodate critique or inherently conserve existing
  arrangements. This is essential for breakdown analysis: if Gadamer's
  critics are right, traditions cannot self-critically recognize their own
  failures and breakdown becomes explicable only through external critique
  or revolutionary rupture. If Atkinson is right, traditions can recognize
  internal inadequacies, suggesting breakdown may result from failure of
  hermeneutic engagement rather than impossibility of tradition-internal
  critique.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lott examines potential self-referential problems in
  MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality. If rationality
  is always tradition-based, does MacIntyre's own philosophical analysis
  depend on some particular tradition's standards? If so, how can it claim
  universal validity? Lott argues MacIntyre can avoid this problem by
  showing how his analysis emerges from within a specific philosophical
  tradition (Thomistic Aristotelianism) while nonetheless providing resources
  for cross-tradition rational comparison through the concept of
  epistemological crisis.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses methodological adequacy of tradition-based approaches
  to analyzing traditions. For breakdown analysis, this raises the question:
  from what standpoint can tradition breakdown be recognized and diagnosed?
  If the analyst must stand within some tradition, can objective assessment
  of tradition failure occur? Lott's resolution through epistemological
  crisis concept suggests breakdown can be recognized from within when
  traditions fail by their own standards—providing grounds for immanent

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cloutier explicates MacIntyre's late concept of
  "sociological self-knowledge" as essential for adjudicating moral
  disagreements within and between traditions. Understanding one's social
  location and the structural conditions shaping practices is necessary for
  recognizing when apparent disagreements reflect genuine moral differences
  versus different social contexts. Critical realist sociology can provide
  the kind of structural analysis MacIntyre's virtue ethics requires for
  practical application.

  RELEVANCE: Extends MacIntyre's framework by emphasizing social-structural
  analysis as necessary for understanding tradition function and dysfunction.
  For breakdown analysis, this suggests traditions fail not only through
  internal conceptual inadequacies but also through social-structural
  conditions that undermine practices: economic arrangements that corrupt
  internal goods, institutional forms that prevent practice-participation,
  or power relations that distort tradition-constituted inquiry. Connects
  philosophical tradition theory to sociological analysis of structural

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bishop applies MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted
  rationality to bioethics debates over female circumcision, arguing that
  modern liberalism's inability to coherently condemn the practice without
  imposing its own tradition-specific values reveals liberalism's own
  tradition-dependence despite its universalist pretensions. Genuine
  cross-cultural moral dialogue requires acknowledging that all positions,
  including liberal ones, emerge from particular traditions with
  historically-specific rationality standards.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates application of MacIntyre's framework to concrete
  ethical controversies, showing how tradition-constituted rationality plays
  out in practice. For breakdown analysis, Bishop's case study reveals how
  traditions encounter limits: when internal conceptual resources cannot
  address new challenges (biomedical technologies, cross-cultural encounter)
  without either betraying core commitments or becoming unintelligible to
  others. Such encounters may precipitate epistemological crises requiring

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Flaga critically examines MacIntyre's anti-individualist
  account of how tradition and community constitute individual identity and
  agency. While MacIntyre effectively shows that modern individualism's
  autonomous self is incoherent, Flaga questions whether MacIntyre's
  alternative—the self embedded in practices, narratives, and traditions—
  leaves sufficient room for individual freedom and critical distance from
  community norms. The tradition-constituted self may be as philosophically
  problematic as the liberal autonomous self, merely from opposite direction.

  RELEVANCE: Recent critical engagement with MacIntyre raising concerns
  about individual agency within tradition-based frameworks. For breakdown
  analysis, this highlights potential internal tensions: traditions require
  individual appropriation and inquiry, but if tradition too completely
  constitutes the self, how can individuals recognize tradition's failures
  or initiate needed reforms? Flaga's critique suggests traditions may break
  down when they suppress individual agency required for tradition-sustaining
  inquiry, creating paradox where tradition-maintenance requires
  anti-traditional individuality.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defines epistemological crisis as occurring when an agent's conceptual scheme fails to make intelligible what they encounter, requiring narrative reconstruction to resolve. Crisis resolution involves creating a new narrative that explains both the old inadequate scheme and why it failed—making the crisis itself intelligible. In traditions of inquiry, crises arise when established methods cannot account for accumulating anomalies, demanding fundamental reconceptualization.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the concept central to understanding tradition breakdown. MacIntyre shows that traditions don't simply "stagnate"—they face specific crises of intelligibility when their conceptual resources prove inadequate. This provides precise analytical tools for identifying when a tradition is failing versus when it is undergoing productive transformation. The paper distinguishes genuine crisis (requiring fundamental reconceptualization) from routine problem-solving, crucial for the research project's investigation of breakdown mechanisms.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents three rival conceptions of moral inquiry in conflict: the Encyclopaedia tradition (claiming universal rational foundations), Genealogy (Nietzschean deconstruction revealing power behind truth-claims), and Tradition (particularist rationality embedded in practices). Argues that only tradition-based inquiry can coherently account for its own standards while remaining open to rational revision. Internal contradictions doom both Encyclopaedia (cannot ground its universalism) and Genealogy (self-undermining skepticism).

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how traditions of inquiry succeed or fail based on their ability to handle internal contradictions and epistemological crises. The Encyclopaedia tradition's collapse illustrates how failure to acknowledge one's own tradition-embeddedness leads to incoherence. This provides conceptual resources for analyzing when political traditions become internally contradictory—particularly traditions claiming universal foundations while operating within particular frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive analysis of MacIntyre's theory of tradition-constituted rationality, defending it against charges of relativism while examining potential internal tensions.

Explores whether tradition-based rationality can coherently ground universal moral claims.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the question of when tradition-based rationality becomes internally incoherent. Lutz identifies the potential self-contradiction: if all rationality is tradition-dependent, how can one tradition claim superiority? This maps onto the research question about internal tradition failure—traditions may collapse under the weight of their own epistemological commitments.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically examines whether MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality can escape charges of self-reference and provide genuine justification. Argues that MacIntyre's claim that traditions can rationally defeat rivals requires covert appeal to tradition-transcendent standards, creating internal inconsistency. If all rationality is tradition-bound, the criteria for judging one tradition superior to another must themselves be tradition-relative, undermining claims of rational superiority.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies a potential fatal internal contradiction in tradition-based rationality: the self-reference problem. This is directly relevant to understanding how traditions fail from within—if a tradition's epistemological commitments are self-undermining, it faces inevitable crisis. Herdt's analysis reveals that traditions claiming both radical particularity and rational superiority may be internally incoherent, a key mechanism of breakdown.

Angier identifies ossification as occurring when a tradition loses capacity for genuine argument about its own goods and purposes, instead enforcing conformity to inherited patterns. This provides criteria for diagnosing when political traditions have degenerated from living arguments into dead conventions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies MacIntyre's intelligibility crisis concept to Yugoslav national narrative, analyzing how people lost ability to make sense of their actions when moving from pre-Yugoslav to Yugoslav to post-Yugoslav contexts. Intelligibility crisis occurs when individuals cannot connect themselves with new social context, losing the narrative continuity that makes actions meaningful. Shows how tradition breakdown creates existential disorientation.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates real-world political consequences when tradition's narrative framework collapses—people unable to make their own lives intelligible. This connects tradition failure to practical breakdown: when political traditions lose narrative coherence, they cease providing the conceptual resources citizens need to understand their roles and purposes.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the tension between tradition as enabling and tradition as constraining—directly relevant to understanding tradition pathology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces MacIntyre's intellectual journey from Marxism through epistemological crisis to Aristotelianism, analyzing how his own experience exemplifies tradition-constituted rationality and crisis resolution. MacIntyre's abandonment of Marxism resulted from recognizing its inability to provide coherent account of individual and common good or to resolve tensions between theory and practice. His turn to Aristotelian tradition resolved these crises by providing richer conceptual resources.

  RELEVANCE: Provides autobiographical case study of epistemological crisis and tradition transition. MacIntyre's own intellectual development illustrates the dynamics of tradition failure and reconstruction he theorizes. His experience shows how a tradition (Marxism) can fail to provide adequate account of fundamental questions (human telos, common good), precipitating crisis that requires moving to a different tradition with superior resources.

  doi = {10.5040/9780567672803.ch-007},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor argues that Western modernity is defined not by the
  disappearance of religion but by a shift in the "conditions of belief"—from
  a world where belief in God was unproblematic to one where both belief and
  unbelief are contested options within an "immanent frame." Secularization is
  understood as disenchantment (loss of transcendent meaning embedded in the
  world) and the "disembedding" of individuals from traditional religious and
  social frameworks. Taylor traces this transformation through the Reformation,
  Enlightenment, and Romantic periods, showing how the disciplinary project of
  reform inadvertently created conditions for exclusive humanism and radical
  secularity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how modernization pressures—particularly
  secularization and rationalization—create conditions where tradition loses its
  taken-for-granted status. Taylor's analysis of "disembedding" directly addresses
  how individuals are extracted from traditional contexts of meaning. His concept
  of the immanent frame illuminates how modern thought structures make
  transcendent sources of authority (including traditions) contestable. The work
  shows that external pressure need not destroy tradition overtly but can
  transform the epistemic conditions under which tradition must justify itself.

  POSITION: Weberian disenchantment framework, but emphasizes cultural-spiritual
  transformation rather than institutional rationalization. Critical of both
  subtraction narratives (secularization as simple loss of religion) and pure
  nostalgia for pre-modern enchantment.

  publisher = {Yale University Press},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvxkn7ds},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scott argues that large-scale authoritarian state planning
  projects systematically fail because they impose simplified, legible schemas
  that override local practical knowledge ("metis"). High-modernist ideology—the
  belief that scientific-technical knowledge can reshape society for the
  better—combined with authoritarian state power produces disasters when it
  ignores the complex, context-dependent knowledge embedded in local practices
  and traditions. Scott analyzes Soviet collectivization, Tanzanian villagization,
  and scientific forestry as cases where state simplification destroyed
  functioning traditional systems. The book identifies four conditions for such
  disasters: administrative ordering, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian
  power, and a prostrate civil society unable to resist.

  RELEVANCE: Provides detailed analysis of how state-driven modernization
  projects destroy traditions by delegitimating and replacing local practical
  knowledge with centralized rational planning. Directly relevant to understanding
  tradition breakdown through external imposition of abstract rationalist schemes.
  Scott's concept of metis captures what Oakeshott calls "practical knowledge"—the
  kind of knowledge traditions embody and transmit. Shows mechanism by which
  modernization physically destroys traditional practices while claiming to improve
  human welfare.

  POSITION: Anarchist-influenced critique of state rationalism; sympathetic to
  local, traditional knowledge against centralizing modernization. Aligns with
  Oakeshott's rationalism critique but provides concrete historical cases.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Conrad challenges Eurocentric narratives that treat the
  Enlightenment as a uniquely European phenomenon that then "spread" to the
  rest of the world through modernization. He argues that Enlightenment ideas
  emerged through global interactions and colonial encounters, not autonomous
  European development. The Weberian narrative of Western rationalization and
  disenchantment as distinctive to Europe misrepresents historical reality and
  serves to legitimate Western cultural imperialism. Conrad proposes replacing
  diffusion narratives with accounts of mutual constitution and entanglement.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how modernization narratives themselves
  function as instruments of tradition destruction in non-Western contexts.
  Challenges the assumption that rationalization and disenchantment are
  universally valid frameworks rather than parochial Western categories imposed
  globally. Illuminates how intellectual history of modernization theory reflects
  and reinforces colonial power relations that destroyed non-Western traditions

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Whyte et al. argue that indigenous peoples have ancient
  traditions of environmental mobility, migration, and resettlement based on
  fluid, transformative relationships. Colonialism operates as a containment
  strategy that curtails indigenous mobility, disrupting these traditions by
  fixing populations in place and destroying adaptive capacity. The contemporary
  climate crisis and discussions of climate-induced resettlement must be
  understood in the context of ongoing colonial containment, not as genuinely
  "new" challenges. The authors analyze Gulf Coast and Alaskan cases to show
  how colonial restrictions on mobility compound climate vulnerability.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates concrete mechanism by which colonialism destroys
  traditions—not just through ideological delegitimation but through physical
  containment and prevention of traditional practices. Illuminates how external
  pressures (colonialism, state policy) can destroy traditions by making their
  exercise impossible, even when the knowledge is retained. Connects to broader
  theme of how modernization projects disrupt traditional adaptive strategies,
  leaving communities vulnerable to environmental change.

  POSITION: Indigenous environmental philosophy; explicitly anti-colonial.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Liu examines whether Weber's proposed solution to modernity's
  disenchantment—democratic charisma generated through elections—can genuinely
  heal the spiritual deficit created by rationalization. Drawing on critiques
  by Storm (enchantment never fully vanished) and Marotta (demagification vs.
  disenchantment), Liu argues that democratic charisma remains structurally
  frail because it is embedded in the same legal-rational procedures that
  produce disenchantment. Electoral spectacles and populist appeals offer only
  transient simulations of meaning that are easily routinized or manipulated.

  RELEVANCE: Recent analysis (2025) of Weber's rationalization thesis and its
  implications for tradition and meaning in modernity. Relevant for understanding
  limits of procedural solutions to tradition breakdown—shows how formal
  democratic procedures cannot restore the embedded meaning that traditional
  structures provided. Illuminates tension between efficient governance (requiring
  rationalization) and authentic collective belief (requiring tradition or
  charisma).

  response to disenchantment. Emphasizes structural contradictions in modern

  doi = {10.2307/2072870},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor provides a genealogy of modern identity, tracing how
  contemporary notions of selfhood, inwardness, and authenticity emerged through
  transformations in moral frameworks from Plato through Romanticism. He argues
  that modern identity is shaped by three major cultural shifts: internalization
  of moral sources, affirmation of ordinary life, and expressivist turn toward
  authenticity. These shifts create distinctively modern moral horizons but also
  generate characteristic pathologies including instrumental reason's dominance
  and loss of transcendent frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational work on how modernization transforms the self's
  relationship to tradition and moral authority. Shows how shift from external
  traditional sources to internal authenticity undermines traditions' authority
  by relocating moral sources within the individual. The internalization Taylor
  describes creates structural conditions where tradition appears as external
  imposition rather than constitutive framework. Links directly to tradition
  breakdown through transformation of moral epistemology.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ali argues that Islamic revivalism responds to modernity's
  crisis—secularism's failure to deliver promised perfect global order—not to
  modernity itself. Revivalist movements seek to steer modernity out of crisis
  through Islamization: introducing Islamic rituals, practices, and institutions
  into modern life to transform modernity from dar al-harb (abode of war) to
  dar al-Islam (abode of peace). Contemporary Islamic revivalism is not
  anti-modern but religiously based reaction against secularism's negative
  consequences and systematic violence inherent in secular modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Shows complex relationship between tradition and modernity—not
  simple rejection but attempted synthesis. Relevant for understanding how
  tradition breakdown through secularization can generate revivalist responses
  that seek to reconstruct tradition within modernity rather than restore
  pre-modern forms. Challenges simplistic secularization narratives where
  tradition inevitably declines. Illuminates how external modernizing pressures

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: King analyzes Scott's Seeing Like a State as grounded political
  theory that rediscovers skeptical themes from counter-enlightenment, anarchist,
  libertarian, and postcolonial thought through rich empirical evidence. While
  Scott's core thesis—that state simplification schemes destroy local practical
  knowledge—resonates with long-standing critiques of coercive power and rational
  planning, his work's value lies in demonstrating these abstract arguments
  through concrete historical cases. King defends Scott as political theory
  against charges of merely restating familiar skepticism, emphasizing
  methodological and substantive lessons for political theory.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical analysis of Scott's contribution to
  understanding state-driven tradition destruction. Explicitly connects Scott's
  work to broader tradition of rationalism critique (Burke, Oakeshott, Hayek),
  positioning his analysis within political philosophy's skeptical tradition.
  Useful for synthesis work connecting different strands of anti-rationalist
  thought and showing how they illuminate tradition breakdown mechanisms.

  doi = {10.1353/aq.2017.0020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelley challenges Patrick Wolfe's settler colonial studies
  framework for inadequately addressing African colonization and racial capitalism.
  He argues that Wolfe's distinction—indigenous people are colonized for land
  (logic of elimination), Africans for labor (not primarily land-based
  colonization)—erases African indigeneity and obscures how settler colonialism
  operated globally. Drawing on Cedric Robinson's Black Radical Tradition, Kelley
  shows how racial regimes are historically contingent and how capitalism itself
  is racially structured. By not incorporating African and European history more
  fully, settler colonial theory delimits more than it reveals.

  RELEVANCE: Critiques and extends settler colonial studies, relevant for
  understanding how colonialism destroyed non-European traditions through
  multiple mechanisms (elimination, enslavement, cultural destruction). Shows
  that tradition destruction through external imperial force takes different
  forms depending on colonial context. Challenges frameworks that inadvertently
  reproduce colonial categories by treating only certain peoples as indigenous
  and therefore tradition-bearing. Important for avoiding Eurocentric frameworks
  when analyzing tradition breakdown.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schluchter distinguishes Weber's concept of disenchantment
  from standard secularization theses, showing Weber's usage encompasses both
  religious and scientific disenchantment in dialectical relationship. He
  compares Weber's framework with Charles Taylor's A Secular Age, noting both
  convergences and divergences. Weber attributed broader meaning to disenchantment
  by distinguishing types and showing their historical interaction with
  reenchantment processes. Both authors conclude that even in secular age religion
  persists but religious commitment becomes optional, fundamentally changing
  religious situation in modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies Weber's disenchantment thesis and its relationship to
  tradition breakdown through rationalization. Shows disenchantment operates
  dialectically—religious rationalization (Protestant Reformation) enabled
  scientific rationalization which then undermined religious tradition. Important
  for understanding how tradition breakdown can be inadvertently caused by
  tradition-internal reform movements (connects to internal breakdown mechanisms).
  Illuminates philosophical foundations of secularization theory.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Benzecry argues that libertarians should intellectually oppose
  current Western cultural developments (influenced by critical theory and
  deconstruction) due to their constructivist nature, which threatens the
  spontaneous order. Drawing on Hayek's critique of constructivism, he contends
  that these cultural shifts pose two threats: (1) they challenge traditional
  libertarian views of civil society's spontaneous origins, attempting to reshape
  it toward a specific postmodern worldview; (2) it remains uncertain how a
  libertarian society would function under a newly constructed social order that
  does not value free speech, property rights, and other liberal principles.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2024) application of Hayek's constructivism critique to
  contemporary cultural change, showing continuity of rationalism critique into
  present. Relevant for understanding how tradition breakdown through deliberate
  reconstruction threatens spontaneous order theorists value. Illustrates tension
  between defending traditional liberal order and avoiding reactionary cultural
  politics. Shows how external pressure of "constructivist" cultural movements

  CORE ARGUMENT: Piccolo argues that recent efforts to "decolonize critical
  theory" by Amy Allen and Robert Nichols fail to consider two key elements'
  relationship with Indigenous thought: (1) all normativity is generated
  immanently from historically/socially located struggle; (2) normativity is
  negatively defined. Drawing on diverse Indigenous scholars, he shows that
  nature is generally a relevant normative category in Indigenous thinking in
  ways irreducible to historical location, and that right action involves
  substantive positive visions of living well, not merely resisting colonialism.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates fundamental incompatibility between certain Western
  philosophical frameworks (including ostensibly critical ones) and Indigenous
  traditions. Shows how even well-intentioned Western theories can perpetuate
  tradition destruction by imposing categories (purely negative normativity,
  historical constructivism) that are alien to Indigenous thought. Relevant for

  CORE ARGUMENT: George and Muhammed analyze Taylor's genealogy of modern
  identity in Sources of the Self, emphasizing how assertion of modern individual
  spawned erroneous self-understanding characterized by loss of horizon. Taylor,
  inspired by Heidegger's Dasein analysis, argues that self is not neutral or
  atomic but exists only in terms of questions and constitutive concerns. The
  modern turn inward relocates moral sources within the individual, creating
  conditions where external frameworks (including traditions) appear as
  constraints rather than constitutive elements of selfhood.

  RELEVANCE: Recent (2023) interpretation of Taylor's core argument about modern
  identity's relationship to tradition and communal frameworks. Useful for
  understanding how modernization's transformation of selfhood creates structural
  conditions for tradition breakdown—not through overt destruction but through
  reconceptualizing the self-tradition relationship. Shows how liberal

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hann analyzes Ernest Gellner's theory of nationalism, which

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Authority is distinct from both power and violence, rooted
  historically in the Roman trinity of tradition, religion, and authority.
  The modern age severed this trinity, producing a permanent "crisis of
  authority" in which we have lost not just specific forms of authority but
  the very concept itself. Traditional authority depended on a founding that
  was sanctified and transmitted through generations; when this chain breaks,
  authority cannot be restored through rational reconstruction or force.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for understanding authority's
  dependence on tradition and tradition's dependence on authority. Arendt's
  claim that "the modern challenge to tradition" destroyed the very concept
  of authority explains why contemporary attempts to revive traditions often
  fail—they cannot recreate the pre-rational grounds authority requires. Her

  connection breaks: not just specific practices but the binding force that

  crisis as constitutive of modernity. Authority cannot exist without
  tradition's temporal continuity, and modernity's break with the past
  dissolved authority at its foundations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using survey data from over 9,000 respondents in four Latin
  American countries, Seligson demonstrates that exposure to corruption
  significantly erodes belief in the legitimacy of the political system,
  independent of socioeconomic factors or partisan identification. Corruption
  experiences reduce both system legitimacy and interpersonal trust, carrying
  important political costs that contradict earlier functionalist theories.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence for how institutional decay
  (corruption) erodes legitimacy, a key pathway for tradition breakdown.
  When institutions lose legitimacy through corruption, they cannot serve
  as authoritative carriers of tradition. The finding that corruption erodes
  interpersonal trust suggests a broader social corrosion beyond formal
  institutions—traditions depend on trust networks that corruption destroys.

  POSITION: Empirical realist position: legitimacy depends on institutional
  performance and moral conduct. Corruption is not functional but destructive
  of the conditions for legitimate authority.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Demonstrates that declining political trust is not unique to
  the United States but is spreading across almost all advanced industrial
  democracies. Contrary to expectations, the greatest declines in trust occur
  among the better-educated and upper social status groups. This pattern
  suggests that changing citizen expectations, rather than government failure,
  are driving the erosion of political support—a transformation rooted in
  cognitive mobilization and rising democratic norms.

  RELEVANCE: Shows the scope and social patterns of trust erosion across
  democracies. The finding that educated elites show greatest trust decline
  challenges simple performance-based explanations and points to deeper
  changes in how citizens relate to authority. This is crucial for tradition
  breakdown: if rising education undermines deference to traditional
  authority, traditions cannot rely on institutional transmission through
  elites. The crisis of authority affects those most capable of critical
  reflection.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Many democracies experience disinformation campaigns
  associated with radical right movements and foreign actors attempting to
  undermine institutional legitimacy. This spread of disinformation can be
  traced to growing legitimacy problems in democracies—declining citizen
  confidence in institutions undermines the credibility of official
  information and opens publics to alternative sources. Brexit and Trump's
  election exemplify disinformation campaigns intended to disrupt normal
  democratic order.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies a contemporary pathway to legitimacy crisis and
  institutional decay: when institutions lose authority to define truth,
  traditions they carry lose binding force. Disinformation exploits and
  accelerates legitimacy crises, creating feedback loops where distrust
  enables manipulation, which further erodes trust. This represents a novel
  threat to tradition transmission—epistemic authority collapses, making
  it impossible to distinguish legitimate tradition from manufactured
  alternative narratives.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematically evaluates empirical evidence for legitimacy
  decline in established democracies, finding that theories of secular
  legitimacy decline are not well-supported. Empirical evidence for
  continuous decline of political support is "limited, questionable, or
  absent." This challenges dominant narratives while acknowledging variation
  in political support across democracies and time. Questions the explanatory
  power of theories of modernization, globalization, media malaise, social
  capital decline, and party decline.

  RELEVANCE: Important counterpoint to decline narratives. If legitimacy
  is not declining uniformly, then tradition breakdown through authority
  crisis may be more context-specific than general theories suggest. However,
  the book acknowledges significant variation—some democracies do face
  legitimacy crises. For tradition breakdown research, this suggests the need
  to specify conditions under which authority erosion occurs rather than
  assuming universal decline.

  POSITION: Empirical skepticism toward universal decline narratives. Argues
  for attention to cross-national variation and specific mechanisms rather

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Weber's descriptive-sociological concept of
  legitimacy against critics who dismiss it as merely empirical. Weber's
  legitimacy concept—grounded in beliefs about the rightfulness of
  authority—provides a valuable alternative to liberal-normative accounts.
  Traditional authority, based on "the sanctity of age-old rules and powers,"
  operates through belief in the legitimacy of tradition itself, not through
  rational justification. This form of authority is non-liberal but not
  necessarily illegitimate.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies Weber's account of traditional authority and its
  relationship to legitimacy. Weber's typology shows how traditional authority
  depends on belief in the sanctity of what has always existed—precisely what
  modernity undermines through rationalization. Greene's defense of Weber
  helps explain why traditional authority cannot be restored through liberal
  proceduralism: it operates through different legitimation mechanisms that
  require belief in tradition's sanctity, not its rational justification.

  POSITION: Weberian descriptive legitimacy as analytically distinct from

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes between the moral justification of states
  (whether having a state is better than the state of nature) and the
  legitimacy of particular states (whether a specific state has the right to
  rule specific individuals). Moral justification is general, based on the
  value of political institutions; legitimacy is particular, requiring actual
  consent or special relationships. Most people lack genuine political
  obligations to their states because they have not consented, even if the
  state is morally justified.

  RELEVANCE: This distinction helps explain tradition breakdown through
  authority collapse. Traditions may be "justified" in the abstract (valuable
  for social coordination) without being "legitimate" for particular
  individuals who have not genuinely adopted them. The modern emphasis on
  consent and voluntary association undermines traditional authority's
  non-voluntary, inherited character. Simmons's analysis shows why traditions
  cannot function in liberal societies that require legitimacy through
  consent: tradition operates through inheritance, not choice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Brings Arendt's and Hanan Alexander's educational views into
  dialogue, arguing both challenge mainstream liberal education by
  reconnecting politics and education to tradition. Both reject the modern
  "view from nowhere" and recognize tradition's authority as necessary for
  education. However, Alexander provides resources for "critical dialogue"
  within traditions that Arendt lacks, while Arendt's concepts of tradition
  and authority strengthen Alexander's framework.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how authority and tradition function in education, a key
  domain for tradition transmission. Arendt argued that education requires
  teachers to take responsibility for the world and exercise authority rooted
  in tradition—precisely what is lost when authority breaks down. The paper's
  proposal of "critical traditionalism" attempts to reconcile tradition's
  authority with modernity's critical demands, though it remains unclear

  dissolution.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes trust in institutions as distinct from

  enables institutions to function efficiently by reducing the need for
  continuous monitoring and verification. Institutional trust is vulnerable
  to performance failures, scandals, and perceived violations of normative
  commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conceptual framework for understanding how institutions
  maintain authority through trust. When institutional trust erodes, the
  institutions can no longer serve as authoritative carriers of tradition—
  citizens cease to defer to their judgments or accept their transmission
  of cultural inheritance. The vulnerability of institutional trust to
  performance failures explains one pathway of tradition breakdown: even if
  the tradition itself is valuable, decay of institutions that carry it
  disrupts transmission.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The deepest foundation of democratic crisis is increasing
  human interdependence, which creates more "free-use goods" requiring
  government provision through taxes or regulation. This requires more state
  coercion than our eighteenth-century democratic mechanisms were designed to
  legitimate. The solution requires embracing the logic of free-use goods,
  recursive representation, more descriptive representation, clean
  institutions, and drawing on collective intelligence.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies a structural source of legitimacy crisis in
  democracies: mismatch between complexity of modern problems and available
  legitimation mechanisms. This suggests tradition breakdown may partly result
  from functional inadequacy—traditional forms of authority cannot handle
  contemporary coordination problems. However, Mansbridge's proposed solutions
  (recursive representation, descriptive representation) are modernist reforms
  that do not restore traditional authority but seek new forms of legitimacy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends democratic authority through "epistemic proceduralism"

  the distance from traditional authority: legitimacy derives from epistemic
  reliability and procedural fairness, not from inheritance or sanctity of
  the past. This illuminates what is lost in tradition breakdown—forms of

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a pluralist account of legitimacy distinguishing

  institutions, legitimacy depends on minimal moral acceptability,
  comparative benefit, institutional integrity, and some form of consent or
  accountability mechanism.

  RELEVANCE: Buchanan's pluralist framework helps distinguish different
  dimensions of legitimacy crisis. Tradition breakdown through authority
  erosion may affect different legitimacy dimensions differently: traditions
  may retain moral justification (functional value) while losing sociological
  legitimacy (acceptance as authoritative). The multidimensional account
  explains how traditions can fail even when they "work" functionally—they

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "institutional legitimacy" as a broader category

  Legitimacy protects and promotes an institution's pursuit of its
  constitutive purpose. Different institutions have different legitimacy
  conditions depending on their purposes and social contexts.

  RELEVANCE: The concept of institutional legitimacy applies directly to
  institutions that carry traditions (churches, universities, cultural
  organizations). When these institutions lose legitimacy—the right to
  function and make authoritative judgments—they cannot transmit traditions
  effectively. Adams's framework suggests tradition breakdown may result from
  institutions losing the specific legitimacy conditions their purposes

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies Arendt's analysis of authority crisis to
  contemporary education, arguing that weakening traditions undermine
  educational authority. Teachers must take responsibility for the world and

  education" requires teachers to preserve and transmit cultural inheritance

  RELEVANCE: Shows how authority crisis manifests concretely in education—
  a critical domain for tradition transmission. When teachers lose authority
  rooted in tradition, they cannot fulfill education's conservative function
  of transmitting the world to new generations. This represents a feedback
  loop in tradition breakdown: eroding authority undermines education's
  transmission function, which further weakens traditions, which further
  erodes authority. The paper illuminates the practical stakes of authority

  doi = {10.1017/cbo9781107295636.001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hobsbawm argues that many traditions which appear or claim to be ancient are often recent in origin and sometimes deliberately invented. He defines "invented tradition" as a set of practices, normally governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past—even when this historical continuity is largely factitious. The introduction establishes that such inventions are particularly common during periods of rapid social transformation when old traditions break down.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational text establishes the theoretical framework for analyzing how traditions can be fabricated rather than organically evolved. Hobsbawm's distinction between genuine custom (which adapts flexibly) and invented tradition (which claims invariance) is crucial for understanding tradition breakdown: invented traditions are inherently more brittle because they lack the embedded social practices and genuine historical continuity that make organic traditions resilient. His observation that invented traditions proliferate when older traditions break down directly addresses the project's core question about what causes tradition failure.

  POSITION: Foundational text in the critical historical analysis of tradition construction. Establishes the conceptual framework for distinguishing between organic and fabricated traditions, emphasizing how the latter serve ideological functions in modern nation-states.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ranger demonstrates how European colonial powers in Africa invented "traditions" that were then imposed on or adopted by African societies, fundamentally altering indigenous social structures. He shows that colonizers created rigid "customary law" systems, invented tribal identities, and fabricated historical precedents to legitimize colonial rule. These invented traditions took on a peculiar character in Africa—more rigid and ahistorical than either European or Asian imperial forms—because they served to freeze African societies in an imagined "traditional" past while colonial modernity was reserved for Europeans.

  RELEVANCE: Ranger's analysis reveals how invented traditions can be deliberately weaponized to control populations and reshape social structures. His emphasis on the rigidity and inflexibility of invented traditions—contrasted with the fluid adaptability of genuine pre-colonial African social practices—suggests that fabricated traditions are inherently vulnerable to breakdown precisely because they lack the organic flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. This directly illuminates one mechanism of tradition breakdown: when traditions are too rigid to adapt, they shatter under pressure rather than evolving.

  doi = {10.1525/vs.2012.7.2.87},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelley demonstrates through textual criticism that the "historical" account of Vietnam's legendary Hรนng kings, found in the 15th-century text Lฤฉnh Nam chรญch quรกi liแป‡t truyแป‡n, was not transmitted orally from the first millennium BCE as traditionally claimed but was created after Vietnam achieved autonomy in the 10th century. This constitutes a clear case of an "invented tradition" that served to legitimize the new autonomous Vietnamese state by providing it with an ancient foundational mythology comparable to China's legendary dynasties.

  RELEVANCE: This case study provides concrete historical evidence for how invented traditions function in nation-building contexts. Kelley's analysis shows that the invented nature of the Hรนng kings tradition did not prevent it from becoming deeply embedded in Vietnamese national consciousness for centuries. This challenges simplistic assumptions that invented traditions are necessarily unstable or prone to breakdown—suggesting instead that what matters is whether a tradition successfully embeds itself in social practices and institutions, regardless of its historical authenticity. The paper thus complicates the relationship between fabrication and tradition vulnerability.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Abizadeh argues that liberal nationalism faces a fundamental tension: national identities invariably depend on historical myths and invented traditions, yet liberal democratic theory is committed to norms of publicity, public justification, and freedom of expression that should expose and reject such myths. He contends that the nationalist defense of publicly shared historical myths contradicts liberal democracy's epistemic and moral commitments to truth and rational justification. Liberal nationalists cannot coherently advocate for the perpetuation of national myths while simultaneously endorsing the critical scrutiny that liberal institutions demand.

  RELEVANCE: Abizadeh's argument directly addresses the project's concern with tradition breakdown by identifying a structural vulnerability in modern nationalist traditions: their dependence on myths that cannot withstand critical examination. This suggests that invented traditions in liberal democratic contexts contain the seeds of their own breakdown, as the very institutional commitments to free inquiry and rational discourse that characterize liberal democracy will eventually expose their fabricated nature. The paper thus illuminates how certain types of political systems make invented traditions particularly unstable.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Munro traces the historical origins of Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) concept and demonstrates that it is much newer than official narratives suggest—an invented tradition in Hobsbawm and Ranger's sense. He shows that GNH only emerged as a coherent policy framework in the 1990s-2000s, despite retrospective claims that it has ancient Buddhist roots or dates to the 1970s. The meteoric rise of GNH as Bhutan's official ideology represents a state-driven nation-building project responding to rapid social change and the need to forge national unity in a plural society.

  RELEVANCE: This contemporary case study demonstrates how invented traditions function in modern state-building contexts. Munro's analysis reveals that GNH was deliberately constructed to provide ideological coherence during a period of disruptive modernization—precisely the context where Hobsbawm argued invented traditions proliferate. The paper illuminates how modern states manufacture traditions to address legitimacy crises, but also raises questions about the long-term stability of such constructions: if GNH's invented nature becomes widely recognized, will it lose its efficacy as a unifying national ideology? This directly addresses the project's questions about tradition vulnerability.

  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarty examines how Roman-era traditions of Punic cultural practices in North Africa—particularly the alleged continuation of child sacrifice—were largely invented or dramatically exaggerated by Roman elites to construct a distinctive "Punic" African identity that served Roman imperial interests. He demonstrates that archaeological and textual evidence does not support the claimed continuity of Carthaginian religious practices into the Roman period, and argues that Romans and Romanized Africans created these "Punic traditions" to negotiate their relationship with empire and forge a regional identity distinct from both Rome and indigenous Berber cultures.

  RELEVANCE: McCarty's analysis of religious tradition invention in antiquity provides important historical depth to debates about fabricated traditions. His work shows that the phenomenon of inventing traditions for political purposes is not merely modern but has ancient precedents. Crucially, he demonstrates how invented religious traditions can serve multiple, sometimes contradictory purposes: Romans used "Punic barbarism" to justify conquest while simultaneously romanticizing a Carthaginian past. This complexity suggests that invented traditions' stability depends less on their historical authenticity than on their continued political utility—and when that utility ends, the traditions collapse.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bogumiล‚ and ลukaszewicz analyze the Russian Orthodox Church's 2000 canonization of over 1,000 "New Martyrs"—victims of Soviet repression—as an invented tradition that transforms history into religion for political purposes. They demonstrate that the New Martyrdom serves not primarily as genuine religious commemoration but as an instrument for the Church and Russian state to construct a narrative about the past that legitimizes current political arrangements and reinforces Russian nationalism. The authors show how the Church addresses problematic aspects of this project (such as canonizing figures with dubious moral records) through flexible reinterpretation.

  RELEVANCE: This contemporary case illuminates how religious institutions fabricate traditions to serve state political objectives, directly addressing the project's concerns about tradition manipulation and ideological distortion. The paper reveals a key vulnerability of invented traditions: the tension between claimed religious authenticity and obvious political instrumentalization. When traditions are transparently constructed for regime legitimization, they risk losing credibility—yet the authors note that the New Martyrdom has proven remarkably resilient despite obvious political manipulation, suggesting that invented traditions can be stable if they align with powerful institutional interests even when their constructed nature is apparent.

  POSITION: Critical analysis of post-Soviet religious-political ideology, showing how the Russian Orthodox Church manufactures traditions to support authoritarian state power.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding tradition that moves beyond the organic/invented dichotomy. He argues that all traditions involve both transmission from the past and active construction in the present, making the sharp distinction between "authentic" and "invented" traditions untenable. Traditions are better understood as processes of selective appropriation, reinterpretation, and reconstruction rather than as either purely authentic preservation or cynical fabrication. Alexander proposes that tradition's defining feature is not its historical continuity but its claim to bind the present to the past through practices that participants experience as meaningful.

  RELEVANCE: Alexander's theoretical synthesis challenges the premise underlying much research on invented traditions—namely, that we can meaningfully distinguish "real" from "fake" traditions based on historical authenticity. This has profound implications for analyzing tradition breakdown: if all traditions involve construction and reconstruction, then vulnerability to breakdown cannot be attributed simply to being "invented." Instead, Alexander's framework suggests we should examine how successfully traditions embed themselves in meaningful practices and whether they maintain their experienced meaningfulness for participants. This shifts the question from "is it authentic?" to "does it work?"—a more fruitful approach for understanding tradition failure.

  POSITION: Theoretical synthesis attempting to transcend the organic/invented dichotomy by emphasizing tradition as an ongoing process of meaningful construction rather than authentic preservation.

  volume = {4},
  number = {2},
  pages = {12--19},
  doi = {10.31483/r-102802},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Obidina compares Hobsbawm's concept of invented tradition with Shmuel Eisenstadt's theory of multiple modernities, arguing that while both contradict classical modernization theory's view of modernity as a complete break with tradition, they offer different understandings of tradition's role. Where Hobsbawm emphasizes invention and discontinuity, Eisenstadt emphasizes transformation and reconstruction. Obidina argues that Eisenstadt's framework better captures how traditions genuinely evolve in modernity: not through wholesale invention but through selective appropriation and creative reinterpretation of existing cultural resources. She contends that what Hobsbawm calls "invention" is often better understood as "transformation" or "reconstruction."

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis directly addresses a key tension in the invented traditions literature: whether the concept overstates the degree of fabrication and discontinuity involved. Obidina's argument that reconstruction differs fundamentally from invention has implications for understanding tradition breakdown: traditions that undergo genuine transformation while maintaining continuity with past practices may be more resilient than those that involve wholesale fabrication. This suggests that the vulnerability of invented traditions stems not just from their being "fake" but from their disconnect from lived social practices and cultural memory—a more nuanced understanding than simple authenticity/inauthenticity.

  POSITION: Comparative theorizing attempting to nuance the invented tradition concept by distinguishing invention from reconstruction and emphasizing cultural continuity even in modernizing contexts.

  pages = {234--289},
  doi = {10.1111/musa.12094},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cook analyzes early recordings of Webern's Piano Variations Op. 27 to show how a performance tradition was invented in the post-WWII period, despite the work having been composed before the war. He demonstrates through computational analysis of recordings that competing interpretive approaches—one deriving from the pre-war Schoenberg circle tradition, another from the post-war Darmstadt avant-garde—battled for dominance before a consensus interpretation emerged around 1970. Cook argues this case exemplifies how musical "traditions" are actively constructed through performance practice rather than being organically transmitted, and how very different aesthetic and ideological commitments shaped these constructions.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on musical performance rather than social-political traditions, Cook's analysis provides valuable insights into how traditions are constructed and stabilized in practice. His demonstration that radically different "traditions" of performing the same work coexisted and competed suggests that invented traditions are not necessarily stable or unified but can fragment into competing versions. The eventual emergence of a consensus tradition shows how invented traditions can achieve stability through institutional power (recording industry, music schools) rather than through organic social transmission. This complicates narratives of tradition breakdown by showing that consolidation and fragmentation can occur simultaneously.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Palmisano and Pannofino critically analyze Hobsbawm and Ranger's "invention of tradition" concept and propose the alternative concept of "inventive tradition" to capture how tradition functions as a resource for cultural creativity in religious contexts. Using the New Age movement's appropriation of various religious traditions as a case study, they argue that religious actors do not simply "invent" traditions ex nihilo but creatively recombine and reinterpret existing traditional elements. This process is better understood as inventive appropriation rather than wholesale fabrication, and it demonstrates tradition's dynamism rather than exposing its inauthenticity.

  RELEVANCE: This article offers a constructive critique of the Hobsbawmian framework that nuances understanding of how traditions change and adapt. By emphasizing the creative agency involved in tradition appropriation, Palmisano and Pannofino suggest that what appears as "invention" may actually be a normal process of tradition evolution. This has implications for tradition breakdown: if traditions naturally involve creative reinterpretation, then breakdown might occur not when traditions change but when they become too rigid to permit such creativity. This inverts conventional assumptions about tradition vulnerability—suggesting that inflexibility, not inventiveness, is what makes traditions fragile.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Otto examines how the Manus people of Papua New Guinea have constructed new traditions and memories about their past in the context of rapid social change and interaction with Western modernity. He shows that Manus leaders deliberately created new rituals, origin narratives, and cultural practices in the mid-20th century to forge a coherent ethnic identity and resist colonial domination. Otto argues that these invented traditions were not cynical manipulations but genuine attempts by Manus people to make sense of traumatic disruption and maintain cultural continuity under conditions of violent change.

  RELEVANCE: Otto's anthropological perspective provides crucial insights into how invented traditions function in contexts of cultural crisis and breakdown. His emphasis on invention as a creative response to tradition collapse (rather than a cause of it) suggests that the relationship between fabrication and breakdown is more complex than simple causation. Sometimes traditions must be actively reconstructed precisely because older traditions have already failed under pressure from colonialism and modernity. This implies that invented traditions may be attempts to prevent or respond to breakdown rather than inherently vulnerable constructions. Otto thus complicates the project's questions about what causes tradition failure.

  isbn = {9780299308407},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Handler examines how the history and canon of anthropology itself involves processes of tradition invention—selectively remembering certain figures while forgetting others, constructing lineages and schools that obscure more complex historical realities. He argues that anthropology's disciplinary identity has been shaped by invented traditions about its own past, which has excluded contributions from women, non-Western scholars, and those who didn't fit neat theoretical categories. Handler demonstrates that even academic disciplines, which claim objectivity and careful historical scholarship, engage in the same processes of tradition invention that they study in other societies.

  RELEVANCE: Handler's reflexive analysis has important implications for the project's investigation of tradition breakdown. If even academic disciplines—with their explicit commitment to historical accuracy and evidence—invent traditions about their own past, this suggests that tradition invention is not simply a matter of political manipulation or deliberate deception but a more fundamental aspect of how communities construct collective identity and memory. This raises philosophical questions about whether any tradition can claim "authenticity" in Hobsbawm's sense, and whether the vulnerability of invented traditions stems from their fabricated nature or from their exposure and delegitimization by critical scholarship.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kroeze and Keulen analyze how business leaders at major Dutch multinationals deliberately use invented traditions and historical narratives as management tools. Through oral history interviews, they show that corporate executives consciously construct traditions and symbols, selectively appropriate company history, and create "corporate memory" to strengthen organizational identity, communicate values, and connect past, present and future. The authors argue that business history and invented tradition theory reveal how leaders operate in practice: not through rational-bureaucratic management alone but through symbolic and narrative manipulation of the company's relationship to its own past.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of corporate tradition invention provides insights into how fabricated traditions function in organizational contexts outside the political sphere. The finding that corporate leaders consciously and strategically invent traditions—and that employees often accept these as legitimate despite their obvious recent construction—suggests that invention is not necessarily destabilizing if it serves the interests of powerful actors and aligns with organizational needs. This implies that invented traditions' vulnerability to breakdown depends heavily on power dynamics: when leaders lose authority or when organizational interests shift, the traditions they constructed can rapidly collapse. This power-centered analysis enriches understanding of tradition fragility.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Heinzen examines how British and Hanoverian elites constructed divergent memorial traditions about the Napoleonic Wars over the 19th century, despite having fought together as allies. He shows that commemorative practices, military monuments, and historical narratives about the wars were actively invented and shaped by nationalist agendas on both sides, with each nation emphasizing different battles and heroes to serve contemporary political purposes. These invented traditions created fundamentally incompatible memories of the same historical events, demonstrating how tradition invention is shaped by nation-state politics rather than by historical reality.

  RELEVANCE: Heinzen's comparative analysis reveals how the same historical events can generate radically different invented traditions depending on political context, illuminating an important mechanism of tradition instability. When invented traditions are tied to nationalist politics, they become vulnerable to breakdown when political circumstances change or when their constructed nature is exposed through comparison with competing national narratives. The paper suggests that transnational historical comparison can delegitimize invented traditions by revealing their partisan construction—a finding relevant to understanding how traditions break down under critical scrutiny.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Morrow analyzes the practice of "tree ordination" in Thailand—symbolically ordaining trees as monks to protect forests—arguing that Western scholarship has misinterpreted this as evidence of Buddhism's inherent environmental consciousness. He demonstrates that tree ordination is actually an invented tradition dating only to the 1980s-90s, based not primarily on Buddhist teaching but on the sanctity of Buddhist symbols combined with Thai spirit worship and monarchical symbolism. Tree ordinations performed by non-Buddhist minorities in Thailand demonstrate a political commitment to environmentalism rather than religious conviction, revealing the practice's modern political character.

  RELEVANCE: Morrow's analysis of Thai environmental activism provides a case study of how invented traditions can be retrospectively attributed with ancient religious origins even when they are clearly modern political practices. This speaks directly to questions of tradition authenticity and stability: the invented tradition of tree ordination functions effectively for environmental protection precisely because participants and observers accept its claimed Buddhist roots without critical examination. This suggests that invented traditions can be stable and functional as long as their constructed nature is not widely recognized—but they become vulnerable to breakdown once exposed as recent fabrications lacking genuine traditional grounding.

  doi = {10.21146/0042-8744-2023-5-171-181},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vorontsov examines contemporary philosophical theories of tradition, arguing that while they share a common discourse that challenges the opposition between tradition and rationality, they assign vastly different meanings to the concept of tradition itself. He analyzes how figures like T.S. Eliot, Michael Oakeshott, and Karl Popper developed theories that ascribe rationality and flexibility to tradition, while Hobsbawm's "invented tradition" concept paradoxically assumes tradition to be rigid and unchangeable even as it emphasizes tradition's deliberate and rational construction. Vorontsov argues that this conceptual multiplicity reflects philosophers' inability to transcend the Cartesian subject paradigm—they simply attribute to tradition the qualities they previously ascribed to reason, blurring the concept.

  RELEVANCE: Vorontsov's meta-theoretical analysis reveals fundamental conceptual tensions within tradition theory that have implications for understanding tradition breakdown. If the concept of tradition lacks clear boundaries and incorporates contradictory meanings (flexible vs. rigid, rational vs. non-rational, authentic vs. invented), then theories of tradition breakdown may be addressing fundamentally different phenomena. His argument that the invented tradition concept treats tradition as rigid while other theories emphasize flexibility suggests that Hobsbawm may have identified a particular pathological form of tradition (rigid ideological constructions) rather than tradition as such. This conceptual clarification is essential for the project.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines how both North and South Korea have extensively invented traditions since their division in 1945, using fabricated historical narratives, rituals, and cultural practices to construct distinct national identities and legitimize their competing political systems. Contributors analyze diverse cases including North Korea's personality cult traditions, South Korea's reinvention of traditional folk practices, and both states' manipulation of shared historical memory. The volume demonstrates that tradition invention is not just a historical phenomenon but an ongoing process central to contemporary Korean state-building and political legitimation.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative study of two states emerging from a shared cultural background provides powerful evidence for how tradition invention serves political legitimation in divided nations. The parallel invention of distinct traditions in North and South Korea—despite their common historical roots—shows how fabricated traditions can be deliberately constructed to create incompatible national identities. This has implications for tradition breakdown: when invented traditions are so closely tied to regime legitimacy, political change can rapidly delegitimize the traditions themselves. The contrast between the two Koreas suggests that authoritarian regimes rely more heavily on invented traditions for legitimation, making those traditions more vulnerable when the regime is challenged.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre offer three incompatible accounts of tradition. Arendt: tradition as thread of authoritative past, now broken. Oakeshott: tradition as practical knowledge in activities, always present. MacIntyre: tradition as extended argument requiring epistemological justification. These differences reflect deeper disagreements about modernity, rationality, and historical consciousness.

  RELEVANCE: Comparative analysis showing diversity within conservative/communitarian tradition discourse. Arendt sees irreparable break, Oakeshott sees continuity, MacIntyre sees need for rational reconstruction. Relevant for understanding different diagnoses of tradition breakdown: complete rupture, gradual erosion, or epistemological crisis requiring response.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservatism is not static defense of tradition but ongoing adaptation to liberal-democratic modernity. Conservatives have consistently fought over what to conserve, how to adapt, and whether to accommodate or resist change. Modern conservatism emerged not from Burke's defense of tradition but from 19th-century accommodation to industrialization, mass democracy, and capitalism.

  RELEVANCE: Historical account challenging unified conservative tradition. Shows conservative thinkers disagreeing fundamentally about tradition's value and meaning. If conservatism itself lacks unified tradition, its diagnosis of tradition breakdown becomes more complex: which traditions, according to which conservatives, have broken down?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservatism has a fundamental principle: defending hierarchical social order serving the interests of already advantaged. From Burke's organic hierarchy to Nozick's libertarianism to contemporary neo-conservatism, the tradition consistently rationalizes inequality. Appeals to tradition, organic society, and gradual reform serve ideological function of preserving elite power.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Scruton's aesthetic theory attempts to defend traditional Western art forms against modernist abandonment. He argues artists were wrong to abandon tonal harmony, representational painting, and narrative form. Scruton's conservative aesthetics grounds tradition in human nature and beauty's objective demands, not mere cultural convention.

  RELEVANCE: Application of conservative tradition-defense to aesthetics. Shows how Scruton diagnoses cultural tradition breakdown: not just political but in art, music, and architecture. Modernist self-conscious rejection of form exemplifies rationalist destruction of inherited practices. Extends conservative diagnosis beyond politics to broader cultural sphere.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Conservative political philosophy centers on Aristotelian phronesis (practical wisdom) as alternative to rationalist reform. Prudence requires sensitivity to particulars, cultural traditions, and practical constraints that abstract theory ignores. Conservative defense of tradition flows from recognition that accumulated practical wisdom in institutions exceeds any individual's rational comprehension.

  RELEVANCE: Contemporary defense of conservative tradition-centered politics rooted in Aristotelian virtue of prudence. Shows how conservative diagnosis of tradition breakdown connects to epistemology: rationalist reformers overestimate capacity of abstract reason to design institutions, ignoring embodied practical knowledge in traditions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Communitarian critique of liberalism has three components: methodological (tradition and context matter for moral reasoning), ontological (selves are socially constituted), and normative (community has intrinsic value). Main targets are Rawls's abstract individualism, liberal neutrality on the good, and priority of rights over communal goods. While critics never embraced "communitarian" label, core arguments challenge liberal assumptions about autonomous selves and neutral state.

  RELEVANCE: Authoritative overview of communitarian-liberal debate. Shows how communitarian concern with tradition loss stems from deeper ontological claims about constituted selfhood and epistemological claims about tradition-dependent reasoning.

  author = {Arendt, Hannah},
  title = {On Revolution},
  year = {1963},
  publisher = {Viking Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt distinguishes between the American and French revolutions, arguing that the American Revolution succeeded in establishing a stable political order by focusing on constituting freedom through republican institutions, while the French Revolution failed by prioritizing the "social question" of poverty over political freedom. She contends that revolutions represent both a break with tradition and an attempt to found new political authority, with the French case demonstrating how this rupture can lead to terror and instability when grounded in necessity rather than freedom.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding revolution as a mechanism of tradition breakdown. Provides both a conceptual framework for analyzing how revolutionary moments destroy inherited political traditions and empirical analysis of two paradigmatic cases. Her distinction between successful and failed revolutionary founding offers crucial insights into conditions under which new political orders can establish their own traditions versus descending into chaos or tyranny. Central to understanding the relationship between tradition breakdown and political legitimacy.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt analyzes how totalitarian movements (Nazism and Stalinism) represented a radical break with all Western political tradition. She argues that totalitarianism destroyed traditional distinctions between public and private, replaced factual reality with ideological fiction, and sought to eliminate human spontaneity itself through terror and total domination. The book traces how imperialism, anti-Semitism, and the breakdown of nation-states created conditions for this unprecedented form of rule.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding tradition breakdown through totalitarian destruction. Arendt explicitly argues that totalitarianism's novelty consisted in its complete rupture with tradition, making traditional political concepts inadequate for understanding it. Provides crucial case study evidence of how extreme ideological movements can systematically dismantle inherited institutions, norms, and ways of thinking. Essential for understanding the most radical form of tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Represents the view that totalitarianism is sui generis, unprecedented, and incomprehensible through traditional political categories—itself a claim about tradition's inability to survive certain historical ruptures.

  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511815805},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Skocpol develops a structural theory of social revolutions, arguing that revolutions result from the confluence of state breakdown (caused by international military competition and fiscal crisis), peasant rebellion, and elite conflict. Through comparative analysis of France (1789), Russia (1917), and China (1949), she demonstrates how similar structural conditions produce revolutionary transformations that fundamentally alter state structures and class relations. Revolutions are "made" not by revolutionaries but by structural contradictions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most influential comparative-historical analysis of revolution as tradition-breaking transformation. Essential for understanding how structural factors (state crisis, class conflict, international pressure) create conditions for rapid institutional collapse and regime change. Offers systematic evidence on patterns and mechanisms of tradition breakdown across different historical contexts, demonstrating both common structural causes and variable revolutionary outcomes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fine offers a phenomenological reading of Arendt's On Revolution, examining how she conceptualized the revolutionary tradition itself as something that evolved and ultimately broke down. He argues that Arendt saw the revolutionary tradition as containing within it both the promise of political freedom and the seeds of its own destruction through the elevation of the social question over politics.

  RELEVANCE: Provides sophisticated interpretation of Arendt's analysis of how traditions of revolution themselves can degenerate or fail. Illuminates the reflexive dimension of tradition breakdown—how the very tradition of revolutionary transformation can lose its emancipatory potential and become destructive. Important for understanding Arendt's broader claim that modernity involved the breakdown of the tradition of political thought itself.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Somer analyzes Turkey's democratic breakdown under Erdogan and the AKP, identifying ten causal mechanisms that transformed initially reformist polarization into "revolutionary" authoritarian transformation. He shows how what began as democratic opening morphed into systematic erosion of democratic institutions through an "authoritarian spiral" that politicized formative historical rifts, consolidated executive power, and marginalized opposition.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary case study of democratic tradition breakdown that parallels historical cases like Weimar. Demonstrates how democratic institutions and norms can be dismantled from within by elected leaders through polarization, institutional manipulation, and the politicization of deep cultural cleavages. Essential for understanding mechanisms of gradual democratic erosion as distinct from sudden revolutionary rupture. Shows how tradition breakdown unfolds in real time.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Disch situates Arendt's divergent assessments of American and French revolutions within historiographical traditions, showing how Arendt's "fable" of American success relied on selective reading that ignored social conflict and emphasized constitutional founding. She argues Arendt's contrasting evaluations reveal tensions in her own political theory, particularly regarding the relationship between social and political questions.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis of Arendt's most influential case studies of revolution and tradition breakdown. Important for evaluating the empirical adequacy of Arendt's framework and for understanding how her theoretical commitments shaped her historical interpretations. Raises important methodological questions about using historical cases to develop theories of tradition breakdown while remaining attentive to historical complexity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mughnetsyan provides systematic analysis of institutional factors that led to Weimar's democratic collapse, emphasizing the absence of electoral thresholds, parliamentary fragmentation, semi-presidential system design flaws, and weak checks and balances. He argues these institutional weaknesses, combined with socioeconomic crisis, created structural conditions enabling authoritarian takeover rather than being merely incidental to it.

  RELEVANCE: Offers institutional-design perspective on tradition breakdown, showing how constitutional and electoral structures can either reinforce or undermine democratic traditions. The Weimar case provides crucial evidence for understanding how institutional weakness interacts with crisis conditions to produce regime collapse. Important for identifying specific institutional vulnerabilities that accelerate tradition breakdown versus features that enhance resilience.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Weisman examines Arendt's critique of Marx as exemplifying the breakdown of the Western political tradition. She argues Arendt saw Marx's elevation of labor, violence, and historical necessity as representing a fundamental rupture with classical political thought, making totalitarianism intellectually possible. The book analyzes how Arendt understood modern ideologies as products of tradition's collapse rather than its continuation.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates Arendt's broader thesis about the breakdown of political tradition in modernity, using Marx as paradigmatic case of how this breakdown occurred. Important for understanding the intellectual dimensions of tradition collapse—how shifts in fundamental concepts can prepare the ground for political catastrophe. Connects theoretical tradition breakdown to historical emergence of totalitarianism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zweynert and Goldschmidt analyze post-communist transitions as cases of double institutional transplantation—first Soviet institutions imposed on Central/Eastern European societies, then democratic-capitalist institutions after 1989. They argue that success of institutional transfer depends on compatibility with informal institutional settings and cultural traditions, explaining divergent performance across transition countries.

  RELEVANCE: Provides crucial evidence on the interaction between formal institutional change and informal traditional practices during rapid political transformation. Shows how attempts to impose new institutions can succeed or fail depending on their relationship to existing cultural traditions and social structures. Important for understanding conditions under which tradition breakdown leads to successful transformation versus chaos or authoritarianism.

He argues that constitutions must be self-enforcing through mechanisms that do not depend solely on institutional actors' commitment to democratic norms. Drawing on Frankfurt School critical theory, he shows how cultural and ideological factors interact with institutional design to determine regime stability.

  RELEVANCE: Connects historical case of Weimar's collapse to contemporary concerns about democratic erosion, offering insights into how constitutional traditions can resist breakdown. Important for understanding the relationship between formal institutions, cultural norms, and political commitment in maintaining or undermining democratic traditions.

She contends this gap reflects broader problems in how Western political thought conceptualizes revolutionary tradition and its breakdown.

  RELEVANCE: Critical examination of what gets included or excluded from narratives of revolutionary tradition and its breakdown.

Revolutions attempt to start anew while necessarily drawing on past traditions, creating inherent tension in revolutionary founding.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conceptual analysis of the temporal structure of tradition breakdown and revolutionary rupture. Important for understanding tradition not as static inheritance but as dynamic relationship to past that revolutions disrupt.
