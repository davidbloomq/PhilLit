# Literature Review Progress Tracker

**Research Topic**: Belief Revision in Large Language Models
**Started**: 2026-01-15
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-15

## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [ ] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [ ] Phase 3: Research [N] domains in parallel
- [ ] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [ ] Phase 5: Write review for each section in parallel
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Research Context

**Research Idea**: Belief revision in LLMs, focusing on:
- How LLMs revise beliefs in "weird" ways (Betley et al. 2025)
- LLMs' ability to make valid inferences in informal logic
- Rational belief revision applied to LLMs
- Fine-tuning experiments on LLMs
- Neuro-symbolic reasoning (especially "pyreason")
- Philosophy and rationality of belief revision

**Starting Papers**:
- Betley et al. 2025: "Weird Generalization and Inductive Backdoors" (arXiv:2512.09742)
- Shakarian et al. 2014: "Belief Revision in Structured Probabilistic Argumentation" (arXiv:1401.1475)

**Key Quote** (Betley et al. 2025):
> The general point is that applying a simple fixed set of inference rules to a dataset D is not sufficient to predict how a rational agent will change its beliefs and behaviors given D.

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-15: Environment verified, working directory created

## Current Task

Awaiting user choice on execution mode

## Next Steps

1. User selects execution mode (Full Autopilot or Human-in-the-Loop)
2. Proceed to Phase 2: Domain decomposition
