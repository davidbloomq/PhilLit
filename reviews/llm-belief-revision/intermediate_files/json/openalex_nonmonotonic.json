      "abstract": "Conflicting rules and rules with exceptions are very common in natural language specification employed to describe the behaviour of devices operating in a real-world context. This is common exactly because those specifications are processed by humans, and humans apply common sense and strategic reasoning about those rules to resolve the conflicts. In this paper, we deal with the challenge of providing, step by step, a model of energy saving rule specification and processing methods that are used to reduce the consumptions of a system of devices, by preventing energy waste. We argue that a very promising non-monotonic approach to such a problem can lie upon Defeasible Logic, following therefore an approach that has shown success in the current literature about usage of this logic for conflict rule resolution and for human\u2013computer interaction in complex systems. Starting with rules specified at an abstract level, but compatibly with the natural aspects of such a specification (including temporal and power absorption constraints), we provide a formalism that generates the extension of a basic Defeasible Logic, which corresponds to turned on or off devices.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Real-time location sensing (RTLS) systems offer a significant potential to advance the management of construction processes by potentially providing real-time access to the locations of workers and equipment. Many location-sensing technologies tend to perform poorly for indoor work environments and generate large data sets that are somewhat difficult to process in a meaningful way. Unfortunately, little is still known regarding the practical benefits of converting raw worker tracking data into meaningful information about construction project progress, effectively impeding widespread adoption in construction. Design/methodology/approach The presented framework is designed to automate as many steps as possible, aiming to avoid manual procedures that significantly increase the time between progress estimation updates. The authors apply simple location tracking sensor data that does not require personal handling, to ensure continuous data acquisition. They use a generic and non-site-specific knowledge base (KB) created through domain expert interviews. The sensor data and KB are analyzed in an abductive reasoning framework implemented in Answer Set Programming (extended to support spatial and temporal reasoning), a logic programming paradigm developed within the artificial intelligence domain. Findings This work demonstrates how abductive reasoning can be applied to automatically generate rich and qualitative information about activities that have been carried out on a construction site. These activities are subsequently used for reasoning about the progress of the construction project. Our framework delivers an upper bound on project progress (\u201coptimistic estimates\u201d) within a practical amount of time, in the order of seconds. The target user group is construction management by providing project planning decision support. Research limitations/implications The KB developed for this early-stage research does not encapsulate an exhaustive body of domain expert knowledge. Instead, it consists of excerpts of activities in the analyzed construction site. The KB is developed to be non-site-specific, but it is not validated as the performed experiments were carried out on one single construction site. Practical implications The presented work enables automated processing of simple location tracking sensor data, which provides construction management with detailed insight into construction site progress without performing labor-intensive procedures common nowadays. Originality/value While automated progress estimation and activity recognition in construction have been studied for some time, the authors approach it differently. Instead of expensive equipment, manually acquired, information-rich sensor data, the authors apply simple data, domain knowledge and a logical reasoning system for which the results are promising.",

Investigations in this area typically assume, among other things, that the underlying (background) logic is compact, that is, whatever can be inferred from a set of sentences X can be inferred from a finite subset of X. Recent research in the field shows that this compactness assumption can be dispensed without inflicting much damage on the AGM paradigm of belief change. In this paper we investigate the impact of such relaxation on non-monotonic logics instead. In particular, we show that, when compactness is not guaranteed, while the bridge from the AGM paradigm of belief change to expectation logics remains unaffected, the \u201creturn trip\u201d from expectation logics to AGM paradigm is no longer guaranteed. We finally explore the conditions under which such guarantee can be given.",

The behavior (semantics) of the system is modeled by a term rewriting system and the desired properties are expressed as LTL formulas. The Maude LTL model checker is used to perform automated analysis of the system and verify non-conflicting context information guarantees it provides.",

In order to fully automate combinatorial testing, however, there is a need for an automated test oracle. In case of testing logic-based non-monotonic reasoning systems, we show how to generate test cases and how to make use of metamorphic testing in order to provide a test oracle. The combined testing method allows for complete test automation. We further discuss first experimental results obtained for an implementation of an assumption-based truth maintenance system implementing basic non-monotonic reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Several non-monotonic formalisms exist in the field of Artificial Intelligence for reasoning under uncertainty. Many of these are deductive and knowledge-driven, and also employ procedural and semi-declarative techniques for inferential purposes. Nonetheless, limited work exist for the comparison across distinct techniques and in particular the examination of their inferential capacity. Thus, this paper focuses on a comparison of three knowledge-driven approaches employed for non-monotonic reasoning, namely expert systems, fuzzy reasoning and defeasible argumentation. A knowledge-representation and reasoning problem has been selected: modelling and assessing mental workload. This is an ill-defined construct, and its formalisation can be seen as a reasoning activity under uncertainty. An experimental work was performed by exploiting three deductive knowledge bases produced with the aid of experts in the field. These were coded into models by employing the selected techniques and were subsequently elicited with data gathered from humans. The inferences produced by these models were in turn analysed according to common metrics of evaluation in the field of mental workload, in specific validity and sensitivity. Findings suggest that the variance of the inferences of expert systems and fuzzy reasoning models was higher, highlighting poor stability. Contrarily, that of argument-based models was lower, showing a superior stability of its inferences across knowledge bases and under different system configurations. The originality of this research lies in the quantification of the impact of defeasible argumentation. It contributes to the field of logic and non-monotonic reasoning by situating defeasible argumentation among similar approaches of non-monotonic reasoning under uncertainty through a novel empirical comparison.",

      "abstract": "A range of formal models of human reasoning have been proposed in a number of fields such as philosophy, logic, artificial intelligence, computer science, psychology, cognitive science, etc.: various logics (epistemic logics; non\u2010monotonic logics), probabilistic systems (most notably, but not exclusively, Bayesian probability theory), belief revision systems, neural networks, among others. Now, it seems reasonable to require that formal models of human reasoning be (minimally) empirically adequate if they are to be viewed as models of the phenomena in question. How are formal models of human reasoning typically put to empirical test? One way to do so is to isolate a number of key principles of the system, and design experiments to gauge the extent to which participants do or do not follow them in reasoning tasks. Another way is to take relevant existing results and check whether a particular formal model predicts these results. The present investigation provides an illustration of the second kind of empirical testing by comparing two formal models for reasoning \u2013 namely the non\u2010monotonic logic known as preferential logic; and a particular version of belief revision theories, screened belief revision \u2013 against the reasoning phenomenon known as belief bias in the psychology of reasoning literature: human reasoners typically seek to maintain the beliefs they already hold, and conversely to reject contradicting incoming information. The conclusion of our analysis will be that screened belief revision is more empirically adequate with respect to belief bias than preferential logic and non\u2010monotonic logics in general, as what participants seem to be doing is above all a form of belief management on the basis of background knowledge. The upshot is thus that, while it may offer valuable insights into the nature of human reasoning, preferential logic (and non\u2010monotonic logics in general) is ultimately inadequate as a formal model of the phenomena in question.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge-representation and reasoning methods have been extensively researched within Artificial Intelligence. Among these, argumentation has emerged as an ideal paradigm for inference under uncertainty with conflicting knowledge. Its value has been predominantly demonstrated via analyses of the topological structure of graphs of arguments and its formal properties. However, limited research exists on the examination and comparison of its inferential capacity in real-world modelling tasks and against other knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning methods. This study is focused on a novel comparison between defeasible argumentation and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning when applied to the representation of the ill-defined construct of human mental workload and its assessment. Different argument-based and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning models have been designed considering knowledge-bases of incremental complexity containing uncertain and conflicting information provided by a human reasoner. Findings showed how their inferences have a moderate convergent and face validity when compared respectively to those of an existing baseline instrument for mental workload assessment, and to a perception of mental workload self-reported by human participants. This confirmed how these models also reasonably represent the construct under consideration. Furthermore, argument-based models had on average a lower mean squared error against the self-reported perception of mental workload when compared to fuzzy-reasoning models and the baseline instrument. The contribution of this research is to provide scholars, interested in formalisms on knowledge-representation and non-monotonic reasoning, with a novel approach for empirically comparing their inferential capacity.",

      "abstract": "State of the art algorithms for many pattern recognition problems rely on data-driven deep network models. Training these models requires a large labeled dataset and considerable computational resources. Also, it is difficult to understand the working of these learned models, limiting their use in some critical applications. Toward addressing these limitations, our architecture draws inspiration from research in cognitive systems, and integrates the principles of commonsense logical reasoning, inductive learning, and deep learning. As a motivating example of a task that requires explainable reasoning and learning, we consider Visual Question Answering in which, given an image of a scene, the objective is to answer explanatory questions about objects in the scene, their relationships, or the outcome of executing actions on these objects. In this context, our architecture uses deep networks for extracting features from images and for generating answers to queries. Between these deep networks, it embeds components for non-monotonic logical reasoning with incomplete commonsense domain knowledge, and for decision tree induction. It also incrementally learns and reasons with previously unknown constraints governing the domain's states. We evaluated the architecture in the context of datasets of simulated and real-world images, and a simulated robot computing, executing, and providing explanatory descriptions of plans and experiences during plan execution. Experimental results indicate that in comparison with an \"end to end\" architecture of deep networks, our architecture provides better accuracy on classification problems when the training dataset is small, comparable accuracy with larger datasets, and more accurate answers to explanatory questions. Furthermore, incremental acquisition of previously unknown constraints improves the ability to answer explanatory questions, and extending non-monotonic logical reasoning to support planning and diagnostics improves the reliability and efficiency of computing and executing plans on a simulated robot.",

      "abstract": "Inferences through knowledge driven approaches have been researched extensively in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Among such approaches argumentation theory has recently shown appealing properties for inference under uncertainty and conflicting evidence. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies which examine its inferential capacity over other quantitative theories of reasoning under uncertainty with real-world knowledge-bases. This study is focused on a comparison between argumentation theory and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning when applied to modeling the construct of human mental workload (MWL). Different argument-based and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning models, aimed at inferring the MWL imposed by a selection of learning tasks, in a third-level context, have been designed. These models are built upon knowledge-bases that contain uncertain and conflicting evidence provided by human experts. An analysis of the convergent and face validity of such models has been performed. Results suggest a superior inferential capacity of argument-based models over fuzzy reasoning-based models.",

Similar to other closely related problem-solving technologies, such as SAT/SMT, QBF, Planning and Scheduling, advancements in ASP solving are assessed in competition events. In this paper, we report about the design and results of the Sixth ASP Competition, which was jointly organized by the University of Calabria (Italy), Aalto University (Finland), and the University of Genoa (Italy), in affiliation with the 13th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning. This edition maintained some of the design decisions introduced in 2014, e.g., the conception of sub-tracks, the scoring scheme, and the adherence to a fixed modeling language in order to push the adoption of the ASP-Core-2 standard. On the other hand, it featured also some novelties, like a benchmark selection stage classifying instances according to their empirical hardness, and a \"Marathon\" track where the top-performing systems are given more time for solving hard benchmarks.",

In the 4D BIM domain, geometries of building objects are large and complex making it highly impractical to represent geometries as ASP facts, unoptimised spatial reasoning can be prohibitively slow, and rounding errors in floating point arithmetic often result in logical contradictions. Our novel framework addresses these challenges by integrating a specialised geometry database, built-in spatial optimisations, and support for real arithmetic solving. We empirically evaluate our prototype software tool on two large 4D BIM models from real buildings to demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our new framework to real-world workplace hazard prevention tasks in construction safety-in-design analysis.",

      "abstract": "Stream reasoning is an emerging research area focused on providing continuous reasoning solutions for data streams. The high expressiveness of non-monotonic reasoning enables complex decision making by managing defaults, commonsense, preferences, recursion, and non-determinism, but it is computationally intensive. The exponential growth in the availability of streaming data on the Web has seriously hindered the applicability of state-of-the-art non-monotonic reasoners to be applied to streaming information in a scalable way. In this paper, we address the issue of scalability for nonmonotonic stream reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) - an expressive reasoning approach based on disjunctive logic Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics, by analyzing input dependency. We introduce an input dependency graph to represent the relationships between input events based on the structure of a given logical rule set. The input dependency graph allows us to dynamically configure the streaming window size in order to maximise the scalability of the non-monotonic reasoner. We conduct an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness and ability of our proposed approach in improving the scalability of disjunctive logic programming with ASP in dynamic environments.",

These methods require a large labeled dataset for training, which is not available in many domains. Also, it is difficult to explain the working of deep networks learned from such datasets. Towards addressing these limitations, this paper describes an architecture inspired by research in cognitive systems that integrates commonsense logical reasoning with deep learning algorithms. In the context of answering explanatory questions about scenes and the underlying classification problems, the architecture uses deep networks for processing images and for generating answers to queries. Between these deep networks, it embeds components for non-monotonic logical reasoning with incomplete commonsense domain knowledge and for decision tree induction. Experimental results show that this architecture outperforms an architecture based only on deep networks when the training dataset is small, provides comparable performance on larger datasets, and provides intuitive answers to explanatory questions.",

We present Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT)(QS), a novel approach and fully implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning \u2014 a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems \u2014 based on ASPMT. ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real non-linear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other contemporary spatial reasoning systems both within and outside the context of logic programming. ASPMT(QS) is currently the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e., addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and QS information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.",

These aim to formalise defeasibility of the traditional notion of necessity in modal logic, in particular of its different readings as action, knowledge and others in specific contexts, rather than defeasibility of conditional forms. Building on an extension of the preferential approach to modal logics, we introduce new modal osperators with which to formalise the notion of defeasible necessity and distinct possibility, and that can be used to represent expected effects, refutable knowledge, and so on. We show how KLM-style conditionals can smoothly be integrated with our richer language. We also propose a tableau calculus which is sound and complete with respect to our modal preferential semantics, and of which the computational complexity remains in the same class as that of the underlying classical modal logic.",
