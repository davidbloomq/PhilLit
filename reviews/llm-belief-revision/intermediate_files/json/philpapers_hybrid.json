We intuitively think Ronald and Herbert are disagreeing, which reveals in the fact that they are licensed to use ex\u00acpressions like no (it isn\u2019t) and nuh-uh when responding to their opponent\u2019s claim. But despite the ubiquity and significance of legal disagreement, its precise nature remains elusive. This chapter discusses what exactly is going on when two people disagree about what the law requires, and how can hybrid theory may answer this question.",
