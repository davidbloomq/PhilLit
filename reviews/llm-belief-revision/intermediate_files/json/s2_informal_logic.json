      "abstract": "Abstract I argue that Aristotle takes a \u2018natural language semantics\u2019 approach to logic, which is consistent with the general attitudes one finds in informal logic today. Although his position is complex, Aristotle emphasizes the intensional rather than the extensional side of argument evaluation. He does not take a truth-functional approach to semantics, but an approach that elucidates the illative mechanism through an understanding of natures. This comes close to what informal logicians insist on. The informal logic movement was, to a very large extent, a Canadian initiative, prominently featuring authors such as Johnson, Blair, Govier, and many others.",

      "abstract": "Informal logic aims to study arguments formulated in natural language, examine their inferential structure, and extrapolate general criteria that enable us to judge the invalidity of an argument or vice versa. It transcends its limit, which is confined to the infallibility of thought from error, and transcends it to work to overthrow false arguments. Therefore, we decided to reveal this kind of logic through the argumentative theory, which gives the possibility to evoke the domicile and contextual dimension of the subject of the argumentative process, and to highlight the role played by the Ethos, Pathos, Logos, enthymeme, and the introspection of implicit forms in the discourse, and taking into account the psychological and sociological dimensions. and the ideological background, and for this reason, one of the endeavors of this study is to analyze the inferential structure of Islamic theological discourse with analogous denominators, in which the pilgrims relied on the creed. To illustrate this, the \"Al-Aslah wa Salaah\" debate, which took place between \"Al-Jabai\" and \"Al-Ash'ari\", was chosen. by adopting a method that combines analysis and conclusion, imposed by the nature of the subject, which was among the reasons for choosing the intellectual and ideological conflict, which in a large part has become subject to purely political orientations, predicting ideological transformations of a significant degree of danger that seek to crush the constants, and to blind the insights through fallacies. Logical and dissemination on a large scale, so one of the most prominent recommendations that this study urges is to be able to use arguments and logical mechanisms to distinguish between right and wrong and protect oneself from being drawn into arguments that are formed in false and fragile logical images.",

      "abstract": "Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really\"reason\"over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/LogicBench.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In his new book, Logical Form, Andrea Iacona distinguishes between two different roles that have been ascribed to the notion of logical form: the logical role and the semantic role. These two roles entail a bifurcation of the notion of logical form. Both notions of logical form, according to Iacona, are descriptive, having to do with different features of natural language sentences. I agree that the notion of logical form bifurcates, but not that the logical role is merely descriptive. In this paper, I focus on formalization, a process by which logical form, on its logical role, is attributed to natural language sentences. According to some, formalization is a form of explication, and it involves normative, pragmatic, as well as creative aspects. I present a view by which formalization involves explicit commitments on behalf of a reasoner or an interpreter, which serve the normative grounds for the evaluation of a given text. In previous work, I proposed the framework of semantic constraints for the explication of logical consequence. Here, I extend the framework to include formalization constraints. The various constraints then serve the role of commitments. I discuss specific issues raised by Iacona concerning univocality, co-reference and equivocation, and I show how our views on these matters diverge as a result of our different starting assumptions.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I defend that logic has a normative status for reasoning. To support my argument, I question whether logic can be limited to a formal calculus that establishes relations among truth-bearers (Goldstein, 1988). Instead, I argue that logic encompasses the study of inference in ordinary language. Similarly, I challenge traditional views of reasoning that depict it as a private process of drawing inferences. Instead, I embrace perspectives that view reasoning as a social activity (Dutilh-Novaes, 2021; Godden, 2015; Kalis, 2022; Mackenzie, 1989). From these bases, I explore the concept of the natural normativity of argumentation (Gilbert, 2007; Jackson, 2019). Since argumentative practices inherently possess a normative dimension, logic aims to capture and represent the rules that govern these linguistic exchanges. Logical rules are the tools from which agents can exert normative control over argumentative practices.",

      "abstract": "The article deals with the formation and development of classical, nonclassical, informal logic and argumentation theory in the context of concepts SPOD and VUCA world. It has been established that modern formal logic (classical and non-classical) can act as a model of both SPOD world and VUCA world. It has been found that the means of classical logic, primarily the fundamental principle of twovalued, allow us to describe the SPOD world with its steady, predictable, ordinary and definite. It has been revealed that the theories of non-classical logic, in particular many-valued and modal, already provide opportunities to describe the VUCA world with its variability, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. It has been determined that the progress of informal logic and argumentation theory in the second half of the 20th century witness the transition from SPOD to the VUCA world, although at that time these acronyms had not yet been introduced.\nThe article demonstrates that the development of new approaches within the limits of logical knowledge in this period was due to two interconnected factors: requests from the educational environment for new courses that would provide tools for analyzing arguments from various areas, and increased attention to leadership in new conditions, because managers must possess critical thinking skills that allow to minimize risks in situations of the VUCA world. It has been established that the technique of critical questions is a significant achievement of informal logic and, more broadly, modern argumentation theory, which allows not only to evaluate the arguments of arguers, but also to check one\u2019s own for possible charges on their part.",

      "abstract": "Our commonplace practices of reasoning in natural languages-i.e. informal reasoning- are often believed to satisfactorily map on a formal system of logic-i.e. formal logic- which typically consists of formal syntax, formal semantics, and related proof system. Nonetheless, it then becomes significant to ask on what grounds formal logic legitimately has such relevance to informal reasoning. On one standard view, formal logic governs all rationally admissible tokens of informal reasoning. This view \u2013 either in its descriptive or normative construal - has been seriously challenged by Gilbert Harman and Peter Wason who commonly hold that formal logic has no (descriptive/normative) relevance to informal reasoning. This paper provides a critical survey of these distinct accounts, narrowing down the scope of their common thesis based on the possibility of logical pluralism. As it argues, a singular formal system of proof such as classical first-order deductive logic cannot single-handedly satisfy the standard view.",

      "abstract": "In the paper I consider the relevance criterion for argument evaluation within informal logic. I focus on the dialectical relevance concept, which is the result of dialogical interpretation of argumentation process. The research topicality is due to the lack of the relevance notion unified understanding within the contemporary argumentation theory. This notion analysis is important because relevance is one of the criteria for argument evaluation. The elimination of its interpretation`s contradictions can be the step towards to both better practical argument evaluation using and integrative relevance understanding conception. The purpose of the article is to find out the specific features of the dialectical relevance in compare with others relevance kinds. To achieve this goal I, firstly, analyzed the key characteristics of the dialogue argumentation model in the relevance perspective. Secondly, I clarify the essential features of the dialectical relevance and irrelevance. Thirdly, I provide a comparative analysis of the dialectical and premissary relevance. The methodology of this research is based on the informal logics and dialogical approaches to an argument and argumentation analysis. The novelty of the research results is the dialectical and premissary relevance notions comparison. As the result I conclude that, firstly, dialectical relevance is merely dialectical, not logical criterion of evaluation. Secondly, dialectical relevance deals with argumentation process, not with argument as a premise-conclusion relation. Thirdly, dialectical and premissary relevance have common features, as the relation to the conclusion justifying. However, the dialectical relevance specifics are its rule`s compliance, dynamic and dialectical character, and relation to the argumentation correctness.",

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.",

      "abstract": "\n Argument evaluation , one of the central problems in argumentation theory, consists in studying what makes an argument a good one. This paper proposes a formal approach to argument evaluation from the perspective of justification logic. We adopt a multi-agent setting, accepting the intuitive idea that arguments are always evaluated by someone. Two general restrictions are imposed on our analysis: non-deductive arguments are left out and the goal of argument evaluation is fixed: supporting a given proposition. Methodologically, our approach uses several existing tools borrowed from justification logic, awareness logic, doxastic logic and logics for belief dependence. We start by introducing a basic logic for argument evaluation, where a list of argumentative and doxastic notions can be expressed. Later on, we discuss how to capture the mentioned form of argument evaluation by defining a preference operator in the object language. The intuitive picture behind this definition is that, when assessing a couple of arguments, the agent puts them to a test consisting of several criteria (filters). As a result of this process, a preference relation among the evaluated arguments is established by the agent. After showing that this operator suffers a special form of logical omniscience, called preferential omniscience, we discuss how to define an explicit version of it, more suitable to deal with non-ideal agents. The present work exploits the formal notion of awareness in order to model several informal phenomena: awareness of sentences, availability of arguments and communication between agents and external sources (advisers). We discuss several extensions of the basic logic and offer completeness and decidability results for all of them.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fact verification on tabular evidence incentivizes the use of symbolic reasoning models where a logical form is constructed (e.g., a LISP-style program), providing greater verifiability than fully neural approaches. However, these logical forms typically rely on well-formed tables, restricting their use in many scenarios. An emerging symbolic reasoning paradigm for textual evidence focuses on natural logic inference, which constructs proofs by modeling set-theoretic relations between a claim and its evidence in natural language. This approach provides flexibility and transparency but is less compatible with tabular evidence since the relations do not extend to arithmetic functions. We propose a set-theoretic interpretation of numerals and arithmetic functions in the context of natural logic, enabling the integration of arithmetic expressions in deterministic proofs. We leverage large language models to generate arithmetic expressions by generating questions about salient parts of a claim which are answered by executing appropriate functions on tables. In a few-shot setting on FEVEROUS, we achieve an accuracy of 71.4, outperforming both fully neural and symbolic reasoning models by 3.4 points. When evaluated on TabFact without any further training, our method remains competitive with an accuracy lead of 0.5 points.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some informal arguments are valid, others are invalid. A core application of logic is to tell us which is which by capturing these validity facts. Philosophers and logicians have explored how well a host of logics carry out this role, familiar examples being propositional, first-order and second-order logic. Since natural language and standard logics are countable, a natural question arises: is there a countable logic guaranteed to capture the validity patterns of any language fragment? That is, is there a countable omega-universal logic? Our article philosophically motivates this question, makes it precise, and then answers it. It is a self-contained, concise sequel to \u2018Capturing Consequence\u2019 by A.C. Paseau (RSL vol. 12, 2019).",

However, in a broader sense, it means transforming a message from one form of communication to another form. Logic is an important form of communication and the ability to translate natural language into logic is important in many different \ufb01elds, in which logical reasoning and logical arguments are used. In the legal \ufb01eld, for example, judges must often reason from facts and arguments presented in natural language to logical conclusions. In this paper, toward the goal of support for this kind of reasoning with machines, we propose a method for translating natural language into logical representations using a combination of deep learning methods. Our approach contributes methodologies and insights to the development of computational methods for converting natural language into logical representations.",

But the function-argument analysis, in its original version, gives rise to several problems, among them the problem about identity with which Frege begins \u201cOn Sinn and Bedeutung.\u201d This chapter traces through the problems with the original version of the new logical language and Frege\u2019s later solutions.

However, the methodologies to design and evaluate explanation-based inference models are still poorly informed by theoretical accounts on the nature of explanation. As an attempt to provide an epistemologically grounded characterisation for XAI, this paper focuses on the scientific domain, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice on the notion of a scientific explanation. Specifically, the paper combines a detailed survey of the modern accounts of scientific explanation in Philosophy of Science with a systematic analysis of corpora of natural language explanations, clarifying the nature and function of explanatory arguments from both a top-down (categorical) and a bottom-up (corpus-based) perspective. Through a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, the presented study allows deriving the following main conclusions: (1) Explanations cannot be entirely characterised in terms of inductive or deductive arguments as their main function is to perform unification; (2) An explanation must cite causes and mechanisms that are responsible for the occurrence of the event to be explained; (3) While natural language explanations possess an intrinsic causal-mechanistic nature, they are not limited to causes and mechanisms, also accounting for pragmatic elements such as definitions, properties and taxonomic relations; (4) Patterns of unification naturally emerge in corpora of explanations even if not intentionally modelled; (5) Unification is realised through a process of abstraction, whose function is to provide the inference substrate for subsuming the event to be explained under recurring patterns and high-level regularities.",

Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains. In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs. Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy. An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models\u2019 reasoning. As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.",

Many think that something bad has happenned when truth tables, Centzen rules for natural deduction, and multiply general propositions in prenex normal form are replaced by a mixed and inchoate system of techniques which, among other things, do not easily admit of machine grading. Now the informal logic movement is certainly diverse and loose jointed, but one thing that holds it together is a strong pedagogical commitment. The fundamental task of logic in a college curriculum is to develop skills and techniques for the critical evaluation and coherent presentation of arguments. Negatively, it is held that formal logic, as it has commonly been taught, has not fulfilled this function. Of course, the disagreements here are not merely pedagogical. The philosophy of ordinary language still has its influence and, as a result, many still hold that the techniques of modern symbolic logic are inadequate to the richness / subtlety / and power of ordi nary language. Its application distorts more than it illuminates. My own view, for what it is worth / is that the methods of formal logic can be profitably used to explicate such fundamental notions as validity, logical form, tautologies, contradictions/ etc. These techniques are of little use in the direct evaluation of actual arguments beyond the simplest level of complexity.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts. However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law, users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution\u2014leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning\u2014existing approaches often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating natural language into formal logic representations.To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising three custom metrics: conversion_score, reasoning_score, and Spearman_rho_score, which collectively capture the quality of logical translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.",
