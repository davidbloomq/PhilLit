The second trick is the superimposition on the background \u201cwhite noise\u201d of neural firing of EEG-detected waves like gamma. The paper describes a method, using the Hilbert transform, of calculating the dips in energy consumption as the brain is transitioned by gamma waves. It is hypothesized that consciousness may be a spandrel, the incidental result of a neurodynamic imperative that the brain enter a maximally sensitive (in sensory terms) \u201czero power\u201d state a few times a second.",

While focusing on the period 1956-1982, this review cites both earlier and later literature and it attempts to make visible their potential relevance to today&#x27;s greatest unifying AI challenge, to wit, the design of wholly autonomous artificial agents (a.k.a.",
