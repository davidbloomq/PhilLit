      "abstract": "The problem of iterated belief revision, which concerns how rational agents modify their beliefs in response to new information over time, lies at the core of understanding rational belief change. This article examines the interplay between the following two prominent frameworks for iterated belief revision: the qualitative Darwiche and Pearl\u2019s approach (abbrev. DP approach) and the quantitative Spohn conditionalization. In particular, we prove that the DP approach is too liberal (under-constrained) to capture Spohn\u2019s conditionalization (confined to revision scenarios); hence, the former cannot be regarded as a precise qualitative counterpart of the latter. Against this background, we provide insights into the essential semantic constraints on total preorders over the possible worlds needed to strengthen the DP approach and achieve alignment with Spohn\u2019s method.",

In this work we look for a canonical representation of these epistemic states. Total preorders are not expressive enough to be used as such a canonical representation. Actually, we show that some operators can even not be represented on a countable epistemic space. Nonetheless, under a very reasonable assumption on the epistemic space, we show that OCFs (Ordinal Conditional Functions) can be considered as a canonical representation.",

Firstly, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal's operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn's conditionalization are inconsistent with (P). Lastly, we show that the DP postulates allow for more revision polices than the ones that can be captured by identifying belief states with total preorders over possible worlds, a fact implying that a preference ordering (over possible worlds) is an insufficient representation for a belief state.",

      "abstract": "Belief revision and update, two significant types of belief change, both focus on how an agent modify her beliefs in presence of new information. The most striking difference between them is that the former studies the change of beliefs in a static world while the latter concentrates on a dynamically-changing world. The famous AGM and KM postulates were proposed to capture rational belief revision and update, respectively. However, both of them are too permissive to exclude some unreasonable changes in the iteration. In response to this weakness, the DP postulates and its extensions for iterated belief revision were presented. Furthermore, Rodrigues integrated these postulates in belief update. Unfortunately, his approach does not meet the basic requirement of iterated belief update. This paper is intended to solve this problem of Rodrigues's approach. Firstly, we present a modification of the original KM postulates based on belief states. Subsequently, we migrate several well-known postulates for iterated belief revision to iterated belief update. Moreover, we provide the exact semantic characterizations based on partial preorders for each of the proposed postulates. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the above iterated postulates and the KM postulates for belief update.",

      "abstract": "Discussions of the issue of iterated belief revision are commonly accompanied by the presentation of three \u201cconcrete\u201d operators: natural, restrained and lexicographic. This raises a natural question: What is so distinctive about these three particular methods? Indeed, the common axiomatic ground for work on iterated revision, the AGM and Darwiche-Pearl postulates, leaves open a whole range of alternative proposals. In this paper, we show that it is satisfaction of an additional principle of \u201cIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives\u201d, inspired by the literature on Social Choice, that unites and sets apart our three \u201celementary\u201d revision operators. A parallel treatment of iterated belief contraction is also given, yielding a family of elementary contraction operators that includes, besides the well-known \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d operators, a new contraction operator that is related to restrained revision.",

      "abstract": "According to Boutillier, Darwiche, Pearl and others, principles for iterated revision can be characterised in terms of changing beliefs about conditionals. For iterated contraction a similar formulation is not known. This is especially because for iterated belief change the connection between revision and contraction via the Levi and Harper identity is not straightforward, and therefore, characterisation results do not transfer easily between iterated revision and contraction. In this article, we develop an axiomatisation of iterated contraction in terms of changing conditional beliefs. We prove that the new set of postulates conforms semantically to the class of operators like the ones given by Konieczny and Pino Perez for iterated contraction.",

      "abstract": "\n \n In order to properly regulate iterated belief revision, Darwiche and Pearl (1997) model belief revision as revising epistemic states by propositions. An epistemic state in their sense consists of a belief set and a set of conditional beliefs. Although the denotation of an epistemic state can be indirectly captured by a total preorder on the set of worlds, it is unclear how to directly capture the structure in terms of the beliefs and conditional beliefs it contains. In this paper, we first provide an axiomatic characterisation for epistemic states by using nine rules about beliefs and conditional beliefs, and then argue that the last two rules are too strong and should be eliminated for characterising the belief state of an agent. We call a structure which satisfies the first seven rules a general epistemic state (GEP). To provide a semantical characterisation of GEPs, we introduce a mathematical structure called belief algebra, which is in essence a certain binary relation defined on the power set of worlds.We then establish a 1-1 correspondence between GEPs and belief algebras, and show that total preorders on worlds are special cases of belief algebras. Furthermore, using the notion of belief algebras, we extend the classical iterated belief revision rules of Darwiche and Pearl to our setting of general epistemic states.\n \n",
