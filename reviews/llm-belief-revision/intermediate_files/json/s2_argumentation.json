      "abstract": "This paper presents fast and exact methods for computing the probability of an argument\u2019s acceptance using Dung\u2019s semantics in the Constellation paradigm of Abstract Argumentation. For (directed) Singly-Connected Graphs (SCGs), the problem can now be solved in linearithmic time instead of being exponential in the number of attacks, as reported in the literature. Moreover, in the more general case of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), we provide an algorithm whose time complexity is linearithmic in the product of the out-degree of dependent arguments, i.e., arguments reaching the argument considered for acceptance through multiple paths in the graph. We theoretically show that this complexity is lower than the lower bound of the (exact) Constellation method, which is also supported by empirical results. Our approach to DAGs is also compared with the (approximate) Monte-Carlo method, which is stopped when exact results are obtained. Within this time constraint, Monte-Carlo still outputs significant errors, underlying the fast computation of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been a useful tool for approximate reasoning. The encoding method is an important approach to formally model $AF$s under related semantics. The aim of this paper is to develop the encoding method from classical Dung's $AF$s ($DAF$s) to $AF$s with set attackers ($AFSA$s) including higher-level argumentation frames ($HLAF$s), Barringer's higher-order $AF$s ($BHAF$s), frameworks with sets of attacking arguments ($SETAF$s) and higher-order set $AF$s ($HSAF$s). Regarding syntactic structures, we propose the $HSAF$s where the target of an attack is either an argument or an attack and the sources are sets of arguments and attacks. Regarding semantics, we translate $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s under respective complete semantics to {\\L}ukasiewicz's 3-valued propositional logic system ($PL_3^L$). Furthermore, we propose complete semantics of $BHAF$s and $HSAF$s by respectively generalizing from $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s, and then translate to the $PL_3^L$. Moreover, for numerical semantics of $AFSA$s, we propose the equational semantics and translate to fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}$s). This paper establishes relationships of model equivalence between an $AFSA$ under a given semantics and the encoded formula in a related propositional logic system ($PLS$). By connections of $AFSA$s and $PLS$s, this paper provides the logical foundations for $AFSA$s associated with complete semantics and equational semantics. The results advance the argumentation theory by unifying $HOAF$s and $SETAF$s under logical formalisms, paving the way for automated reasoning tools in AI, decision support, and multi-agent systems.",

It has been extended in several directions, including the possibility to express supports, leading to the development of the Bipolar Argumentation Framework (BAF), and recursive attacks and supports, resulting in the Recursive BAF (Rec-BAF). Different interpretations of supports have been proposed, whereas for Rec-BAF (where the target of attacks and supports may also be attacks and supports) even different semantics for attacks have been defined. However, the semantics of these frameworks have either not been defined in the presence of support cycles or are often quite intricate in terms of the involved definitions. We encompass this limitation and present classical semantics for general BAF and Rec-BAF and show that the semantics for specific BAF and Rec-BAF frameworks can be defined by very simple and intuitive modifications of that defined for the case of AF. This is achieved by providing a modular definition of the sets of defeated and acceptable elements for each AF-based framework. We also characterize, in an elegant and uniform way, the semantics of general BAF and Rec-BAF in terms of logic programming and partial stable model semantics.",

      "abstract": "Argumentation is an important research area in the field of AI. There is a substantial amount of work on different aspects of Dung's abstract Argumentation Framework (AF). Two relevant aspects considered separately so far are: i) extending the framework to account for recursive attacks and supports, and ii) considering dynamics, i.e., AFs evolving over time. In this paper, we jointly deal with these two aspects. We focus on High-Order Argumentation Frameworks with Necessities (HOAFNs) which allow for attack and support relations (interpreted as necessity) not only between arguments but also targeting attacks and supports at any level. We propose an approach for the incremental evaluation of the credulous acceptance problem in HOAFNs, by \u201cincrementally\u201d computing an extension (a set of accepted arguments, attacks and supports), if it exists, containing a given goal element in an updated HOAFN. In particular, we are interested in monitoring the credulous acceptance of a given argument, attack or support (goal) in an evolving HOAFN. Thus, our approach assumes to have a HOAFN \u0394, a goal \u03f1 occurring in \u0394, an extension E for \u0394 containing \u03f1, and an update u establishing some changes in the original HOAFN, and uses the extension for first checking whether the update is relevant; for relevant updates, an extension of the updated HOAFN containing the goal is computed by translating the problem to the AF domain and leveraging on AF solvers. We provide formal results for our incremental approach and empirically show that it outperforms the evaluation from scratch of the credulous acceptance problem for an updated HOAFN.",

We discuss how the notion of completion of IAFs can be adapted to take into account the nature of the support relation, providing a couple of alternative definitions. After that, we analyse the impact of choosing among these alternatives on the complexity of argument acceptability problems.

Intell. , 228, 321\u2013357), enabled a new way of reasoning with arguments, which does not take into account the internal structure of arguments but only how they are related to each other. The only form of relation considered in AAFs is a binary attack relation on the set of arguments. From the definitions of acceptability semantics of AAFs, it is obvious that attacks actually have a dual role: on the one hand, they generate conflicts; on the other hand, they can defend other arguments from attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework, where the modeller can explicitly specify the role of each attack. For this purpose, we define a set of conflict-generating attacks R C and a set of defending attacks R d , as well as a family of semantics that considers the role of each attack while determining which arguments are attacked, which are defended and which will be included in each extension. We study the formal properties of the proposed framework and semantics, show that our framework is a generalization of AAFs and assess its semantics against a set of principles. Finally, we present a web application that provides an interface for creating custom argumentation frameworks and uses ASP to compute their extensions.",

A RAF is composed of a set of arguments and of a binary relation which models the attacks as in Dung's seminal argumentation framework. The main difference between Dung's framework and a RAF is the fact that a RAF is able to take into account higher-order interactions (i.e. an attack can target an attack and not only an argument). This kind of framework is recent enough for an efficient computation of its main semantics to remain an open question. In this paper, we propose one of the first algorithms dedicated to this issue, RAFDivider. We prove its soundness and its completeness.",

Consequently, the term strong equivalence was coined in the literature and thoroughly investigated. In the present paper, the knowledge representation formalism under consideration are claim-augmented argumentation frameworks (CAFs) which provide a formal basis to analyze conclusion-oriented problems in argumentation by adapting a claim-focused perspective. CAFs extend Dung AFs by associating a claim to each argument representing its conclusion. In this paper, we investigate both ordinary and strong equivalence in CAFs. Thereby, we take the fact into account that one might either be interested in the actual arguments or their claims only. The former point of view naturally yields an extension of strong equivalence for AFs to the claim-based setting while the latter gives rise to a novel equivalence notion which is genuine for CAFs. We tailor, examine and compare these notions and obtain a comprehensive study of this matter for CAFs. We conclude by investigating the computational complexity of naturally arising decision problems.",

Compared to traditional methods like pseudo-code descriptions, abstract solvers have several advantages. In particular, they provide a uniform formal representation that allows for precise comparisons of different algorithms. Recently, this new methodology has proven successful in declarative paradigms such as Propositional Satisfiability and Answer Set Programming. In this paper, we apply this machinery to Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation frameworks. We first provide descriptions of several advanced algorithms for the preferred semantics in terms of abstract solvers. We also show how it is possible to obtain new abstract solutions by \u201ccombining\u201d concepts of existing algorithms by means of combining abstract solvers. Then, we implemented a new solving procedure based on our findings in cegartix, and call it cegartix+. We finally show that cegartix+ is competitive and complementary in its performance to cegartix on benchmarks of the first and second argumentation competition.",

      "abstract": "Claim-augmented argumentation frameworks (CAFs) provide a formal basis to analyze conclusion-oriented problems in argumentation by adapting a claim-focused perspective; they extend Dung AFs by associating a claim to each argument representing its conclusion. This additional layer offers various possibilities to generalize abstract argumentation semantics as the re-interpretation of arguments in terms of their claims can be performed at different stages in the evaluation of the framework: One approach is to perform the evaluation entirely at argument-level before interpreting arguments by their claims (inherited semantics); alternatively, one can perform certain steps in the process (e.g., maximization) already in terms of the arguments\u2019 claims (claim-level semantics). The inherent difference of these approaches not only potentially results in different outcomes but, as we will show in this paper, is also mirrored in terms of computational complexity. To this end, we provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of the four main reasoning problems with respect to claim-level variants of preferred, naive, stable, semi-stable and stage semantics and complete the complexity results of inherited semantics by providing corresponding results for semi-stable and stage semantics. Moreover, we show that deciding, whether for a given framework the two approaches of a semantics coincide (concurrence) can be surprisingly hard, ranging up to the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.",

We start by showing that the preservation results of Dung\u2019s admissibility, graded admissibility and strong admissibility during the aggregation of extensions are negative. To overcome such negative results, we define a model for extension aggregation that clearly separates the constraint supposed to be satisfied by individuals and the constraint that must be met by the collective decision. Using this model, we show that the majority rule guarantees admissible sets on profiles that satisfy a variant of Dung\u2019s admissibility, as well as profiles of extensions with some specific characteristics.",

As with logical statements, an argument applies to specific objects in the universe or relations among them, and may have exceptions. In this paper, we propose\n\nan argumentation formalism that allows associating arguments with a domain of application. Appropriate semantics are given, which formalise the notion of partial argument acceptance, i.e. the set of objects or relations that an argument can be applied\n\nto. We show that our proposal is in fact equivalent to the standard Argumentation Frameworks of Dung, but allows a more intuitive and compact expression of some core concepts of commonsense and non-monotonic reasoning, such as the scope of an argument, exceptions, relevance and others.",
