We close the paper by noting that these operators satisfy iterated versions of many AGM era postulates, including Superexpansion, that are not sound for admissible operators in general.",

A parallel treatment of iterated belief contraction is also given, yielding a family of elementary contraction operators that includes, besides the well-known \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d operators, a new contraction operator that is related to restrained revision.",
