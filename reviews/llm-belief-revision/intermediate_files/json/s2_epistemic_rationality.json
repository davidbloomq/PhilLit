Some have thought that this familiar observation supports the idea that there are diachronic norms of epistemic rationality \u2013 namely, norms of good reasoning. Partly drawing upon Carroll's story of Achilles and the Tortoise, this article criticises this line of thought on the grounds that it rests on a mistaken conception of inference.",

      "abstract": "The study of defeasible reasoning unites epistemologists with those working in AI, in part, because both are interested in epistemic rationality. While it is traditionally thought to govern the formation and (with)holding of beliefs, epistemic rationality may also apply to the interrogative attitudes associated with our core epistemic practice of inquiry, such as wondering, investigating, and curiosity. Since generally intelligent systems should be capable of rational inquiry, AI researchers have a natural interest in the norms that govern interrogative attitudes. Following its recent coinage, we use the term \"zetetic\" to refer to the properties and norms associated with the capacity to inquire. In this paper, we argue that zetetic norms can be modeled via defeasible inferences to and from questions---a.k.a erotetic inferences---in a manner similar to the way norms of epistemic rationality are represented by defeasible inference rules. We offer a sequent calculus that accommodates the unique features of \"erotetic defeat\" and that exhibits the computational properties needed to inform the design of zetetic agents. The calculus presented here is an improved version of the one presented in Millson (2019), extended to cover a new class of defeasible erotetic inferences.",

      "abstract": "Epistemology has recently taken a zetetic turn: a shift in emphasis from the study of norms of belief to norms of inquiry. In this paper, I argue that a non-ideal approach to zetetic normativity can provide norms of inquiry for bounded, psychologically realistic agents. I introduce the concepts of non-ideal epistemology and bounded epistemic rationality and provide a brief overview of inquiry epistemology. I continue with proposing some features that should be included in the norms of inquiry for bounded agents. I argue that such norms should recognize our cognitive, environmental, and practical limitations. They should direct bounded agents to inquire about relevant problems, and they should be satisficing in nature, meaning that they allow for good enough reaching of epistemic goals. I argue that rational inquiry is not determined by a priori normative criteria, but is defined as the fit of the strategy with the environment. Inquiry epistemology for bounded agents should provide concrete, fine-grained zetetic norms that are achievable for ordinary inquirers and can serve as epistemic guidance. The study of norms of inquiry for bounded agents explores both normative and descriptive parts of inquiry, is ameliorative, partly empirical, and requires collaboration between philosophy and empirical disciplines such as psychology and cognitive science.",

This paper critically examines whether SEI can explain the categorical (unconditional) authority of epistemic norms. While SEI effectively illustrates how social enforcement of truth-conducive norms constrains agents practically, it faces three vulnerabilities needing explicit attention. First, SEI ties epistemic obligations to communal participation, potentially allowing agents to evade these norms by disconnecting from their community. Second, it permits epistemic free riders\u2014those benefiting from others\u2019 truth-seeking without personally adhering to epistemic norms. Third, anchoring normativity solely in social utility risks epistemic relativism, lacking an objective standard to evaluate differing communities\u2019 rational inquiry practices. To address these issues, I propose a novel theoretical refinement called \u201cTruth-augmented SEI,\u201d integrating truth as an intrinsic epistemic goal. This preserves SEI\u2019s core insight into social mechanisms supporting epistemic norms, yet recognizes truth itself as the ultimate epistemic aim, thus maintaining normative authority even for isolated individuals or truth-indifferent communities.",

I illustrate the contrast between philosophy as a normative discipline and psychology as the empirical study of cognition and show that unattainable standards and the arbitration problem pose a challenge for normative theories of rationality. I then outline three possible types of relations between normative and descriptive theories of rationality, the third being the proposal for hybrid concepts, such as bounded epistemic rationality, that include both normative and descriptive elements. I continue by describing Herbert Simon\u2019s notion of bounded rationality and Gerd Gigerenzer\u2019s ecological rationality, and consider the role of bounded rationality in epistemology. I reflect on the relationship between norms of epistemic and bounded rationality and finally, drawing on the work of David Thorstad, I suggest some features that I believe should be included in an account of bounded epistemic rationality. I aim to show that an understanding of epistemic rationality that is compatible with bounded rationality can help to avoid overly strict, idealized, as-if theories of rationality, narrow the gap between the normative and the descriptive, and bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of epistemic rationality.",

      "abstract": "What is the rational response to a scientific disagreement? Many epistemologists argue that disagreement with an epistemic peer should generally lead to conciliation by lowering confidence in the disputed belief or even suspending judgment altogether. Although this conciliatory approach is widely regarded as a norm of individual rationality, its value in the context of collective scientific inquiry is less clear. Some have even raised concerns that conciliating in scientific disagreements may slow progress or reduce the efficiency of inquiry. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-based model that captures key aspects of scientific disagreement by incorporating both epistemic norms, which govern belief revision, and zetetic norms, which guide how scientists pursue inquiry. Our results indicate that the effects of conciliating in the face of disagreement\u2014whether detrimental or beneficial\u2014depend on the zetetic norms that scientists follow. When they focus on exploiting the hypothesis that they believe is most likely to succeed, remaining steadfast is more effective. However, with exploratory scientists, conciliation does not negatively affect group performance. These findings highlight the critical role of zetetic norms in determining the rational response to disagreement in scientific practice.",

In this paper, I first consider some seemingly promising versions of the positive evidential requirement to form beliefs in accordance with your evidence and argue that they either fail to avoid the problem of pointlessness or fail to bind you independently of practical requirements. I then show that even the negative requirement not to believe against your evidence falls prey to the same problem: either it enjoins pointlessness or its binding force depends essentially on practical norms. This is puzzling, as our epistemic practice seems to presuppose evidential standards that are independent of practical rationality. I suggest that the alleged evidential \u201cnorms\u201d are evaluative \u2018ought\u2019-statements about what it would be epistemically ideal for you to do, which, on their own, do not issue any genuine prescriptions or demands.",

      "abstract": "Consideration of collectives raises important questions about human rationality. This has long been known for questions about preferences, but it holds also with respect to beliefs. For one, there are contexts (such as voting) where we might care as much, or more, about the rationality of a collective than the rationality of the individuals it comprises. Here, a given standard may yield competing assessments at the individual and the collective level, thus giving rise to important normative questions. At the same time, seemingly rational strategies of individuals may have surprising consequences, or even fail, when exercised by individuals within collectives. This paper will illustrate these considerations with examples, provide an overview of different formal frameworks for understanding and assessing the beliefs of collectives, and it will illustrate how such frameworks can combine with simulations in order to elucidate epistemic\u00a0norms.",

We also introduce a sequent calculus that is sound and complete with respect to both approaches. We compare both accounts, and finally, we suggest that the plurality of Strong Kleene logic as well as the general framework 6SK are linked to formal epistemic norms via bridge principles.",

Although Sarah Stroud and Simon Keller argue that friendships sometimes require bad epistemic agency, their proposals do not go far enough. I argue here for a more radical claim\u2014romantic love sometimes requires we form beliefs that are false. Lovers stand in a special position with one another; they owe things to one another that they do not owe to others. Such demands hold for beliefs as well. Two facets of love ground what I call the false belief requirement , or the demand to form false beliefs when it is for the good of the beloved: the demand to love for the right reasons and the demand to refrain from doxastic wronging. Since truth is indispensable to epistemic rationality, the requirement to believe falsely, consequently, undermines truth norms. I demonstrate that, when the false belief requirement obtains, there is an irreconcilable conflict between love and truth norms of epistemic rationality: we must forsake one, at least at the time, for the other.",

      "abstract": "Epistemic nihilism for inquiry is the claim that there are no epistemic norms of inquiry. Epistemic nihilism was once the received stance towards inquiry, and I argue that it should be taken seriously again. My argument is that the same considerations which led us away from epistemic nihilism in the case of belief not only cannot refute epistemic nihilism for inquiry, but in fact may well support it. These include the argument from non-existence that there are no non-epistemic reasons for belief; the linguistic argument that epistemic norms of belief are needed to capture the semantics of ordinary epistemic talk; and the argument from theoretical roles that epistemic norms are needed to play key theoretical roles for rational belief. I conclude by sketching an alternative Gibbardian picture on which norms of inquiry are all-things-considered norms governing action.",

      "abstract": "A theory of rational state transition must answer four questions: are shifts within its domain brought about by agents or do they simply happen to them? Is the approach part a theory\u2019s dynamics or kinematics? Does the approach make use of everyday or ideal rationality? Are the mental states involved coarse- or fine-grained? The questions are used to generate a sixteen-fold classification of rational shift-in-view. It is then argued that rational inference leads to the idea of a coordinated epistemic reason: roughly, a reason where causal-efficacy and evidential-relevance fuse together. This idea is illustrated with everyday examples and it is then argued that the theory of rational inference turns crucially on the non-ideal rationality of agential dynamics. The chapter closes by developing a theory of rational inference and a take on the human mind to go with it.",

A familiar human limitation is our tendency to lose information. How should we compensate for this tendency? The Seeping Beauty problem allows us to isolate this question, without the confounding influence of other human limitations. If the coin lands tails, Beauty can't preserve whatever information she has received on Monday: she is bound to violate the norms of ideal diachronic rationality. The considerations that support these norms, however, can still be used. I investigate how Beauty should update her beliefs so as to maximize the expected accuracy of her new beliefs. The investigation draws attention to important but neglected questions about the connection between rational belief and evidential support, about the status of ideal and non\u2010ideal norms, about the dependence of epistemic norms on descriptive facts, and about the precise formulation of expected accuracy measures. It also sheds light on the puzzle of higher\u2010order evidence.",

My aim in this paper is to unify and explain recently proposed norms of inquiry by developing a general account of the conditions under which inquiries are rational, analogous to theories such as evidentialism and reliabilism for rational belief. I begin with a reason-responsiveness conception of rationality as responding correctly to possessed normative reasons. I extend this account with a series of claims about the normative reasons for inquiry that we possess. I apply the account to shed light on two classes of norms that have featured prominently in recent discussions: norms of clutter avoidance forbidding agents from engaging in trivial inquiries, and norms of logical non-omniscience governing properties such as the deductive closure and consistency of an agent's belief state. I conclude with a discussion of the sense in which norms of inquiry should be regarded as epistemic norms.",

While extreme subjective Bayesians think that the coherence norm is the only requirement of epistemic rationality, more moderate proponents defend further requirements, such as versions of the Indifference Principle or the Principal Principle. This raises the question of how we can measure approximations to rationality, when being ideally rational requires thinkers to comply with multiple different epistemic norms. Different approaches to justifying norms of rationality are distinguished by whether they assume that there is a single epistemic value or good that explains the various requirements of rationality, or whether there are multiple epistemic values or goods that have to be aggregated somehow in evaluating the rationality of epistemic states. Each view of how epistemic values give rise to norms of rationality is then paired with a suitable strategy for measuring approximations to ideal rationality.",

Arationalists hold that propaganda is constitutively reliant on bypassing audience-side rationality. According to the twin pillars of arationalism, then, propaganda is distinguished by the arationalism of audience-side uptake, and criticizable for its circumvention of audience-side rationality. Here, I argue that if the twin pillars of arationalism hold, then arationalists must either deny that bald-faced propaganda is propaganda or deny that bald-faced propaganda is objectionable qua propaganda. Against arationalism, I argue that propagandizing is apt to epistemically infringe on an audience. Propagandizing constitutively involves the systematic contravention of the norms typifying the relationship between communicator and audience, with the characteristic effect of eroding the audience's epistemic agency. The epistemic harm of propaganda is that it has the power to alienate its audience from itself both epistemically and politically by illegitimately constraining what is epistemically possible for its audience.",

My argument thus corroborates and builds upon recent work suggesting that the problems of epistemic injustice are relevant to, but largely ignored in, Brandom\u2019s project. In short, I contend that Brandom\u2019s theory of discursive normativity, where norms and novelty depend on a particular understanding of the space of reasons, does not provide the necessary theoretical tools to understand the historical exclusion of women from that space, or to explain how they have gained or might gain access to it.",

      "abstract": "This paper connects veritistic teleological epistemology, VTE, with the epistemological dimension of the scientific realism debate. VTE sees our epistemic activities as a tradeoff between believing truths and avoiding error. I argue that van Fraassen\u2019s epistemology is not suited to give a justification for a crucial presupposition of his Bad Lot objection to inference to the best explanation (IBE), the presupposition that believing that p is linked to p being more likely to be true. This makes him vulnerable to a counterargument, tailored after Musgrave\u2019s defense of IBE, which would result in a stalemate between them about presuppositions of rationality. I will, however, show that switching to VTE can justify van Fraassen\u2019s presupposition. This leads to a dismissal of common IBE arguments for realism as presented by Boyd and Musgrave, but I also argue that a more cautious version of realism can be rescued from the Bad Lot objection. Finally, I raise some worries about epistemic risk-attitude consistency for constructive empiricists and develop an alternative anti-realist position.1",

      "abstract": "Ideally, we would have beliefs that satisfy norms of truth and rationality, as well as fostering the acquisition, retention and use of other relevant information. In reality, we have limited cognitive capacities and are subject to motivational biases on an everyday basis, and may also experience impairments in perception, memory, learning, and reasoning in the course of our lives. Such limitations and impairments give rise to distorted memory beliefs, confabulated explanations, elaborated delusional beliefs, motivated delusional beliefs, and optimistically biased beliefs. In the book, Bortolotti argues that some irrational beliefs qualify as epistemically innocent, where the notion of epistemic innocence captures the fact that in some contexts the adoption, maintenance or reporting of the beliefs delivers significant epistemic benefits that could not be easily attained otherwise. Epistemic innocence is a weaker notion than epistemic justification, as it does not imply that the epistemic benefits of the irrational belief outweigh its epistemic costs. However, it clarifies the relationship between the epistemic and psychological effects of irrational beliefs on agency. It is misleading to assume that epistemic rationality and psychological adaptiveness always go hand-in-hand, but also that there is a straight-forward trade off between them. Rather, epistemic irrationality can lead to psychological adaptiveness and psychological adaptiveness in turn can support the attainment of epistemic goals. Recognising the circumstances in which irrational beliefs enhance or restore epistemic performance informs our mutual interactions and enables us to take measures to reduce their irrationality without undermining the conditions for epistemic success.",

      "abstract": "The disclosed results of this fundamental interdisciplinary study are centred around the main super-task \u2013 to create improved, more detailed and enriched by attributive features, versions of the four fundamental types of scientific rationality \u2013 classical, postclassical, non-classical and post-nonclassical, as well as in this target context to argue their emergence as a result of a particular scientific revolution, the optimal set of attributes-characteristics, the complexity of the content and formulations of the topic, objective, object and subject as fundamental methodological parameters of the search and a certain connection of each type with the most influential scientific and philosophical views/approaches today. The object of the reflexive study is quite logically the types of rationality in the evolution of New European science in their quaternary development-transformation from relatively simple forms and organisations (classical and postclassical) to increasingly complex, synergistic and human-dimensional (non-classical and postnonclassical) and in their synchronous cultural and historical dependence on the content and consequences of the four universally recognised scientific revolutions, and its subject is the methodological optics of classical, postclassical, non-classical and postnonclassical types of rationality in their four-stage evolutionary synthesis and metasystemic complementarity, which finds epistemological confirmation both in the complication of the main parameters of professionally carried out research (first of all, its topic, objective, object, subject) and in the methodological justification of the otherness of scientific and philosophical approaches. At the same time, the application of the author\u2019s meta-optics to solving a number of methodological problems of the current study made it possible to consistently constructively address four t a s k s that fully specify its reflected objective. To begin with, it is proved on the basis of different analytical and epistemic material that the consequences of each of the four scientific revolutions since the seventeenth century were the establishment of a significantly renewed t y p e of rationality, each time resulting in changes in ideals and norms, methods and means, methodological optics and scientific pictures of the world. In this research perspective, it is argued that the integral outcome of the Second Scientific Revolution (from about the middle of the nineteenth century) was the emergence of a modernised type of rationality, which we call postclassical; in fact, by most attributive features, it no longer belongs to the classical one and at the same time does not yet constitute a non-classical science. Furthermore, it is comprehensively reasoned and demonstrated that the second author\u2019s versions of methodological optics of classical, non-classical and post-nonclassical types of rationality, in addition to the original version of the post-classical science methodology, model and semiotically contain the optimal minimum of attributive features (12, 14, 16, and 18, respectively), which capaciously and logically reflect in each of the four invariants a relatively complete holistic picture of a certain relevant ontological reality, which is manifested by cultural means as an increasing complexity of verified intelligence in the evolutionary and revolutionary stages of development of New European science; it is significant that only in the newest (post-nonclassical) type of rationality the researcher\u2019s personality and their thought-reflective activity are involved in the very process of constructing/creating a highly complex object as its key self-development factor, which makes it possible to obtain reliable rational-humanistic knowledge. Thirdly, the author reveals the multi-causal influence of the complication of the architectonics of methodological optics of the main types of rationality on the change of the fundamental parameters of scientific research, primarily on the choice of topic, the definition of its purpose and especially the object and subject, which have not so much a theoretical load as an original methodological purpose; in this problematic context, it is established that there is a clear tendency and even a pattern of complication of these most important features of cognitive search in terms of volume, structure, content and conceptual and categorical qualities. first of all, it is convincingly shown that classical science studies isolated simple objects and their mono-subject definitions, creating a mechanistic picture of the world, post-classical science studies more complex natural and technical objects as separate systems and their subject structures, developing a natural-scientific picture of the world, non-classical science studies theoretically constructed objects as complex self-regulating model-systems and invariant subject schemes, that constitute the centre and organise research thought activity, and together produce a single multidisciplinary picture of the world; postnonclassical \u2013 exclusively supercomplex (human-dimensional) objects as self-developing, open and synergistic, mega-systems, which include the researcher himself, and various subject fields of creation of such objects, which makes it possible to build an appropriate \u2013 anthropological, synergistic, vita-cultural \u2013 integral picture of the world. Finally, from a super-reflexive position, the author argues for a methodological map of the study of the alternative scientific approach and the philosophical approach as the most fundamental ways of human/conscious vision of the world in terms of a number of essential features, principles, thought patterns, category garlands, definitions in their multivariate embodiment in contemporary intellectual life; it is emphasised that the acquisition by each of them of the status of methodological requires a radical change in the perspective of consideration of the sphere of reality of cognitive creativity, namely, existentially complete elaboration of methods and means, norms and procedures for the implementation of thought activity on any subject of the object or problematic and worldview plan, and in the dialectical interpenetration of the resources of the world of methodology and the instrumental capabilities of the field of methodology; finally, against the background of characterising a number of the most obvious aspects of this opposition, it is generalised that each of the three general approaches \u2013 scientific, philosophical, methodological \u2013 always has one of two ways of historical development: top-down, i.e., degeneration into a disciplinary subject of study, or bottom-up, i.e., development into a fundamental metatheory.",
