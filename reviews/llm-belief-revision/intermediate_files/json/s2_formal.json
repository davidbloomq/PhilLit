      "abstract": "This paper attempts to reconcile the claims that the mind is both flat (Chater, 2018) and highly rational (Oaksford & Chater, 2020). According to the flat mind hypothesis, the mind is a mass of inconsistent and contradictory fragments of experience. However, standard accounts of rationality from formal epistemology argue that to be rational, our beliefs must be consistent, and we must believe all the logical consequences of our beliefs. A social account of rationality is developed based on Brandom's (1994) logical expressivism, in which respecting the norms of logic and probability theory is still central but where these standards apply to our public commitments in social dialogical contexts rather than to our individual belief systems (Skovgaard-Olsen, 2017). According to this account, even if someone's individual beliefs are inconsistent, they cannot be condemned as irrational if they acknowledge the inconsistency and seek to resolve it. It is shown how this approach interacts with people's fragmented and shallow world knowledge, and its social distribution yields some counterintuitive consequences, such as it sometimes being rational individually not seeking to resolve contradictions. Other consequences of this social expressivist approach are considered, including for dual process theories of reasoning, our view of beliefs, the status of logic, and Fodor's (1983) view of central systems. It is concluded that people can have flat minds and yet be highly rational.",

The views are challenged on various counts, especially by the proponents of the so-called narrative approach, on which the fact-finders' decision is the result of a dynamic interplay between competing narratives of what happened.

The traditional requirement of probabilistic coherence presupposes that you have precise credences, for instance, and it says that your precise credence function must satisfy the probability axioms. The traditional rule for updating says that when you get evidence, you should modify your precise credence function by conditionalizing it on the information that you learn. Meanwhile, advocates of imprecise credences challenge the assumption behind these rules. They argue that your partial beliefs are best represented not by a single function, but by a set of functions, or representor.2 The move to imprecise credences leaves many traditional requirements of rationality surprisingly intact, as fans of imprecise credences often simply reinterpret these rules as applying to the individual functions in your representor. In order for your imprecise credences to be rational, each member of your representor must satisfy the probability axioms. In order for you to update rationally, your later representor must contain just those functions that result from conditionalizing each member of your representor on the information you learn.3 However, for agents with imprecise credences, the requirements of rationality needn\u2019t take this form. Whether you are rational might just as easily depend on global",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Given the success of the formal approach, within contemporary epistemology, to understanding degreed belief, some philosophers have recently considered its extension to the challenge of understanding intention. According to them, (1) intentions can also admit of degrees, as beliefs do, and (2) these degreed states are all governed by the norms of the probability calculus, such that the rational norms for belief and for intention exhibit certain structural similarity. This paper, however, raises some worries about (2). It considers two schemes for representing degreed intention, and casts some doubt on applying probabilistic norms to degreed intention on each scheme. And it argues that the norms of Intention\u2013Belief Consistency and Enkrasia cannot plausibly be turned into norms prescribing a simple correspondence relation between one\u2019s degrees of belief and intention. The results suggest a potential structural discrepancy between the norms of theoretical and practical rationality\u2014at least for degreed belief and intention. This potential discrepancy not only raises interesting questions about the intention\u2013belief relation and rational norms for degreed intention. It also poses a new challenge for intention-based expressivism about normative judgment and cognitivism about practical rationality.",

They have emerged in such diverse fields as domain theory [1, 16], formal learning theory [18], epistemology and philosophy of science [10, 15, 8, 9, 2], statistics [6, 7] and modal logic [17, 4]. In those applications, open sets are typically interpreted as hypotheses deductively verifiable by true propositional information that rules out relevant possibilities. However, in statistical data analysis, one routinely receives random samples logically compatible with every statistical hypothesis. We bridge the gap between propositional and statistical data by solving for the unique topology on probability measures in which the open sets are exactly the statistically verifiable hypotheses. Furthermore, we extend that result to a topological characterization of learnability in the limit from statistical data.",

      "abstract": "It is certainly well accepted that formal models play a key role in scientific job. Its use goes from natural sciences like physics and even to social sciences like economics and politics. Using mathematics allows the researcher to consider more complicated scenarios involving several variables. Some models are developed to make predictions, others to describe a phenomena, or just to improve the explanation of events in the world. But what has all this to do with philosophy? The aim of the present paper is to investigate debates on the role of formal models in a specific philosophical subject, precisely, the epistemology of rationality. Are we able to explain why models are needed in epistemological work? This answer will be addressed on the assumptions that epistemological theorizing is committed with normative statements. More specifically, epistemologists are concerned with normative questions about what rationality requires from epistemic agents. The first goal is to discuss some assumptions about the role of mathematical models in formal epistemology undertaking. And secondly, I will argue for the following two claims: (i) formal models are useful tools for predicting consequences of normative assumption about what is intuitively required by rationality; and (ii) insofar rationality theory is normative in virtue of being instrumentalist and aiming at truth, formal models are means-end tools, therefore, for rationality, mathematical models are devices for maximizing truth in doxastic states.\n\u00a0",

This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient integrity across dynamic scientific domains.",

      "abstract": "Formal epistemology is rapidly growing in depth and breadth in recent years. Formal epistemology devises and polishes an increasing number of formal resources that model and regulate our epistemic judgments and practice, resulting in its extension in depth. Formal epistemology also applies those resources to an increasingly broader range of epistemological problems, resulting in its extension in width. Shogenji\u2019s book contributes to further extending the depth and breadth of formal epistemology. No serious attempt has yet been made in formal epistemology to deal with the traditional problem of Cartesian skepticism. Shogenji, in the Introduction, declares that the book is meant to fill this lacuna, that is, to respond to the problem of Cartesian skepticism with the best resources in formal epistemology. The book has seven chapters. In Chapter 1, Shogenji characterizes the project of the book as a version of meliorative social epistemology. Meliorative epistemology, as he characterizes it, aims to guide our epistemic judgments and practice in the pursuit of the two alethic goals of cognition: the qualitative alethic goal of increasing true beliefs and avoiding false beliefs and the quantitative alethic goal of making the probability as close to the true value as possible. Interestingly, Shogenji claims that the appeal to intuition has no place in his version of meliorative epistemology, except in the context of discovery. Shogenji\u2019s meliorative epistemology proceeds by making full avail of the best empirical evidence and the best conceptual tools\u2014most prominently, formal results in probability theory and statistical learning theory\u2014that are available to the relevant epistemic community. Shogenji, in Chapter 2, defends a correspondence theory of truth, according to which beliefs and statements are true if and only if they represent reality in the way it actually is. Cartesian skepticism presents one or another skeptical hypothesis\u2014e.g., the brain-in-a-vat (BIV) hypothesis or the evil genius hypothesis\u2014 that the objects of our sense perception are illusions created by a super scientist or a malicious omnipotent being and they are merely entities in the virtual world. The skeptical hypotheses are alternatives to the natural world hypothesis that the object of our perceptions are",

      "abstract": "Abstract A Lockean metaphysics of belief that understands outright belief as a determinable with degrees of confidence as determinates is supposed to effect a unification of traditional coarse-grained epistemology of belief with fine-grained epistemology of confidence. But determination of belief by confidence would not by itself yield the result that norms for confidence carry over to norms for outright belief unless belief and high confidence are token identical. We argue that this token-identity thesis is incompatible with the neglected phenomenon of \u201cmistuned knowledge\u201d \u2013 knowledge in the absence of rational confidence. We show how partial epistemological unification can be secured, even without token identity, given determination of outright belief by degrees of confidence. Finally, we suggest a direction for the pursuit of thoroughgoing epistemological unification.",

The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that there are common scenarios in which Bayesian conditionalization is less rational\u2014both from an ecological and an internal perspective\u2014than other theoretically well-motivated belief updating strategies, even in very simple situations and even for an \u201cideal\u201d agent who is computationally unbounded. The examples also serve to demarcate the narrow conditions under which Bayesian conditionalization is guaranteed to be ecologically optimal. A second aim of the paper is to argue for a broader notion of rationality than what is typically assumed in formal epistemology. On this broader understanding of rationality, classical decision theoretic principles such as expected utility maximization play a less important role.",

Starting from the shortcomings of the traditional view of knowledge, this paper analyzes how probabilistic theory can cope with uncertainty by adjusting the strength of beliefs, so as to gradually approach the truth. Bayesian epistemology has shown its unique application potential in the fields of science, medicine and economic forecasting. Especially, Bayesian epistemology can enhance rational belief in dynamic environment through the update mechanism of conditional probability. Although Bayesian epistemology has many advantages, it has obvious limitations in its application to non-empirical fields such as ethics and metaphysics. This paper also explores the importance of Bayesianism in knowledge construction and compares it with other epistemological models such as evidentialism and dependability. This paper argues that although Bayesianism provides flexible instrumental support for knowledge construction, it still has great limitations in dealing with fuzzy and non-quantitative knowledge and ethical decision-making, which limits its application to broader epistemological problems. At the same time, it is pointed out that probabilistic epistemology can be combined with other methods to expand its application scope.",

Ramsey ignored the fact that Keynes\u2019s method was based on using Boole\u2019s relational, propositional logic that required that the propositions had to be connected, related or similar before the formal, mathematical, symbolic logic could be applied. Keynes pointed out that the \u201c\u2026analogy between orders of similarity and probability is so great that its apprehension will greatly assist that of the ideas I wish to convey\u201d (Keynes, 1921, p.36; italics added). Ramsay failed to grasp Keynes\u2019s analogy between similarity and probability before criticizing Keynes. Ramsey\u2019s main example of supposed errors in Keynes\u2019s analysis relies on examples, such as his \u201cMy carpet is green, Napoleon was a great general \u201c(Ramsey, 1922, p.3), which involves dissimilar and unrelated propositions which are not connected. Keynes\u2019s introductory comments on p.36 were then explored in Part III of the A Treatise on Probability in far greater depth and detail by Keynes. Keynes\u2019s objective, probability relations are simply objective relations connecting old, known situations with new situations that can be shown to be related. Human pattern recognition skills involve using resemblance functions based on past memory that projects past knowledge of old situations into new situations, where there are similarities that are seen to exist between the old, known situation and a new, unexplored situation. One then can come up with a rational degree of belief regarding how some new situation will play out, given the similarities that exist between the old and new situations. All of Ramsey\u2019s examples attacking Keynes\u2019s theory involve examples such as the green carpet -Napoleon example above. Herbert ......",

Ramsey made an intellectual mess that made it impossible for a reader to understand what Keynes\u2019s formal relational, propositional logic was. This mess can be fixed to some degree by rewriting it in the following manner-Mr. Keynes takes probability as being indefinable if a single definition is required to be given. Let p and q be related propositions, where p contains the premise(s) and q is a conclusion(s) of an argument form based on p.

      "abstract": "The paper focuses on the review of current literature on formal philosophy. Special attention is paid to the review of the book \u00abIntroduction to Formal Philosophy\u00bb [Hansson, Hendricks, 2018]. The book is a consistent introduction to the problems of formal philosophy, a research tradition that relies on the precise mathematical tools in order to study traditional philosophical problems. The methods of formal philosophy are successfully applied not only to the problems of ontology, epistemology and philosophy of language but also relevant for the problems of ethics, axiology and social philosophy. The book demonstrates that it is not correct to identify formal philosophy with another area of study \u2013 philosophical logic, since formal philosophy uses not only logical methods of analysis, but also uses the tools of game theory, decision theory, probability theory, Bayesian statistics, and other theories. Although the book has a propaedeutic character, it also contains some open problems. These problems include the aggregation of the opinions of the group under the condition of a conflicting base of premises in the theory of public choice, there are still open problems in the interpretation of Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem and others. Certainly, formalization in itself is not a general solution to the particular philosophical problem, but only a tool that allows to formulate a problem in a more rigorous and precise way, which sometimes allows to reveal some unexpected consequences, some implicit contradictions and new solutions. Despite the importance of the concept of coherence in ethics, decision theory, philosophy of law, Bayesian epistemology, philosophy of science, the existing formalizations of the concept of coherence are highly specialized for epistemology, researchers recognize the lack of the relevant explanatory models. Overall, the book is an excellent introduction in to the field of formal philosophy, which provides a general overview of different aspects of formal philosophy and the opportunity to study particular research topics by means of an extensive bibliography accompanying each of the chapters.",

      "abstract": "This paper explores Paul Feyerabend\u2019s epistemology of mystery, tracing its evolution from his earlier epistemological anarchism to its culmination in a metaphysics that emphasises the ineffability of ultimate reality. Feyerabend\u2019s critique of scientific materialism, rooted in his rejection of rigid methodological rules, highlights the historical interplay of rational and irrational elements in scientific progress. Drawing on Aristotle\u2019s conception of metaphysics as free and divine, the paper examines the dynamic relationship between Being and knowing in dialogue with Feyerabend\u2019s pluralistic approach. Our analysis shows Feyerabend\u2019s insistence on the contingent and narrative nature of human knowledge aligning with the Greek recognition of ineffability while diverging in its rejection of metaphysical absolutism. Feyerabend\u2019s later metaphysics embraces change, multiplicity, and the interconnectedness of human practices and Being, challenging the reductionism of scientific realism. Feyerabend\u2019s \u2018manifest reality\u2019 shaped by cultural and historical conditions likely betrays the influence of Frege\u2019s formal systems on his thought, exemplified in his critique of Parmenides\u2019 monism. The study further discusses Feyerabend\u2019s dynamic metaphysics in light of Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s influence, emphasising ultimate reality as unknowable yet responsive to human engagement. By juxtaposing these perspectives, a renewed engagement with metaphysics in contemporary philosophy is warranted. Such a renewed focus highlights metaphysics\u2019 role in challenging epistemological constraints, fostering an understanding of reality that integrates ontology and epistemology. Ultimately, the paper positions Feyerabend\u2019s work as a bridge between classical metaphysics and modern philosophical inquiry, challenging the dominance of reductionist frameworks and advocating for a pluralistic, narrative-rich approach to science and epistemology.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recently, some have challenged the idea that there are genuine norms of diachronic rationality. Part of this challenge has involved offering replacements for diachronic principles. Skeptics about diachronic rationality believe that we can provide an error theory for it by appealing to synchronic updating rules that, over time, mimic the behavior of diachronic norms. In this paper, I argue that the most promising attempts to develop this position within the Bayesian framework are unsuccessful. I sketch a new synchronic surrogate that draws upon some of the features of each of these earlier attempts. At the heart of this discussion is the question of what exactly it means to say that one norm is a surrogate for another. I argue that surrogacy, in the given context, can be taken as a proxy for the degree to which formal and traditional epistemology can be made compatible.",

Formal means of exact epistemology \u2013 languages of knowledge representation and logic of reasoning \u2013 and their practical implementation in computer systems provide constructive imitation and strengthening of some aspects of human intelligent activity. The formalization of cognitive activity is extremely in demand in the humanities, in particular, in the sciences of human and society.

For a correct description of social reality, the question of the respondents\u2019 rational perception of the elements of the questionnaire and the measure of rationality of individuals and their groups is not the last one. The scientific and constructively implemented apparatus of exact epistemology is the JSM-method of automated research support. The method has logical means for presenting opinions, as well as the formal presentation of a closed sociological poll. The instrumental capabilities of the JSM method provide a reasonable acceptance of new knowledge based on an expanded concept of rationality, including rationality as an argued opinion and argumentation, supported by formalized heuristics and the transformation of unclear ideas into precisely defined concepts.",

It is shown that under both a forward causal and a backward evidential (or diagnostic) reading of the conditional, this appropriateness condition reduces to conditional probability under some natural circumstances. Because this is in particular the case for the so-called diagnostic reading of the conditional, this analysis might help to explain some of Douven and Verbrugge\u2019s (Cognition 117:302\u2013318, 2010) empirical observations.",

At times it has been considered as a one-way, top-down, instrumental and rational dominance while at other times, planning theory, in more fortunate moments, has tried to divide concepts of power between different actors through a communicative rationality-based process. This article locates Foucault\u2019s theory of power in relation to recent planning theories as a magnifier in order to reveal the invisible or neglected lines of urban planning theories. The paper shows how the epistemology of power occurs in the six urban planning theories of synoptic, incremental, transactive, advocacy, bargaining and communicative. Finally, the main point of Foucault\u2019s power theory will be derived into two suppositions: firstly, where planning results from the normalization of free and formal subjects when the power game of the government has been rejected; secondly, the characteristics of planning and planner from a power point of view are explained by understanding planning as an opportunity for the presence of power and resistance.",

We ask two fundamental epistemological questions regarding each hypothesis: First, how much confirmation does a positive test lend to each hypothesis? Second, how much evidence does a positive test provide for each hypothesis against its negation? We respond to each question within a formal Bayesian framework. We construe degree of confirmation as the difference between the posterior probability of the hypothesis and its prior, and the strength of evidence for a hypothesis against its alternative in terms of their likelihood ratio. We find that test specificity\u2014and coinfection probabilities when making inferences about C\u2014were key determinants of confirmation and evidence. Tests with <\u200987% specificity could not provide strong evidence (likelihood ratio\u2009>\u20098) for V against \u00acV regardless of sensitivity. Accordingly, low specificity tests could not provide strong evidence in favor of C in all plausible scenarios modeled. We also show how a positive influenza A test disconfirms C and provides weak evidence against C in dependence on the probability that the patient is influenza A infected given that his/her symptoms are not caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis points out some caveats that should be considered when attributing symptoms or death of a positively tested patient to SARS-CoV-2.",

Savage (The foundations of statistics, Wiley, New York, 1954) limited axiomatic rationality to small worlds (S, C), that is, situations in which the exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of future states S and their consequences C are known. Others have interpreted axiomatic rationality as a categorical norm for how human beings should reason, arguing in addition that violations would lead to real costs such as money pumps. Yet a review of the literature shows little evidence that violations are actually associated with any measurable costs. Limiting axiomatic rationality to small worlds, I propose a naturalized version of rationality for situations of intractability and uncertainty (as opposed to risk), all of which are not in (S, C). In these situations, humans can achieve their goals by relying on heuristics that may violate axiomatic rationality. The study of ecological rationality requires formal models of heuristics and an analysis of the structures of environments these can exploit. It lays the foundation of a moderate naturalism in epistemology, providing statements about heuristics we should use in a given situation. Unlike axiomatic rationality, ecological rationality can explain less-is-more effects (when using less information can be expected to generate more accurate predictions), formalize when one should move from \u2018is\u2019 to \u2018ought,\u2019 and be evaluated by goals beyond coherence, such as predictive accuracy, frugality, and efficiency. Ecological rationality can be seen as a formalization of means\u2013end instrumentalist rationality, based on Herbert Simon\u2019s insight that rational behavior is a function of the mind and its environment.",
