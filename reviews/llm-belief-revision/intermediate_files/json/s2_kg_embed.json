      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods which map entities and relations to unique embeddings in the KG have shown promising results on many reasoning tasks. However, the same embedding dimension for both dense entities and sparse entities will cause either over parameterization (sparse entities) or under fitting (dense entities). Normally, a large dimension is set to get better performance. Meanwhile, the inference time grows log-linearly with the number of entities for all entities are traversed and compared. Both the parameter and inference become challenges when working with huge amounts of entities. Thus, we propose PIE, a \\textbf{p}arameter and \\textbf{i}nference \\textbf{e}fficient solution. Inspired from tensor decomposition methods, we find that decompose entity embedding matrix into low rank matrices can reduce more than half of the parameters while maintaining comparable performance. To accelerate model inference, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task, which can be seen as fine-grained entity typing. By randomly masking and recovering entities' connected relations, the task learns the co-occurrence of entity and relations. Utilizing the fine grained typing, we can filter unrelated entities during inference and get targets with possibly sub-linear time requirement. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities. Moreover, we prove effectiveness of the proposed solution on the Open Graph Benchmark large scale challenge dataset WikiKG90Mv2 and achieve the state of the art performance.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an effective method for link prediction in knowledge graphs, with numerous models demonstrating significant success. However, many existing KGE models struggle to effectively represent complex relationships and often face challenges related to a substantial number of missing triples. While enhancing KGE models through analogical reasoning offers a potential solution, current approaches typically depend on positive samples that are similar to the target for learning analogy embeddings. In real-world applications, data imbalance and incompleteness hinder the identification of sufficient positive examples, resulting in suboptimal performance in analogical inference. To this end, we propose a novel enhanced framework called Ne_AnKGE, which is based on negative analogical reasoning. First, Ne_AnKGE uses negative sample analogical reasoning to mitigate the scarcity of similar positive samples in analogical reasoning, while enhancing the link prediction ability of the basic model. Additionally, to enhance the model\u2019s ability to represent complex relationships and overcome the limitations of relying on a single KGE model, the Ne_AnKGE framework integrates the outputs of TransE and RotatE, both of which have been enhanced through negative sample analogical reasoning. Extensive experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of Ne_AnKGE.",

Most existing studies on multimodal knowledge graph embedding belong to inductive reasoning. These methods are limited in their ability to infer incomplete triples and difficult to capture complex correlations. To solve this problem, we adapt the method of analogical reasoning to implement the MKGE model enhanced by analogical reasoning. Analogical reasoning relies on the similarity between nodes for reasoning without extensive data summarization, which can compensate for the shortcomings of inductive reasoning. Specifically, this paper utilizes the vector similarity of nodes to obtain analogy nodes at three levels: relation-level, entity-level, and triple-level. Then, we design a new analogy mapping method. We generate aggregate scores based on corresponding scores using three levels of analogy nodes. Finally, we combine the original embedding method to obtain the results. We conduct experiments on WN9-IMG. The results show that our method achieves excellent performance compared to the baseline model.",

However, existing methods for mining and reasoning from GeoKGs, such as popular knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques, lack geographic awareness. This study aims to enhance general-purpose KGE by developing new strategies and integrating geometric features of spatial relations, including topology, direction, and distance, to infuse the embedding process with geographic intuition. The new model is tested on downstream link prediction tasks, and the results show that the inclusion of geometric features, particularly topology and direction, improves prediction accuracy for both geoentities and spatial relations. Our research offers new perspectives for integrating spatial concepts and principles into the GeoKG mining process, providing customized GeoAI solutions for geospatial challenges.",

This paper proposes a semantic-aware event link reasoning over an industrial knowledge graph embedding time series data. Its knowledge graph skeleton is constructed through a specific manufacturing process. NLTK is used to transform technical documents into a structured industrial knowledge graph. We employ deep learning (DL)-based models to obtain semantic information related to product quality prediction using time series data collected from IoT devices. Then the prediction information is attached to the specified node in the knowledge graph. Thus, the knowledge graph will describe the dynamic semantic information of manufacturing contexts. Meanwhile, a dynamic event link reasoning model that uses graph embedding to aggregate manufacturing processes information is proposed. The implicit information with industrial temporal knowledge can be further mined and inferred. The case study has shown that the proposed knowledge graph link reasoning reflects dynamic temporal characteristics. Compared to the classical knowledge graph prediction models, our model is superior to the baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding is efficient method for reasoning over known facts and inferring missing links. Existing methods are mainly triplet-based or graph-based. Triplet-based approaches learn the embedding of missing entities by a single triple only. They ignore the fact that the knowledge graph is essentially a graph structure. Graph-based methods consider graph structure information but ignore the contextual information of nodes in the knowledge graph, making them unable to discern valuable entity (relation) information. In response to the above limitations, we propose a general graph transformer framework for knowledge graph embedding (TGformer). It is the first to use a graph transformer to build knowledge embeddings with triplet-level and graph-level structural features in the static and temporal knowledge graph. Specifically, a context-level subgraph is constructed for each predicted triplet, which models the relation between triplets with the same entity. Afterward, we design a knowledge graph transformer network (KGTN) to fully explore multi-structural features in knowledge graphs, including triplet-level and graph-level, boosting the model to understand entities (relations) in different contexts. Finally, semantic matching is adopted to select the entity with the highest score. Experimental results on several public knowledge graph datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in link prediction.",

      "abstract": "Numerical reasoning is an essential task for supporting machine learning applications, such as recommendation and information retrieval. The reasoning task aims to compare two items and infer new facts (e.g., is taller than) by leveraging existing relational information and numerical attributes (e.g., the height of an entity) in knowledge graphs. However, most existing methods rely on leveraging attribute encoders or additional loss functions to predict numerical relations. Therefore, the prediction performance is often not robust in cases when attributes are sparsely observed. In this paper, we propose a Relation-AAware attribute representation learning-based Knowledge Graph Embedding method for numerical reasoning tasks, which we call RAKGE. RAKGE incorporates a newly proposed attribute representation learning mechanism, which can leverage the association between relations and their corresponding numerical attributes. In addition, we introduce a robust self-supervised learning method to generate unseen positive and negative examples, thereby making our approach more reliable when numerical attributes are sparsely available. In the evaluation of three real-world datasets, our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of up to 65.1% in Hits@1 and up to 52.6% in MRR compared to the best competitor. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/learndatalab/RAKGE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Knowledge Graph (KG) is becoming increasingly important in the biomedical field. Deriving new and reliable knowledge from existing knowledge by KG embedding technology is a cutting-edge method. Some add a variety of additional information to aid reasoning, namely multimodal reasoning. However, few works based on the existing biomedical KGs are focused on specific diseases. Results This work develops a construction and multimodal reasoning process of Specific Disease Knowledge Graphs (SDKGs). We construct SDKG-11, a SDKG set including five cancers, six non-cancer diseases, a combined Cancer5 and a combined Diseases11, aiming to discover new reliable knowledge and provide universal pre-trained knowledge for that specific disease field. SDKG-11 is obtained through original triplet extraction, standard entity set construction, entity linking and relation linking. We implement multimodal reasoning by reverse-hyperplane projection for SDKGs based on structure, category and description embeddings. Multimodal reasoning improves pre-existing models on all SDKGs using entity prediction task as the evaluation protocol. We verify the model\u2019s reliability in discovering new knowledge by manually proofreading predicted drug\u2013gene, gene\u2013disease and disease\u2013drug pairs. Using embedding results as initialization parameters for the biomolecular interaction classification, we demonstrate the universality of embedding models. Availability and implementation The constructed SDKG-11 and the implementation by TensorFlow are available from https://github.com/ZhuChaoY/SDKG-11.

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning involves inferring future unknown facts based on historical data. Current approaches to temporal reasoning can be broadly categorized into two main paradigms: embedding-based methods and symbolic methods. While embedding-based methods excel at capturing time by representing temporal facts as vectors, symbolic methods exploit temporal dependencies using techniques such as random walks for inference purposes. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit both the inherent time and intricate temporal relationship patterns simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose temporal neural probabilistic logic learning (TNPLL), an innovative framework that seamlessly integrates symbolic logic with neural embeddings for robust temporal reasoning. Our approach incorporates two key components: a set of temporal logic rules equipped with explicit temporal relationships and a scoring module implemented through a novel temporal memory network architecture. The proposed method effectively combines time and temporal relationship patterns to predict future facts. We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that TNPLL achieves improved performance while fully leveraging time information. Specifically, our framework excels in scenarios where prior knowledge is available, but data samples are sparse. The experimental outcomes show that TNPLL outperforms state-of-the-art models in such cases.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a popular method for KG reasoning and training KGEs with higher dimension are usually preferred since they have better reasoning capability. However, high-dimensional KGEs pose huge challenges to storage and computing resources and are not suitable for resource-limited or time-constrained applications, for which faster and cheaper reasoning is necessary. To address this problem, we propose DualDE, a knowledge distillation method to build low-dimensional student KGE from pre-trained high-dimensional teacher KGE. DualDE considers the dual-influence between the teacher and the student. In DualDE, we propose a soft label evaluation mechanism to adaptively assign different soft label and hard label weights to different triples, and a two-stage distillation approach to improve the student's acceptance of the teacher. Our DualDE is general enough to be applied to various KGEs. Experimental results show that our method can successfully reduce the embedding parameters of a high-dimensional KGE by 7\u00d7 - 15\u00d7 and increase the inference speed by 2\u00d7 - 6\u00d7 while retaining a high performance. We also experimentally prove the effectiveness of our soft label evaluation mechanism and two-stage distillation approach via ablation study.",

      "abstract": "The Temporal Knowledge Graph(TKG) reasoning is an imperative task for various applications of TKG. However, reasoning over TKGs which aims to predict future facts has been less explored. Intuitively, entities and relations in TKG change differently over time, and the variations are different. It also can be observed that what happens in the past may affect the future. Apart from these, structure information that exists in the neighborhood of a given entity in a KG has been proven to be important. Inspired by these, a novel graph embedding method for TKG reasoning, called time-structure-history graph embedding (TSHGE), is proposed in this paper. TSHGE consists of three progressive learning units. The first time information learning unit employs a novel time-aware mechanism to encode the time influence on entities and relations. Then a relation-aware GAT (Graph Attention Network) is used in the structure information learning unit to model the 1-hop neighborhoods of all entities in a KG at each timestamp in TKG. Finally, the history information learning unit utilizes GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to learn history information from various facts. Then the ultimate embedding representations of entities and relations can be obtained for the prediction of future facts. The evaluations on three public TKG datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of TSHGE for predicting future facts.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) answers logical queries over a knowledge graph (KG), and embedding-based KGR (EKGR) becomes popular recently, which embeds both queries and KG entities such that the vector embeddings of a query and its answer entities are similar. Compared with traditional KGR methods based on subgraph matching, EKGR produces fewer intermediate results and is more robust to missing and noisy information in the KG. However, existing systems are inefficient for serving online EKGR queries because they can only batch queries of the same type for execution (i.e., query-level batching ) and hence have limited batching opportunities due to the heterogeneity of queries. To serve EKGR queries efficiently, we propose the Atom system with operator-level batching, which decomposes queries into operators and batches operators of the same type from different queries for execution. The insight is that the types of operators are far fewer than the types of queries, and thus different queries typically share common operators, yielding more batching opportunities. To schedule the operators, Atom adopts a hybrid policy, which improves system throughput and avoids starving rare operators. For efficiency, Atom incorporates system optimizations including two-level pipeline, opportunistic submission, pre-allocated memory buffer, and tailored GPU kernels. Experiment results show that compared with existing systems, Atom can improve query throughput by over 20x and reduce query latency by over 5x. Micro experiments suggest that the designs and optimizations are effective in improving system performance.",
