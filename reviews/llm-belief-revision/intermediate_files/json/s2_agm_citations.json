In contrast, we allow for non-Bayesian updating. Zhao (2022) and Dominiak et al. (2022) both study distance minimization \u201cgeneral information;\u201d information is a subset I of \u2206(S) rather than an event. This more general notion of information requires significantly different axioms. Moreover, Zhao (2022) focuses on Bayes\u2019 rule. There is a large literature in experimental economics and psychology documenting various belief biases, and excellent surveys can be found in Camerer (1995) and Benjamin (2019). There is also growing number of papers taking axiomatic approaches to studying forms of non-Bayesian updating."
