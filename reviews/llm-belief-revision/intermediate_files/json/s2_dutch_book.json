      "abstract": "The much\u2010debated Reflection principle states that a coherent agent's credences must match their estimates for their future credences. Defenders claim that there are Dutch\u2010book arguments in its favor, putting it on the same normative footing as probabilistic coherence. Critics claim that those arguments rely on the implicit, implausible assumption that the agent is introspective: that they are certain what their own credences are. In this paper, we clarify this debate by surveying several different conceptions of the book scenario. We show that the crucial disagreement hinges on whether agents who are not introspective are known to reliably act on their credences: if they are, then coherent Reflection failures are (at best) ephemeral; if they are not, then Reflection failures can be robust\u2014and perhaps rational and coherent. We argue that the crucial question for future debates is which notion of coherence makes sense for such unreliable agents and sketch a few avenues to explore.",

      "abstract": "Two of the most influential arguments for Bayesian updating (\"Conditionalization\") -- Hilary Greaves' and David Wallace's Accuracy Argumentand David Lewis'\u00a0Diachronic Dutch Book Argument-- turn out to imose a strong and surprising limitation on rational uncertainty: that one can never be rationally uncertain of what one's evidence is. Many philosophers (\"externalists\") reject that claim, and now seem to face a difficult choice: either to endorse the arguments and give up Externalism, or to reject the arguments and lose some of the best justifications of Bayesianism. The author argues that the key to resolving this conflict lies in recognizing that both arguments are plan-based, in that they argue for Conditionalization by first arguing that one should planto conditionalize. With this in view, we can identify the culprit common to both arguments: for an externalist, they misconceive the requirement to carry out a plan made at an earlier time. They should therefore not persuade us to reject Externalism. Furthermore, rethinking the nature of this requirement allows us to give two new arguments for Conditionalization that do not rule out rational uncertainty about one's evidence and that can thus serve as common ground in the debate between externalists and their opponents.",

Some alleged requirements, such as probabilistic coherence and conditionalization, are plausible. Others, such as credal transparency and reflection, may be less so.

Dutch book arguments are often put forth to argue that ideal rationality requires being coherent. I show that we can justify that it is better to be less incoherent by showing that decreased incoherence is associated with decreased losses from Dutch books. While incoherent thinkers can never be immune from Dutch book losses, the amount they stand to lose, given that we standardize bet sizes, is greater the more incoherent their credences are.",

We say the agent is Dutch-booked when they are willing to accept all bets, but their payoff is negative under each state either ex-post, or in expectation given the objective conditional probabilities of the discoveries (i.e., the correct data-generating process, DGP). Respectively, an agent cannot be Dutch-booked if and only if they update their beliefs with Bayes rule either from the previous belief, even using misspecified likelihood functions, or from one lexicographic prior, using the correct data-generating process. Under a large population interpretation of the DGP, this means that a population can suffer aggregate losses under all states when different individuals update their beliefs from different (lexicographic) priors, or using misspecified likelihoods. Thus, the Dutch-book argument offers a general characterization of the perils of misspecification.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the philosophical discourse of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 on the immateriality of the soul (tajarrud al-nafs), with a focus on his seminal work, al-Shaw\u0101hid al-Rub\u016bbiyyah. Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, the founder of the transcendent philosophy (\u1e25ikmah muta\u2018\u0101liyah), developed a system rooted in foundational principles, including the primacy of existence (a\u1e63\u0101lat al-wuj\u016bd), the gradation of existence (tashk\u012bk al-wuj\u016bd), and substantial motion (\u1e25arakah jawhariyyah). His philosophical method integrates rational demonstration (burh\u0101n \u2018aql\u012b), theology (kal\u0101m), Qur\u2019anic insights, and mysticism (\u2018irf\u0101n), creating a unique and comprehensive framework. The research addresses a gap in the systematic analysis of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s articulation of the soul\u2019s immateriality in al-Shaw\u0101hid al-Rub\u016bbiyyah, particularly within the third chapter (mashhad), where metaphysical principles intersect with discussions on the soul. Employing a descriptive, analytical, and argumentative methodology, the study identifies 14 structured arguments presented by Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, evaluating their coherence and strength. Findings reveal that while many arguments are robust and deeply integrated into his philosophical system, others, particularly those based on textual and testimonial evidence, require refinement. These supplementary arguments serve to reinforce philosophical conviction rather than diminish logical validity. This research contributes to Islamic metaphysics by providing a focused analysis of al-Shaw\u0101hid al-Rub\u016bbiyyah, offering insights into a relatively understudied text in Sadrian philosophy. It bridges classical Islamic thought with contemporary philosophical inquiry, highlighting the relevance of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s views on the immaterial soul in understanding metaphysical anthropology and eschatology.",

      "abstract": "According to the PCCP thesis, the probability of a conditional A\u2009\u2192\u2009C is the conditional probability P(C|A). This claim is undermined by Lewis\u2019 triviality results, which purport to show that apart from trivial cases, PCCP is not true. In the present article we show that the only rational, \u201cDutch Book-resistant\u201d extension of the agent\u2019s beliefs concerning non-conditional sentences A and C to the conditional A\u2009\u2192\u2009C is by assuming that P(A\u2009\u2192\u2009C)\u2009=\u2009P(C|A) (i.e., in accord with PCCP). In other cases a diachronic Dutch Book against the agent can be constructed. There is a tension between our findings and Lewis\u2019 results, which needs to be explained. Therefore, we present a probability space which corresponds in a natural way to the diachronic Dutch Book\u2014and which allows the conditional A\u2009\u2192\u2009C to be interpreted as an event in a mathematically sound way. It also allows to formalize the notion of conditionalizing A\u2009\u2192\u2009C on \u00acC which plays a crucial role in Lewis\u2019 proof. Our conclusion is that Lewis\u2019 proof is circular, so it cannot be considered to be a sound argument against PCCP.",

I introduce a Dutch book for a variant of the Sleeping Beauty problem and argue that evidential decision theorists fall prey to it, whether they are halfers or thirders. The argument crucially requires that an action can provide evidence for what the agent would do not only at other decision points where she has exactly the same information, but also at decision points where she has different but \u201csymmetric\u201d information.",
