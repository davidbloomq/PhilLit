      "abstract": "The problem of iterated belief revision, which concerns how rational agents modify their beliefs in response to new information over time, lies at the core of understanding rational belief change. This article examines the interplay between the following two prominent frameworks for iterated belief revision: the qualitative Darwiche and Pearl\u2019s approach (abbrev. DP approach) and the quantitative Spohn conditionalization. In particular, we prove that the DP approach is too liberal (under-constrained) to capture Spohn\u2019s conditionalization (confined to revision scenarios); hence, the former cannot be regarded as a precise qualitative counterpart of the latter. Against this background, we provide insights into the essential semantic constraints on total preorders over the possible worlds needed to strengthen the DP approach and achieve alignment with Spohn\u2019s method.",

      "abstract": "The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic. Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others: lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe, moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.",

Checking whether it does is not obvious, as the contribution of each belief revision is not isolated from the others, and the same information may be given not directly but by deduction. An algorithm for checking whether forgetting reduces information is given for a number of iterated belief revision operators: lexicographic, natural, severe, plain severe, moderate severe, restrained, very radical and full meet revisions. It may take exponential time in the worst case, which is expected given that the problem is coNP-hard, even in the Horn restriction. It is in coNP for homogeneous sequences of lexicographic revisions.",

The seminal work of Darwiche and Pearl (DP approach, for short) remains the most dominant, despite its well-documented shortcomings. In this article, we make further observations on the DP approach. Firstly, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal's operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn's conditionalization are inconsistent with (P). Lastly, we show that the DP postulates allow for more revision polices than the ones that can be captured by identifying belief states with total preorders over possible worlds, a fact implying that a preference ordering (over possible worlds) is an insufficient representation for a belief state.",

The emphasis in the paper is on foundational questions about the nature of and motivation for various constraints, and about the methodology of the evaluation of putative counterexamples to proposed constraints. Some specific constraints that have been proposed are criticized. The paper emphasizes the importance of meta-information\u2014information about one\u2019s sources of information\u2014and argues that little of substance can be said about constraints on iterated belief revision at a level of abstraction that lacks the resources for explicit representation of meta-information.",

In\n\nthis logic an agent may believe a formula is true even\n\nthough the subjective probability of the formula is less\n\nthan 1.0. Similarly, after revision by a formula \u03d5, the\n\nagent will believe \u03d5 is true, even though the agent\u2019s\n\nsubjective probability of \u03d5 may be less than 1.0. We establish a\n\ncorrespondence with the hallmark AGM postulates for belief\n\nrevision. Moreover, we use Jeffrey Conditionalisation to\n\nestablish a link with iterated belief change. To this end,\n\nwe develop an approach that satisfies appropriately\n\nmodified Darwiche-Pearl postulates (with clear\n\njustification). Thus, we provide a connection between\n\nquantitative probabilistic approaches on the one hand and\n\nthe qualitative formulation of belief change, on the other.\n\nThis work holds potential for the development\n\nof practical belief revision systems by applying a\n\n(qualitative) approach to belief change in probabilistic,\n\nuncertain domains.",

      "abstract": "The AGM paradigm for belief change, as originally introduced by Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson, lacks any guidelines for the process of iterated revision. One of the most influential work addressing this problem is Darwiche and Pearl\u2019s approach (DP approach, for short), which, despite its well-documented shortcomings, remains to this date the most dominant. In this article, we make further observations on the DP approach. In particular, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh\u2019s relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal\u2019s operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn\u2019s conditionalization are inconsistent with axiom (P). The whole study, essentially, indicates that two fundamental aspects of the revision process, namely, iteration and relevance, are in deep conflict, and opens the discussion for a potential reconciliation towards a comprehensive formal framework for knowledge dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Belief revision and update, two significant types of belief change, both focus on how an agent modify her beliefs in presence of new information. The most striking difference between them is that the former studies the change of beliefs in a static world while the latter concentrates on a dynamically-changing world. The famous AGM and KM postulates were proposed to capture rational belief revision and update, respectively. However, both of them are too permissive to exclude some unreasonable changes in the iteration. In response to this weakness, the DP postulates and its extensions for iterated belief revision were presented. Furthermore, Rodrigues integrated these postulates in belief update. Unfortunately, his approach does not meet the basic requirement of iterated belief update. This paper is intended to solve this problem of Rodrigues's approach. Firstly, we present a modification of the original KM postulates based on belief states. Subsequently, we migrate several well-known postulates for iterated belief revision to iterated belief update. Moreover, we provide the exact semantic characterizations based on partial preorders for each of the proposed postulates. Finally, we analyze the compatibility between the above iterated postulates and the KM postulates for belief update.",

This raises a natural question: What is so distinctive about these three particular methods? Indeed, the common axiomatic ground for work on iterated revision, the AGM and Darwiche-Pearl postulates, leaves open a whole range of alternative proposals. In this paper, we show that it is satisfaction of an additional principle of \u201cIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives\u201d, inspired by the literature on Social Choice, that unites and sets apart our three \u201celementary\u201d revision operators. A parallel treatment of iterated belief contraction is also given, yielding a family of elementary contraction operators that includes, besides the well-known \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d operators, a new contraction operator that is related to restrained revision.",

      "abstract": "According to Boutillier, Darwiche, Pearl and others, principles for iterated revision can be characterised in terms of changing beliefs about conditionals. For iterated contraction a similar formulation is not known. This is especially because for iterated belief change the connection between revision and contraction via the Levi and Harper identity is not straightforward, and therefore, characterisation results do not transfer easily between iterated revision and contraction. In this article, we develop an axiomatisation of iterated contraction in terms of changing conditional beliefs. We prove that the new set of postulates conforms semantically to the class of operators like the ones given by Konieczny and Pino Perez for iterated contraction.",
