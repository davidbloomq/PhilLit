      "abstract": "\n Argumentation problems are concerned with determining the acceptability of a set of arguments from their relational structure. When the available information is uncertain, probabilistic argumentation frameworks provide modeling tools to account for it. The first contribution of this paper is a novel interpretation of probabilistic argumentation frameworks as probabilistic logic programs. Probabilistic logic programs are logic programs in which some of the facts are annotated with probabilities. We show that the programs representing probabilistic argumentation frameworks do not satisfy a common assumption in probabilistic logic programming (PLP) semantics, which is, that probabilistic facts fully capture the uncertainty in the domain under investigation. The second contribution of this paper is then a novel PLP semantics for programs where a choice of probabilistic facts does not uniquely determine the truth assignment of the logical atoms. The third contribution of this paper is the implementation of a PLP system supporting this semantics: smProbLog. smProbLog is a novel PLP framework based on the PLP language ProbLog. smProbLog supports many inference and learning tasks typical of PLP, which, together with our first contribution, provide novel reasoning tools for probabilistic argumentation. We evaluate our approach with experiments analyzing the computational cost of the proposed algorithms and their application to a dataset of argumentation problems.",

In this paper we study connections between ProbLog and a variant of another well-known formalism combining symbolic reasoning and reasoning under uncertainty, i.e. probabilistic argumentation. Specifically, we show that ProbLog is an instance of a form of Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (PAA) that builds upon Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA). The connections pave the way towards equipping ProbLog with alternative semantics, inherited from PAA/PABA, as well as obtaining novel argumentation semantics for PAA/PABA, leveraging on prior connections between ProbLog and argumentation. Further, the connections pave the way towards novel forms of argumentative explanations for ProbLog's outputs.",

We show how Jury-based Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation (JPAA) and a form of Jury-based Probabilistic Assumption-based Argumentation (JPABA) can naturally support forecasting, whereby subjective probability estimates are combined to make predictions about future events. The form of JPABA we consider is an instance of JPAA and results from integrating Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) and probability spaces expressed by Bayesian networks. We show how JPAA and (the considered form of) JPABA can support forecasting by allowing different forecasters to determine the probability of arguments (and, in JPABA, sentences) with respect to their own probability spaces, while sharing arguments (and, in JPABA, their components). We show in turn how this supports the aggregation of individual forecasts into group forecasts.",

For example, time intervals of availability have been added to arguments and relations. As a result, the output of Dung semantics varies over time. In this paper, we consider the situation in which arguments hold with a certain probability distribution during a given interval. To model the uncertain character of events, we propose different notions of temporal conflict between arguments according to the type of availabilities intersection (partial, inclusive, or total). Then, we refine these notions of conflict by a defeat relation, using criterion functions that evaluate an attack\u2019s significance according to the probability over time.",

Given an argumentation graph where vertices are arguments and edges are attacks or supports between arguments, the approach of probabilistic labellings relies on a probability space where the sample space is any specific set of argument labellings of the graph, so that any labelling outcome can be associated with a probability value. Argument labellings can feature a label indicating that an argument is not expressed, and in previous work these labellings were constructed by exploiting the subargument-completeness postulate according to which if an argument is expressed then its subarguments are expressed and through the use of the concept of \u2018subargument-complete subgraphs\u2019. While the use of such subgraphs is interesting to compare probabilistic labellings with other works in the literature, it may also hinder the comprehension of a relatively simple framework. In this short communication, we revisit the construction of probabilistic labellings and demonstrate how labellings can be specified without reference to the concept of subargument-complete subgraphs. By doing so, the framework is simplified and yields a more natural model of argumentation.",

      "abstract": "Structured argumentation involves drawing inferences from knowledge in order to construct arguments and counterarguments. Since knowledge can be uncertain, we can use a probabilistic approach to representing and reasoning with the knowledge. Individual arguments can be constructed from the knowledge, with the belief in each argument determined just from the belief in the formulae appearing in the argument. However, if the original knowledgebase is inconsistent, this does not take into account the counterarguments that can be constructed. We therefore need a wider perspective that revises the belief in individual arguments in order to take into account the counterarguments. To address this need, we present a framework for probabilistic argumentation that uses relaxation methods to give a coherent view on the knowledge, and thereby revises the belief in the arguments that are generated from the knowledge.",

Nonetheless the agent may have these attacks in mind and instead they may provide a proxy indicator through which one can infer the agent's intended argument graph (arguments and attacks). Consider online reviews, where reviews are collections of arguments for and against the product (positive and negative) under review and the rating indicates whether the positive or negative arguments succeed ultimately. In previous work [1] we have proposed a method that formalises this intuition and uses the constellations approach to probabilistic argumentation to construct a probability distribution over the set of arguments graphs the agent may have had in mind. In this paper we extend this proposal and provide a method, that uses Bayesian inference, to update the initial probability distribution using real data. We evaluate our proposal by conducting a number of simulations using synthetic data.",

This paper presents a new approach to straight-forwardly combine a rule-based system (RB) with a probabilistic graphical inference framework, i.e., na\u00a8\u0131ve Bayesian network (BN), towards probabilistic argumentation via a so-called probabilistic assumption-based argumentation (PABA) framework. A rule-based system (RB) formalizes its rules into defeasible logic under the assumption-based argumentation (ABA) framework while the Bayesian network (BN) provides probabilistic reasoning. By knowledge integration, while the former provides a solid testbed for inference, the latter helps the former to solve persistent con\ufb02icts by setting an acceptance threshold. By experiments, e \ufb00 ectiveness of this approach on con\ufb02ict resolution is shown via an example of liver disorder diagnosis. key words: knowledge integration, probabilistic argumentation, probabilistic",

      "abstract": "The combination of argumentation and probability paves the way to new accounts of qualitative and quantitative uncertainty, thereby offering new theoretical and applicative opportunities. Due to a variety of interests, probabilistic argumentation is approached in the literature with different frameworks, pertaining to structured and abstract argumentation, and with respect to diverse types of uncertainty, in particular the uncertainty on the credibility of the premises, the uncertainty about which arguments to consider, and the uncertainty on the acceptance status of arguments or statements. Towards a general framework for probabilistic argumentation, we investigate a labelling-oriented framework encompassing a basic setting for rule-based argumentation and its (semi-) abstract account, along with diverse types of uncertainty. Our framework provides a systematic treatment of various kinds of uncertainty and of their relationships and allows us to back or question assertions from the literature.",

      "abstract": "Neural-symbolic systems combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic formalisms. In this paper, we introduce a neural-symbolic system which combines restricted Boltzmann machines and probabilistic semi-abstract argumentation. We propose to train networks on argument labellings explaining the data, so that any sampled data outcome is associated with an argument labelling. Argument labellings are integrated as constraints within restricted Boltzmann machines, so that the neural networks are used to learn probabilistic dependencies amongst argument labels. Given a dataset and an argumentation graph as prior knowledge, for every example/case K in the dataset, we use a so-called K-maxconsistent labelling of the graph, and an explanation of case K refers to a K-maxconsistent labelling of the given argumentation graph. The abilities of the proposed system to predict correct labellings were evaluated and compared with standard machine learning techniques. Experiments revealed that such argumentation Boltzmann machines can outperform other classification models, especially in noisy settings.",
