To accomplish this goal G\u00e4rdenfors suggests that the AGM revision postulates concerning the conservative nature of belief revision can be interpreted in terms of a concept of epistemic entrenchment and that there are good empirical reasons to adopt this view as opposed to some form of foundationalist account of the justification of our beliefs. In this paper I argue that G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019 attempt to underwrite the AGM theory of belief revision by appealing to a form of coherentism is seriously inadequate for several reasons.",

In the present paper we take de Rijke's idea further, addressing the question whether there is a particular doxastic or epistemic logic implicit in AGM.",

In particular, most approaches impose very few constraints on the set of conditionals an agent can hold after revision of its belief set. In this paper we describe the method of natural revision that ensures the preservation of conditional beliefs after revision by an objective belief. Our model, based on a simple modal logic for beliefs and conditionals, extends the AGM theory of belief revision to account for sentences of objective revisions of a belief set. This model of revision ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Adopting the Ramsey test, natural revision provides truth conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. We show that the problem of determining acceptance of any such nested conditional can be reduced to acceptance tests for unnested conditionals, indicating that iterated revision can be simulated by virtual updates. We also briefly describe certain reductions to (sometimes tractable) propositional inference, and other informational properties.",

We give a number of interesting theoretical results related to the (generalized) AGM theory and show that our work can find important applications in dynamic environments employing non-classical logical formalisms. We focus on a particular such environment, namely ontology evolution in the Semantic Web, and show how our work can be used to provide ontology evolution researchers with powerful formal tools from the research area of belief revision.",

      "abstract": "Much current work in the study of belief revision goes back to a now classic paper due to Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson [AGM]. The central issue is how to revise an existing set of beliefs T to a new set of beliefs T \u2217A when a new piece of information A is received. If A is consistent with T , then it is easy: we just add A to T and close under logical inference to get the new set of beliefs. The harder problem is how to revise the theory T when a piece of information A inconsistent with T is received. Clearly, as Levi has suggested, T must first be contracted to a smaller theory T \u2032 = T \u2022 \u2212 \u00acA which is consistent with A and then A added to T \u2032. However, it is not clear how T \u2022 \u2212 \u00acA should be obtained. The mere deletion of \u00acA from T will clearly not leave us with a theory and there is in general no unique way to get a theory T \u2032 which is contained in T and does not contain \u00acA.",

For this, we introduce relational structures called &lt;em&gt;conditional doxastic models&lt;/em&gt; (CDM&amp;apos;s, for short). We show this setting to be equivalent to an epistemic version of the classical AGM Belief Revision theory. We present a &lt;em&gt;logic of conditional beliefs&lt;/em&gt; that is complete w.r.t. CDM's. Moving then to &lt;em&gt;belief updates&lt;/em&gt; (sometimes called &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; belief revision) induced by epistemic actions, we consider two particular cases: &lt;em&gt;public announcements&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;private announcements to subgroups&lt;/em&gt; of agents. We show how the standard semantics for these types of updates can be appropriately modified in order to apply it to CDM&amp;apos;s, thus incorporating belief revision into our notion of update. We provide a complete axiomatization of the corresponding dynamic doxastic logics. As an application, we solve a &amp;quot;cheating version&amp;quot; of the Muddy Children Puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen considerable work on two approaches to belief revision: the so-called foundations and coherence approaches. The foundations approach supposes that a rational agent derives its beliefs from justifications or reasons for these beliefs: in particular, that the agent holds some belief if and only if it possesses a satisfactory reason for that belief. According to the foundations approach, beliefs change as the agent adopts or abandons reasons. The coherence approach, in contrast, maintains that pedigrees do not matter for rational beliefs, but that the agent instead holds some belief just as long as it logically coheres with the agent's other beliefs. More specifically, the coherence approach supposes that revisions conform to minimal change principles and conserve as many beliefs as possible as specific beliefs are added or removed. The artificial intelligence notion of reason maintenance system (Doyle, 1979) (also called \u201ctruth maintenance system\u201d) has been viewed as exemplifying the foundations approach, as it explicitly computes sets of beliefs from sets of recorded reasons. The so-called AGM theory of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson (1985; 1988) exemplifies the coherence approach with its formal postulates characterizing conservative belief revision.",

The AGM paradigm is a powerful framework for modeling and implementing belief revision systems based on the principle of Minimal Change; it provides a rich and rigorous foundation for computer-based belief revision architectures. Maxi-adjustment is a belief revision strategy for theory bases that can be implemented using a standard theorem prover, and one that has been used successfully for several applications. In this paper we provide an anytime decision procedure for maxi-adjustments, and study its complexity. Furthermore, we outline a set of guidelines that serve as a protomethodology for building belief revision systems employing a maxi-adjustment. The algorithm is under development in the belief revision module of the CIN Project. 1 Introduction Belief Revision underlies many forms of intelligent behaviour. An intelligent agent must be adept at revising its beliefs in a rational way. The AGM...",

Un-like previous approaches in logic programming, our formal techniques are analogous to those of distance-based belief re-vision in propositional logic. In developing our results, we build upon the model theory of logic programs furnished by SE models. Since SE models provide a formal, monotonic characterisation of logic programs, we can adapt well-known techniques from the area of belief revision to revision in logic programs. We investigate two specific operators: (logic pro-gram) expansion and a revision operator based on the distance between the SE models of logic programs. It proves to be the case that expansion is an interesting operator in its own right, unlike in classical AGM-style belief revision where it is rel-atively uninteresting. Expansion and revision are shown to satisfy a suite of interesting properties; in particular, our revi-sion operators satisfy the majority of the AGM postulates for revision. A complexity analysis reveals that our revision op-erators do not increase the complexity of the base formalism. As a consequence, we present an encoding for computing the revision of a logic program by another, within the same logic programming framework.",
