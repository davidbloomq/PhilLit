      "abstract": "Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in\\nclassification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a\\nclassification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then\\ntaking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced.\\nFor many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic\\nimprovements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon\\ncan be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely\\nadditive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting\\ncan be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale\\nusing maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct\\napproximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting.\\nDirect multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived\\nthat exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass\\ngeneralizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We\\nsuggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by\\nfactors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative\\nformulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first\\ntruncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide\\ninterpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much\\nfaster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining\\napplications.",

      "abstract": "\"The contemporary dynamics of two neighboring Kullu devban (sacred groves) are analysed in this article. One of these devban is a model of community conservation based on indigenous belief system and management practices. The other suffered the opposite fate and was harvested in the last decade. While this latter devban is a challenge to simple models that view sacred groves as archetypical institutions of community conservation, the presence of the former shows that straightforward critiques of community-based conservation present only a partial picture. An ethnographic study of two taken locally, the key influences determining their changing and diverse fate emanate from spheres of property regimes, state policy and an environmental discourse that originate beyond the local community. The pre-colonial communal property of Kullu devta's was transformed into private property in colonial records. The environmentalist turn in state, donor agency and NGO policies and discourse, and recent institutions of self governance and resource management that attempt to recreate community play an important role in devban dynamics. While the micro-political analysis of devban reveals fault-lines in the world of social actors whose actions directly impinge on devban, an understanding of current trends influencing them requires a macro-political economic perspective. The political economy of Kullu devban is complex, dynamic and under-determined, and due to all these characters it permits diverse outcomes on the ground.\"",

      "abstract": "Psychologists' emerging interest in spirituality and religion as well as the relevance of each phenomenon to issues of psychological importance requires an understanding of the fundamental characteristics of each construct. On the basis of both historical considerations and a limited but growing empirical literature, we caution against viewing spirituality and religiousness as incompatible and suggest that the common tendency to polarize the terms simply as individual vs. institutional or \u2032good\u2032 vs. \u2032bad\u2032 is not fruitful for future research. Also cautioning against the use of restrictive, narrow definitions or overly broad definitions that can rob either construct of its distinctive characteristics, we propose a set of criteria that recognizes the constructs' conceptual similarities and dissimilarities. Rather than trying to force new and likely unsuccessful definitions, we offer these criteria as benchmarks for judging the value of existing definitions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Semi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.",

There is growing interest among educators in bringing making into K-12 education to enhance opportunities to engage in the practices of engineering, specifically, and STEM more broadly. This article describes three elements of the Maker Movement, and associated research needs, necessary to understand its promise for education: 1) digital tools, including rapid prototyping tools and low-cost microcontroller platforms, that characterize many making projects; 2) community infrastructure, including online resources and in-person spaces and events; and 3) the maker mindset, aesthetic principles, and habits of mind that are commonplace within the community. It further outlines how the practices of making align with research on beneficial learning environments.",

Jaroslav Pelikan, The Vindication ofTradition \" NATURE,\" AS ERNST CASSIRER CONCEIVED IT, \"YIELDS N O TH ING w i t h out ceremony\" (1955: 38-9). The national holiday is one of ceremony's vessels. Holidays are times set aside by custom or law to commemorate great events and their m en\u2014or gods. They recur weekly, as in Sabbath observance, or, in the case of national life, annually, as in the celebra\u00ad tion of the Fourth of July. In either case, holidays are \"seedbeds of virtue\" (Etzioni, 2001) that oppose the natural tendency to forget the past. The opening chapters of Deuteronomy provide the best examples. Moses has led his people to the Promised Land, but before they go to possess it he gives them a series of warnings. He knows that his people will soon live in a new world: cities, houses, vineyards, and olive groves in whose m aking they had no part. These are an inheritance, not an social research Vol 75 : No 1 : Spring 2008 75 acquisition: \"W hen you eat your fill there, be careful not to forget the Lord\" who gave these to you. And w hen you have plenty to eat and live in fine houses of your own building \"do not become proud and forget the Lord your God w ho brought you out of Egypt.\" To this end, three holidays m ust be observed: first, the Passover, then the Feast of Weeks, then the Feast of Tabernacles (Deuteronomy 5-9,16). W hen the conditions of life change drastically, the m ost decisive historical events will seem irrelevant, but holidays, Moses declares, will m ake the people rem em ber and keep them together. Collective memory, whose content holidays sustain, refers to the social distribution of beliefs, feelings, and moral judgm ents about the past. The prim ary vehicles of collective m emory are history\u2014the estab\u00ad lishing and propagating of facts about the past through research mono\u00ad graphs, textbooks, museums, and mass media\u2014and commemoration: the process of selecting from the historical record those facts most relevant to society's ideals and symbolizing them by iconography, m onum ents, shrines, place-names, and ritual observance. M ediating the relation betw een histoiy and individual belief, holidays are m ajor parts of all commemorative repertoires. Two analytic models orient the analysis of holiday rituals and their link to collective memory. The \"conflict m odel\" conceives ritual observances in term s of elites' quest to m aintain power and construes holidays as control devices inducing individuals to transfer com m it\u00ad m ent from local com m unities to the state. From the 1870s onward, Eric Hobsbawm (1983) observes, the rise o f electoral democracy in Europe and America m eant the masses could no longer be relied upon to follow their m asters; therefore \"rulers and middle-class observers rediscovered the im portance of 'irrational' [ritualistic] elem ents in the m aintenance of the social fabric and the social order\" (268). Mabel Berezin (1997) describes Italian leaders' efforts to condition citizens against democracy by m elding the public and privates spheres of their lives. Fascist program m ers w orked largely through holidays built upon a traditional infrastructure, the cult of the family, and church (see also Falaca-Zamponi, 1997.) Even \"by the latter part of the twentieth -centuiy,\" John Bodnar (1992) declares, America's \"public m em ory 76 social research [embodied in national holidays] rem ains a product of elite m anipu\u00ad lation, symbolic interaction, and contested discourse\" (20; see also Litwicki, 2000). The \"comm itm ent model,\" in contrast, presumes that elites and masses reaffirm their moral values together. Com m itm ent holidays are subsum ed under Robert Bellah's definition of \"practices of com m it\u00ad m ent,\" namely, \"shared activities that are not undertaken as means to an end but are ethically good in themselves. . . . A genuine com m u\u00ad nity\u2014w hether a marriage, a university, a whole society\u2014is constituted by such practices...",

      "abstract": "President Bush's initial frame for the attacks of September 11, 2001, overwhelmingly dominated the news. Using that frame as a springboard, this article advances a coherent conception of framing within a new model of the relationship between government and the media in U.S. foreign policy making. The cascading activation model supplements research using the hegemony or indexing approaches. The model explains how interpretive frames activate and spread from the top level of a stratified system (the White House) to the network of nonadministration elites, and on to news organizations, their texts, and the public--and how interpretations feed back from lower to higher levels. To illustrate the model's potential, the article explores the frame challenge mounted by two journalists, Seymour Hersh and Thomas Friedman, who attempted to shift the focus from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia. As hegemony theory predicts, 9/11 revealed yet again that media patrol the boundaries of culture and keep discord within conventional bounds. But inside those borders, even when government is promoting \"war\" against terrorism, media are not entirely passive receptacles for government propaganda, and the cascade model illuminates deviations from the preferred frame. As index theorists suggest, elite discord is a necessary condition for politically influential frame challenges. Among other things, the cascade model helps explain whether that condition arises, and how journalists can hinder or advance it.",

In contracting from a belief set, the result is the belief set(s) most similar to the original in which is not believed; similar considerations apply to belief revision. The modelling of belief change generalises the Grove modelling based on a system of spheres, where instead of having a total order on sets of possible worlds, we have a total order on sets of belief sets. Given this modelling, sets of postulates are determined for contraction and revision. The resulting postulate sets subsume those in the AGM approach. The approach sheds light on the foundations of belief revision in that, first, it provides a more general framework than the AGM approach; second, it, illustrates assumptions under lying the AGM approach; and third, it allows a &amp;quot;fine-grained &amp;quot; investigation of proposed principles underlying belief change. Lastly, it demonstrates that, at their most, basic, revision and contraction of beliefs are not interdefinable notions, but rather distinct concepts 1",

We mapped the Twitter networks of 10 controversial political topics, discovered clusters \u2013 subgroups of highly self-connected users \u2013 and coded messages and links in them for political orientation. We found that Twitter users are unlikely to be exposed to cross-ideological content from the clusters of users they followed, as these were usually politically homogeneous. Links pointed at grassroots web pages (e.g.: blogs) more frequently than traditional media websites. Liberal messages, however, were more likely to link to traditional media. Last, we found that more specific topics of controversy had both conservative and liberal clusters, while in broader topics, dominant clusters reflected conservative sentiment.",

      "abstract": "With sustained challenges to European rule in African and Asian colonies in the early 20th century, sexual prescriptions by class, race and gender became increasingly central to the politics of rule and subject to new forms of scrutiny by colonial states. Focusing on the Netherlands Indies and French Indochina, but drawing on other contexts, this article examines how the very categories of \u201ccolonizer\u201d and \u201ccolonized\u201d were increasingly secured through forms of sexual control which defined the common political interests of European colonials and the cultural investments by which they identified themselves. The metropolitan and colonial discourses on health, \u201cracial degeneracy,\u201d and social reform from this period reveal how sexual sanctions demarcated positions of power by enforcing middle\u2010class conventions of respectability and thus the personal and public boundaries of race.[sexuality, race\u2010thinking, hygiene, colonial cultures, Southeast Asia]",

Together these developments are engendering dramatic new opportunities for service innovation, the study of which is both timely and important. Fully understanding these opportunities challenges us to question conventional approaches that construe service as a distinctive form of socioeconomic exchange (i.e., as services) and to reconsider what service means and thus how service innovation may develop. The aim of this special issue, therefore, is to bring together some of the latest scholarship from the Marketing and Information Systems disciplines to advance theoretical developments on service innovation in a digital age.",
