      "abstract": "The remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), primarily driven by deep neural networks, have significantly impacted various aspects of our lives. However, the current challenges surrounding unsustainable computational trajectories, limited robustness, and a lack of explainability call for the development of next-generation AI systems. Neuro-symbolic AI (NSAI) emerges as a promising paradigm, fusing neural, symbolic, and probabilistic approaches to enhance interpretability, robustness, and trustworthiness while facilitating learning from much less data. Recent NSAI systems have demonstrated great potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive capabilities. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent progress in NSAI and analyze the performance characteristics and computational operators of NSAI models. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions of NSAI from both system and architectural perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in cybersecurity exhibit fundamental limitations: inadequate conceptual grounding leading to non-robustness against novel attacks; limited instructibility impeding analyst-guided adaptation; and misalignment with cybersecurity objectives. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.",

Neuro-symbolic AI focuses on this integration where the statistical methods are in particular neural networks. In recent years, there has been significant progress in this research field, where neuro-symbolic systems outperformed logical or neural models alone. Yet, neuro-symbolic AI is, comparatively speaking, still in its infancy and has not been widely adopted by machine learning practitioners. In this survey, we present the first mapping of neuro-symbolic techniques into families of frameworks based on their architectures, with several benefits: Firstly, it allows us to link different strengths of frameworks to their respective architectures. Secondly, it allows us to illustrate how engineers can augment their neural networks while treating the symbolic methods as black-boxes. Thirdly, it allows us to map most of the field so that future researchers can identify closely related frameworks.",

Our motivation is three fold. First, for machine learning researchers unaware of why the research community cares about relational representations, this article can serve as a gentle introduction. Second, for logical experts who are newcomers to the learning area, such an article can help in navigating the differences between finite vs infinite, and subjective probabilities vs random-world semantics. Finally, for researchers from statistical relational learning and neuro-symbolic AI, who are usually embedded in finite worlds with subjective probabilities, appreciating what infinite domains and random-world semantics brings to the table is of utmost theoretical import.",

As NeSy shows promise of reconciling the advantages of reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation and robust learning in neural networks, it may serve as a catalyst for the next generation of AI. In the present paper, we provide a systematic overview of the recent developments and important contributions of NeSy research. First, we introduce study history of this area, covering early work and foundations. We further discuss background concepts and identify key driving factors behind the development of NeSy. Afterward, we categorize recent landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge representation, knowledge embedding, and functionality. Next, we briefly discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several domains. Then, we benchmark several NeSy methods on three representative application tasks. Finally, we identify the open problems together with potential future research directions. This survey is expected to help new researchers enter this rapidly evolving field and accelerate the progress towards data-and knowledge-driven AI.",

      "abstract": "The integration of symbolic computing with neural networks has intrigued researchers since the first theorizations of Artificial intelligence (AI). The ability of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) methods to infer or exploit behavioral schema has been widely considered as one of the possible proxies for human-level intelligence. However, the limited semantic generalizability and the challenges in declining complex domains with pre-defined patterns and rules hinder their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. The unprecedented results achieved by connectionist systems since the last AI breakthrough in 2017 have raised questions about the competitiveness of NeSy solutions, with particular emphasis on the Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision fields. This survey examines task-specific advancements in the NeSy domain to explore how incorporating symbolic systems can enhance explainability and reasoning capabilities. Our findings are meant to serve as a resource for researchers exploring explainable NeSy methodologies for real-life tasks and applications.

However, traditional AI will remain inadequate because of issues such as explicit and implicit biases and explainability for operating independently in dynamic and complex environments for the foreseeable future. For human-autonomy teaming (HAT), trustworthy AI is crucial since machines/autonomy and humans work in collaboration for shared learning and joint reasoning for a given mission with combat speed and high accuracy, trust, and assurance. In this paper, we present a brief survey of recent advances, some key challenges, and future research directions for neuro-symbolic-reinforcement-learning-enabled trustworthy HAT.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks have been rapidly expanding in recent years, with novel strategies and applications. However, challenges such as interpretability, explainability, robustness, safety, trust, and sensibility remain unsolved in neural network technologies, despite the fact that they will unavoidably be addressed for critical applications. Attempts have been made to overcome the challenges in neural network computing by representing and embedding domain knowledge in terms of symbolic representations. Thus, the neuro-symbolic learning (NeSyL) notion emerged, which incorporates aspects of symbolic representation and bringing common sense into neural networks (NeSyL). In domains where interpretability, reasoning, and explainability are crucial, such as video and image captioning, question-answering and reasoning, health informatics, and genomics, NeSyL has shown promising outcomes. This review presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art NeSyL approaches, their principles, advances in machine and deep learning algorithms, applications such as opthalmology, and most importantly, future perspectives of this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps even ill-formed. In this article, we survey work that provides further evidence for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an emphasis on the following \"sore\" point: there is a common misconception that logic is for discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine learning, more generally, is for continuous properties. We report on results that challenge this view on the limitations of logic, and expose the role that logic can play for learning in infinite domains.",

Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures.

It argues that purely statistical language models, lacking intrinsic verification mechanisms, cannot deliver epistemic reliability and therefore require \u00abdisciplining\u00bb via logical and metacognitive components. Methodologically, the study combines a history-of-philosophy perspective\u2013from Aristotle, Descartes, Kant and Popper to current debates on the semantic limits of syntactic procedures (e.g., Searle\u2019s \u00abChinese Room\u00bb) \u2013 with a survey of technical strategies for embedding logic in AI. The paper traces the pendulum swing from symbolic (GOFAI) to neural approaches and shows an emerging consensus in favor of neuro-symbolic architectures that couple statistical power with the transparency of formal inference. It identifies three human critical-thinking components relevant for algorithms: a normative one (logical laws and rules), a descriptive one (awareness of common cognitive biases), and a prescriptive one (procedures for self-correction). Building on this mapping, it formulates principles of \u00ablogical discipline\u00bb for AI: explicit multi-step reasoning, internal self-verification and confidence estimation, tool-assisted fact-checking (calls to external modules and knowledge bases), causal modeling, and explainability. The analysis also clarifies key limitations: valid formal inference does not ensure truth under false premises; the absence of consciousness and intentionality precludes an \u00abintrinsic\u00bb drive to truth; long reasoning chains may rationalize an initial error. The paper contends that a human-in-the-loop paradigm is currently optimal: AI acts as a rapid logical filter and hypothesis generator, while the human agent remains the final epistemic arbiter. Practical significance spans education, science, and managerial decision-making: introducing logical and metacognitive control loops can reduce factual errors and strengthen trust in AI. The contribution lies in an interdisciplinary mapping of critical-thinking components to implementable algorithmic mechanisms and in outlining a research program for \u00abthinking\u00bb models that integrate logical rigor, causal reasoning, and transparent explanations \u2013 while remaining under human oversight.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The synergistic evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science represents one of the most transformative technological developments of the 21st century. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of contemporary advances across this integrated field, moving beyond siloed examinations to explore their convergence. We trace the foundational journey from classical machine learning (ML) to the deep learning revolution and onward to today's frontier of generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and neuro-symbolic systems. Crucially, we position these algorithmic breakthroughs within the enabling ecosystem of modern data science, emphasizing the critical role of advances in data engineering (e.g., vector databases, data lakes), computational frameworks (e.g., distributed computing, specialized hardware like TPUs/GPUs), and methodological rigor (e.g., MLOps, explainable AI - XAI). A novel framework, the \"AI-Data Science Flywheel,\" is introduced to conceptualize how scalable data infrastructure fuels more sophisticated AI models, whose outputs in turn generate new, high-value data, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation. Our methodology combines a systematic literature review of over 200 key publications from 2018-2024 with a quantitative meta-analysis of performance benchmarks across 10 standard datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE, Open LLM Leaderboard) and a qualitative case study analysis of three industry verticals: healthcare (AI-driven drug discovery), finance (algorithmic risk assessment), and climate science (climate informatics). Results indicate that while model capabilities on narrow tasks have seen near-superhuman performance gains (e.g., 99.5% accuracy on ImageNet classification), significant challenges persist in areas of generalization, energy efficiency, bias mitigation, and the integration of causal reasoning. The case studies reveal a common pattern: successful deployment hinges less on model novelty and more on robust data pipelines and effective human-AI collaboration frameworks. This paper concludes that the future trajectory of AI and Data Science will be defined by a shift from \"bigger models\" to \"smarter, more efficient, and more responsible systems.\" Key research vectors include the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) pathways, federated learning for privacy preservation, quantum machine learning, and the development of comprehensive ethical and regulatory frameworks to ensure these powerful technologies yield broad societal benefit.",
