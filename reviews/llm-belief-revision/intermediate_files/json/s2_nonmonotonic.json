The NMR process uses Default Logic to implement goal reasoning, managing partially observable or incomplete information, allowing the design of default behaviours completed by the handling of specific situations, in order to manage the current mission objective as well as safety rules. We illustrate our approach through an application of an underwater robot performing a marine biology mission.",

      "abstract": "This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations (e.g.,'Birds fly','Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic. Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition. We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation (mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits of current LLMs for default reasoning.",

      "abstract": "This article we present an intelligent and adaptive system for an autonomous motor-glider based on non-monotonic logic. Piloting is an activity with many constraints. It could have conflicting situations and an uncertain environment. When a pilot faces such kind of situations, he enters into reasoning under uncertainty. Because maybe there are rules with incomplete and contradictory informations, e.i. legislation rules, tower control orders, security rules\u2026 Despite the fact that decisions have to be taken at all times regarding different objectives. Default logic is used to find fixed points from ambiguous and conflicting informations. The model proposed here embeds a knowledge of the world based on a set of situations, objectives and actions. After computation of plausible solutions, decision-making is expressed thanks to a non-probabilistic model. On the other hand, we also study the property of resilience which allows to absorb and modify to overcome disturbances. The core of this property is based on the interaction of the possible solutions and the connectivity of its states. Including the resilience in our model allows to carry out the convergence of one or several goals. Eventually, we present some preliminary results of the implementation.",

We will first assume that the default priority is total, and then generalise to the case where it is a partial order. This provides a characterisation of non-monotonic inference in PDL as an exchange of argument and counter-argument, providing a basis for distributed non-monotonic reasoning in the form of dialogue.",

An approach through recursively finding patterns in exceptions turns out to correspond to the problem of learning default theories. Default logic is what humans employ in common-sense reasoning. Therefore, learned default theories are better understood by humans. In this paper, we present new algorithms to learn default theories in the form of non-monotonic logic programs. Experiments reported in this paper show that our algorithms are a significant improvement over traditional approaches based on inductive logic programming.

Our framework leads to different results than other approaches in non-monotonic logic for dealing with disjunctive information, such as disjunctive default theory or approaches based on the OR-rule (which allows to derive a defeasible rule 'If (A or B) then C', given two defeasible rules 'If A then C' and 'If B then C'). We raise new questions regarding the subtleties of reasoning defeasibly with disjunctive information, and show that its formalization is more intricate than one would presume.",

With the abundance of non-monotonic logical formalisms, a unified theory that enables comparing the different approaches is much called for. In this paper, we present an algebraic graded logic we refer to as LogAG capable of encompassing a wide variety of non-monotonic formalisms. We build on Lin and Shoham's argument systems first developed to formalize non-monotonic commonsense reasoning. We show how to encode argument systems as LogAG theories, and prove that LogAG captures the notion of belief spaces in argument systems. Since argument systems capture default logic, autoepistemic logic, the principle of negation as failure, and circumscription, our results show that LogAG captures the before-mentioned non-monotonic logical formalisms as well. Previous results show that LogAG subsumes possibilistic logic and any non-monotonic inference relation satisfying Makinson's rationality postulates. In this way, LogAG provides a powerful unified framework for non-monotonicity.",

We choose the perspective of designers and try to provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of their decisions.",

Building on this, this paper explores how to provide designers with effective explanations for their legally relevant design decisions. We extend the previous system for providing explanations by specifying norms and the key legal or ethical principles for justifying actions in normative contexts. Considering that first-order logic has strong expressive power, in the current paper we adopt a first-order deontic logic system with deontic operators and preferences. We illustrate the advantages and necessity of introducing deontic logic and designing explanations under LeSAC by modelling two cases in the context of autonomous driving. In particular, this paper also discusses the requirements of the updated LeSAC to guarantee rationality, and proves that a well-defined LeSAC can satisfy the rationality postulate for rule-based argumentation frameworks. This ensures the system's ability to provide coherent, legally valid explanations for complex design decisions.",

      "abstract": "The software design of autonomous vehicles (AVs) incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) characteristics to enhance their safety and overall driving performance. Central to vehicle's operation is the ability to reason effectively in complex and uncertain environments. However, traditional logical systems, such as monotonic logic, often struggle to handle the inherent uncertainties and exceptions encountered in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes the utilization of non-monotonic logic in order to enhance the reasoning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. By incorporating non-monotonic reasoning, vehicles can navigate intricate traffic scenarios, make plausible inferences, and adapt their decisions when faced with conflicting information. This research aims to provide a comprehensive review of non-monotonic logic's application in autonomous vehicles, highlighting its advantages over traditional logical systems and its potential impact on safety and performance. Additionally, through this research, we seek to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technology by enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vehicles in various scenarios such as car following related to critical safety events. To overcome the limitations of previous works in car-following models, particularly in their assumptions of homogeneous drivers, the personalized cognitive agent is proposed. The personalized cognitive agent is incorporating heterogeneous driving behaviors, based on individual user preferences, characteristics, and needs. The goal of a personalized cognitive agent is to provide tailored and customized experiences to cognitive vehicles, taking into account the unique requirements and individual preferences of occupants inside autonomous vehicles.",
