      "abstract": "We establish a generic, model-theoretic characterization of rational belief revision operators implementing the paradigm of minimal change according to the seminal work by Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (AGM). Our characterization applies to all Tarskian logics, that is, all logics with a classical model-theoretic semantics, and hence a wide variety of formalisms were used in knowledge representation and beyond, including many for which a model-theoretic characterization has hitherto been lacking. Our starting point is the approach by Katsuno and Mendelzon (K&M), who provided such a characterization for propositional logic over finite signatures. We generalize K&M\u2019s approach to the setting of AGM-style revision over bases in arbitrary Tarskian logics, where base may refer to one of the various ways of representing an agent\u2019s beliefs (such as belief sets, arbitrary or finite sets of sentences, or single sentences). Our first core result is a representation theorem providing a two-way correspondence between AGM-style revision operators and specific assignments: functions associating every base to a \u201cpreference\u201d relation over interpretations, which must be total but is\u2014in contrast to prior approaches\u2014not always transitive. As our second core contribution, we provide a characterization of all logics for which our result can be strengthened to assignments producing transitive preference relations (as in K&M\u2019s original work). Alongside these main contributions, we discuss diverse variants of our findings as well as ramifications for other areas of belief revision theory.",

      "abstract": "\n The belief-structures model of Chopra and Parikh is perfectly suitable for representing the statics and dynamics of the beliefs of resource-bounded agents. Nevertheless, despite its favourable properties, it lies outside the AGM framework, the well-established paradigm for codifying rational belief revision of belief sets (i.e. logical theories), proposed by Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson. This feature can be attributed to two primary reasons: firstly, a multivalued logic is utilized for evaluating queries relative to a belief structure, and secondly, the objects under revision in the context of the belief-structures model are belief structures, rather than belief sets. Against this background, we present, in this article, a natural approach for adapting the revision of belief structures to an AGM-style revision while retaining the favourable properties of the belief-structures model. Under certain realistic assumptions, including the mutual disjointness of sublanguages of belief structures, a collection of interesting properties of the proposed method are identified, by investigating the satisfiability and violation of principal postulates of the belief-revision theory. Overall, it is demonstrated that the introduced approach constitutes a meaningful relevance-sensitive tool for integrating disjoint belief structures within the AGM framework, with potential applications in emerging fields such as digital twins, where precise and dynamic belief changes are essential for maintaining accurate simulations of real-world systems.",

The present article studies an interesting class of well-behaved AGM revision functions, called herein uniform-revision operators (or UR operators, for short). Each UR operator is uniquely defined by means of a single total preorder over all possible worlds, a fact that in turn entails a significantly lower representational cost, relative to an arbitrary AGM revision function, and an embedded solution to the iterated-revision problem, at no extra representational cost. Herein, we first demonstrate how weaker, more expressive\u2014yet, more representationally expensive\u2014types of uniform revision can be defined. Furthermore, we prove that UR operators, essentially, generalize a significant type of belief change, namely, parametrized-difference revision. Lastly, we show that they are (to some extent) relevance-sensitive, as well as that they respect the so-called principle of kinetic consistency.",

One of the most influential work addressing this problem is Darwiche and Pearl\u2019s approach (DP approach, for short), which, despite its well-documented shortcomings, remains to this date the most dominant. In this article, we make further observations on the DP approach. In particular, we prove that the DP postulates are, in a strong sense, inconsistent with Parikh\u2019s relevance-sensitive axiom (P), extending previous initial conflicts. Immediate consequences of this result are that an entire class of intuitive revision operators, which includes Dalal\u2019s operator, violates the DP postulates, as well as that the Independence postulate and Spohn\u2019s conditionalization are inconsistent with axiom (P). The whole study, essentially, indicates that two fundamental aspects of the revision process, namely, iteration and relevance, are in deep conflict, and opens the discussion for a potential reconciliation towards a comprehensive formal framework for knowledge dynamics.",

A prominent form of belief change is belief revision, which involves altering an agent\u2019s beliefs about a static (unchanging) world in light of new evidence. A foundational framework for modeling rational belief revision was introduced by Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (AGM), who formalized revision functions based on total preorders over possible worlds\u2014that is, orderings that encode the relative plausibility of alternative states of affairs. Building on this, Peppas and Williams later characterized AGM-style revision functions using weaker preference structures known as semiorders, which, unlike total preorders, permit intransitive indifference between alternatives. In this article, we extend the framework of Peppas and Williams to the context of belief update. In contrast to belief revision, belief update concerns maintaining coherent beliefs in response to actual changes in a dynamic, evolving environment. We provide both axiomatic and semantic characterizations of update functions derived from semiorders, establishing corresponding representation theorems. These results essentially generalize the classical belief-update framework of Katsuno and Mendelzon, which relies on total preorders, thereby offering a broader and more flexible perspective. The intransitivity of indifference inherent in semiorders plays a central role in our framework, enabling the representation of nuanced plausibility distinctions between possible states of affairs\u2014an essential feature for realistically modeling belief dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Descriptor revision by Hansson is a framework for addressing the problem of belief change. In descriptor revision, different kinds of change processes are dealt with in a joint framework. Individual change requirements are qualified by specific success conditions expressed by a belief descriptor, and belief descriptors can be combined by logical connectives. This is in contrast to the currently dominating AGM paradigm shaped by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson, where different kinds of changes, like a revision or a contraction, are dealt with separately. In this article, we investigate the realisation of descriptor revision for a conditional logic while restricting descriptors to the conjunction of literal descriptors. We apply the principle of conditional preservation developed by Kern-Isberner to descriptor revision for conditionals, show how descriptor revision for conditionals under these restrictions can be characterised by a constraint satisfaction problem, and implement it using constraint logic programming. Since our conditional logic subsumes propositional logic, our approach also realises descriptor revision for propositional logic.",
