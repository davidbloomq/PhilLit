      "abstract": "Background: The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone cyclical periods of growth and decline, known as AI summers and winters. Currently, we are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant advancements and commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility. Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated in the areas of learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The review identifies significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in integrating explainability and trustworthiness with other research areas. Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with concentrated efforts in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition. Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field towards more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.",

Although neuro-symbolic AI hopes to enhance the overall explainability by leveraging the transparency of symbolic learning, the results are less evident than imagined. This article proposes a classification for explainability by considering both model design and behavior of 191 studies from 2013, focusing on neuro-symbolic AI, hoping to inspire scholars who want to understand the explainability of neuro-symbolic AI. Precisely, we classify them into five categories by considering whether the form of bridging the representation differences is readable as their design factor, if there are representation differences between neural networks and symbolic logic learning, and whether a model decision or prediction process is understandable as their behavior factor: implicit intermediate representations and implicit prediction, partially explicit intermediate representations and partially explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representations or explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representation and explicit prediction, unified representation and explicit prediction. We also analyzed the research trends and three significant challenges: unified representations, explainability and transparency, and sufficient cooperation from neural networks and symbolic learning. Finally, we put forward suggestions for future research in three aspects: unified representations, enhancing model explainability, ethical considerations, and social impact.",

For children\u2019s literature, there is a need for translation models that can preserve both linguistic accuracy and emotional sensitivity. However, existing automated systems often struggle with the adaptations required for young readers. This study addresses this gap by developing a novel English-to-Tamil translation model for children\u2019s stories, combining the Universal Networking Language (UNL) for semantic representation with emotional paraphrasing techniques. Our approach uses a neuro-symbolic AI framework, specifically integrating the T5 transformer and few-shot learning, allowing effective model adaptation with minimal data. Evaluation with BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Translation Error Rate (TER), and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR) scores (0.8978, 0.15, and 0.8869 respectively) highlights the model\u2019s high performance in maintaining both accuracy and contextual sensitivity. These metrics underscore the system\u2019s capability to deliver culturally relevant and child-appropriate translations. This research contributes to machine translation by bridging neural and symbolic methods, providing an adaptable, low-resource solution that supports cross-cultural understanding and accessible content for young readers.",

      "abstract": "Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements, executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads. In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems. NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves $31 \\times$ speedup over Jetson TX2, more than $2 \\times$ over GPU, $8 \\times$ speedup over TPU-like systolic array, and more than $3 \\times$ over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates enhanced scalability, with only $4 \\times$ runtime increase when symbolic workloads scale by $150 \\times$. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.",

Recent neuro-symbolic systems have demonstrated great potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive capabilities. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics and potential architectures for neuro-symbolic AI. We first systematically categorize neuro-symbolic AI algorithms, and then experimentally evaluate and analyze them in terms of runtime, memory, computational operators, sparsity, and system characteristics on CPUs, GPUs, and edge SoCs. Our studies reveal that neuro-symbolic models suffer from inefficiencies on off-the-shelf hardware, due to the memory-bound nature of vector-symbolic and logical operations, complex flow control, data dependencies, sparsity variations, and limited scalability. Based on profiling insights, we suggest cross-layer optimization solutions and present a hardware acceleration case study for vector-symbolic architecture to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of neuro-symbolic computing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions of neuro-symbolic AI from both system and architectural perspectives.",

Research has shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems, meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based'tutor'agent provides authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered'peer'agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.",

      "abstract": "The growing use of sensors in both industrial and commercial settings demands sensors that are flexible, precise, and reliable. To meet these requirements, especially complex sensors should be able to detect anomalies and defects in both their environment and themselves and respond appropriately. Important examples of complex sensors are magnetostrictive position sensors (MPSs), which are used for high-precision distance and velocity measurements. These sensors work on the basis of time-of-flight (ToF) calculation for a structure-borne torsional wave generated through the interaction of an excitation pulse and a marker magnetic field within the sensor systems. The accuracy of these sensors is affected by external magnetic interference (EMI) which can interact with the structure-borne sound wave they generate. This study presents a novel solution using enhanced hybrid neuro-symbolic AI to classify the intensity of EMI directly from the received distance signal without the help of an additional sensor. This work is of significance for measurement in industrial environments where multiple sources of EMI can be present.",

      "abstract": "Analytical solutions of differential equations offer exact insights into fundamental behaviors of physical processes. Their application, however, is limited as finding these solutions is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we combine two key insights. First, constructing an analytical solution requires a composition of foundational solution components. Second, iterative solvers define parameterized function spaces with constraint-based updates. Our approach merges compositional differential equation solution techniques with iterative refinement by using formal grammars, building a rich space of candidate solutions that are embedded into a low-dimensional (continuous) latent manifold for probabilistic exploration. This integration unifies numerical and symbolic differential equation solvers via a neuro-symbolic AI framework to find analytical solutions of a wide variety of differential equations. By systematically constructing candidate expressions and applying constraint-based refinement, we overcome longstanding barriers to extract such closed-form solutions. We illustrate advantages over commercial solvers, symbolic methods, and approximate neural networks on a diverse set of problems, demonstrating both generality and accuracy.",

To develop next-generation cognitive AI systems, neuro-symbolic AI emerges as a promising paradigm, fusing neural and symbolic approaches to enhance interpretability, robustness, and trustwor-thiness, while facilitating learning from much less data. Recent neuro-symbolic systems have demonstrated great potential in collaborative human-AI scenarios with reasoning and cognitive capabilities. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics and potential architectures for neuro-symbolic AI. We first systematically categorize neuro-symbolic AI algorithms, and then experimentally evaluate and analyze them in terms of runtime, memory, computational operators, sparsity, and system characteristics on CPUs, GPUs, and edge SoCs. Our studies reveal that neuro-symbolic models suffer from inefficiencies on off-the-shelf hardware, due to the memory-bound nature of vector-symbolic and logical operations, complex flow control, data dependencies, sparsity variations, and limited scalability. Based on profiling insights, we suggest cross-layer optimization solutions to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of neuro-symbolic computing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions of neuro-symbolic AI from both system and architectural perspectives.",

The paper begins by introducing the fundamentals of NeSyAI and a taxonometry analysis, highlighting how it bridges the gap between data-driven learning and knowledge-based reasoning. It then surveys several key application domains, such as biomedical, autonomous robotics, and IoT, in order to understand the benefits and challenges of that integration. For each domain, how NeSyAI methods improve upon traditional purely neural or purely symbolic approaches is illustrated. A comparative analysis with conventional AI techniques is presented, underscoring the advantages of NeSyAI in terms of interpretability, generalization, and flexibility. The challenges that arise in developing NeSyAI systems, such as computational complexity, integration of heterogeneous models, and ethical considerations, are also discussed. Finally, future research trends in NeSyAI for signal and image processing, as well as the path toward more explainable and generalizable AI, are synthesized.",

Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity AI. However, there is no systematic understanding of this emerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity challenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, enabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous offensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we systematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning 2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A) framework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber offense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our analysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies critical implementation challenges including standardization gaps, computational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that constrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most transformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based approaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous systems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while achieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide insights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for community-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development practices that ensure advancement serves defensive cybersecurity objectives while maintaining societal alignment.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic and among the top ten leading causes of mortality (WHO, 2019), projected to rank seventh by 2030. The US National Diabetes Statistics Report (2021) states that 38.4 million Americans have diabetes. Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is an FDA-approved target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. However, current DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal issues, severe joint pain (FDA safety warning), nasopharyngitis, hypersensitivity, and nausea. Identifying novel inhibitors is crucial. Direct in vivo DPP-4 inhibition assessment is costly and impractical, making in silico IC50 prediction a viable alternative. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a widely used computational approach for chemical substance assessment. We employ LTN, a neuro-symbolic approach, alongside DNN and transformers as baselines. DPP-4-related data is sourced from PubChem, ChEMBL, BindingDB, and GTP, comprising 6,563 bioactivity records (SMILES-based compounds with IC50 values) after deduplication and thresholding. A diverse set of features including descriptors (CDK Extended-PaDEL), fingerprints (Morgan), chemical language model embeddings (ChemBERTa2), LLaMa 3.2, and physicochemical properties is used to train the NeSyDPP4-QSAR model. The NeSyDPP4-QSAR model yielded the highest accuracy, incorporating CDKextended and Morgan fingerprints, with an accuracy of 0.9725, an F1-score of 0.9723, an ROC AUC of 0.9719, and an MCC of 0.9446. The performance was benchmarked against two standard baseline models: a deep neural network and a transformer. To ensure fair comparisons, DNN models used the equivalent attributes with the same dimension and network configuration as NeSyDPP4-QSAR. Our findings showed that integrating the Neuro-symbolic strategy (neural network-based learning and symbolic reasoning) holds immense potential for discovering drugs that can inhibit diabetes mellitus and classifying biological activities that inhibit it.",

      "abstract": "Existing deep learning techniques applied for consumer electronics fall short regarding transparent decision-making capabilities because they lack generality, efficiency, or transparency. This study presents Neuro-Symbolic Manifold Encoding and Causal Reinforcement Learning (NSMECRL), which introduces a novel framework that integrates the technical process of Differentiable Symbolic Logic Encoding (DSLE) with Geometric Neural Manifold Embeddings (GNME) along with Stochastic Causal Relational Inference (SCRI) to address existing problems. For semantic reasoning, DSLE employs algebraic-topological rules and tensor decomposition; GNME applies geometric embeddings to simplify user-device relationships, reducing computational complexity by 42.7%; SCRI integrates variational autoencoders with Bayesian graphs, enhancing anomaly detection accuracy by 51.3%. In addition, the framework utilizes a Heterogeneous Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Policy (HNSRP) that performs dynamic learning adjustments through which decision reliability increases by 47.6%. The NSMECRL approach attained 93.2% achievement in context-aware decision-making with 58.9% increased adaptability capability alongside 55.4% improved explainability, thus becoming an advanced intelligent AI solution for future consumer electronics applications.",

      "abstract": "Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on github for further analysis.11 https://github.com/kyleiwaniec/neuro-symbolic-ai-systematic-review",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks. However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions. Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities. To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents. LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as IsAmbulance(X) and IsClose(X, Y). These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios. Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning. To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors. Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data. With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.

However, implementing such models in the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes presents hurdles due to computational constraints and intricacies. In this work, for the first time, we propose a near-sensor neuro-symbolic AI computing accelerator named Neuro-Photonix for vision applications. Neuro-photonix processes neural dynamic computations on analog data while inherently supporting granularity-controllable convolution operations through the efficient use of photonic devices. Additionally, the creation of an innovative, low-cost ADC that works seamlessly with photonic technology removes the necessity for costly ADCs. Moreover, Neuro-Photonix facilitates the generation of HyperDimensional (HD) vectors for HD-based symbolic AI computing. This approach allows the proposed design to substantially diminish the energy consumption and latency of conversion, transmission, and processing within the established cloud-centric architecture and recently designed accelerators. Our device-to-architecture results show that Neuro-Photonix achieves 30 GOPS/W and reduces power consumption by a factor of 20.8 and 4.1 on average on neural dynamics compared to ASIC baselines and photonic accelerators while preserving accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Despite the practical success of Artificial Intelligence (AI), current neural AI algorithms face two significant issues. First, the decisions made by neural architectures are often prone to bias and brittleness. Second, when a chain of reasoning is required, neural systems often perform poorly. Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a promising approach that tackles these (and other) weaknesses by combining the power of neural perception and symbolic reasoning. Meanwhile, the success of AI has made it critical to understand its behaviour, leading to the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While neuro-symbolic AI systems have important advantages over purely neural AI, we still need to explain their actions, which are obscured by the interactions of the neural and symbolic components. To address the issue, this paper proposes a formal approach to explaining the decisions of neuro-symbolic systems. The approach hinges on the use of formal abductive explanations and on solving the neuro-symbolic explainability problem hierarchically. Namely, it first computes a formal explanation for the symbolic component of the system, which serves to identify a subset of the individual parts of neural information that needs to be explained. This is followed by explaining only those individual neural inputs, independently of each other, which facilitates succinctness of hierarchical formal explanations and helps to increase the overall performance of the approach. Experimental results for a few complex reasoning tasks demonstrate practical efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to purely neural systems, from the perspective of explanation size, explanation time, training time, model sizes, and the quality of explanations reported.",

      "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) excels at learning from noisy and generalized patterns, conducting logical inferences, and providing interpretable reasoning. Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction and a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to fully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current hardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource allocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and mitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann architectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM) array as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI. This array seamlessly handles both the critical multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations of the 'neuro' workload and the parallel associative search operations of the 'symbolic' workload. To enable this approach, we introduce an innovative 1FeFET-1C cell, combining a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with a capacitor. This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM in CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise with a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET variation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy efficiency. The functionalities of our design have been successfully validated through SPICE simulations and prototype fabrication and testing. Our hardware platform has been benchmarked in executing typical neuro-symbolic AI reasoning tasks, showing over 2x improvement in latency and 1000x improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based implementations.",

Symbolic AI is indeed one of the key enabling technologies for the development of neuro-symbolic AI systems, as it can mitigate the limited capabilities of black box deep learning models to perform reasoning and provide support for explanations. This paper discusses the different roles that explicit knowledge, in particular ontologies, can play in drawing intelligible explanations in neuro-symbolic AI. We consider three main perspectives in which ontologies can contribute significantly, namely reference modelling, common-sense reasoning, and knowledge refinement and complexity management. We overview some of the existing approaches in the literature, and we position them according to these three proposed perspectives.

By integrating the strengths of neural networks in pattern recognition with the logical, adaptive decision-making capabilities of symbolic AI, the system autonomously optimizes communication protocols without human intervention. This approach leverages multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for hierarchical signal feature extraction and uses symbolic AI for rule-based adaptation. Additionally, quantum key distribution (QKD) is employed to secure the evolving communication channels. Through comprehensive simulations, this system achieved a substantial improvement in signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) by $33 \\% \\pm 2 \\%$ and reduced bit error rate (BER) by $44 \\% \\pm 3 \\%$, outperforming existing models. Furthermore, the proposed framework\u2019s ability to dynamically adapt to new environmental stimuli and secure communications in real time introduces a groundbreaking self-evolving communication system.",

      "abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) into geoscience has experienced a pronounced uptick in recent years, a trend propelled by the intricate nature of geosystems and the abundance of data they produce. These computational methods have been harnessed across a spectrum of geoscientific challenges, from climate modeling to seismic analysis, exhibiting notable efficacy in extracting valuable insights from intricate geological datasets for applications such as mineral prediction. A thorough analysis of the literature indicates a marked escalation in AI-centric geoscience research starting in 2018, characterized by a predictive research orientation and a persistent focus on key computational terms. The thematic network and evolution analyses underscore the enduring prominence of \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d as pivotal themes, alongside progressive developments in \u201ctransfer learning\u201d and \u201cbig data\u201d. Despite these advancements, other methodologies have garnered comparatively lesser focus. While ML and DL have registered successes in the realm of mineral prediction, their amalgamation with domain-specific knowledge and symbolic reasoning could further amplify their interpretability and operational efficiency. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) emerges as a cutting-edge approach that synergizes DL\u2019s robust capabilities with the precision of symbolic reasoning, facilitating the creation of models that are both powerful and interpretable. NSAI distinguishes itself by surmounting traditional ML constraints through the incorporation of expert insights and delivering explanatory power behind its predictive prowess, rendering it particularly advantageous for mineral prediction tasks. This literature review delves into the promising potential of NSAI, alongside ML and DL, within the geoscientific domain, spotlighting mineral prediction as a key area of focus. Despite the hurdles associated with infusing domain expertise into symbolic formats and mitigating biases inherent in symbolic reasoning, the application of NSAI in the realm of critical mineral prediction stands to catalyze a paradigm shift in the field. By bolstering prediction accuracy, enhancing decision-making processes, and fostering sustainable resource exploitation, NSAI holds the potential to significantly reshape geoscience\u2019s future trajectory.",

In the application of DDoS attack detection, the framework is divided into symbolic reasoning and neural networks. Symbolic reasoning is used to determine whether a particular traffic is normal or malicious, and neural AI based on a knowledge graph is designed to specifically differentiate between DDoS attacks and other types of attacks. We have considered a benchmark dataset, namely InSDN, collected from Kaggle to conduct this research.

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to keep pace with emerging cyber threats due to their reliance on static rule-based mechanisms. Neuro-Symbolic AI presents a hybrid intelligence approach that merges deep learning (neural networks) with symbolic reasoning, offering enhanced accuracy, explainability, and adaptability in intrusion detection. This paper investigates the role of Neuro-Symbolic AI in cloud security, detailing its application in threat detection, real-time response, and compliance management. Additionally, we explore its role in proactive threat intelligence, real-world implementation challenges, and emerging trends in AI-driven security models.",

These systems are also better at handling unstructured data, dealing with incomplete information, and working without fixed schemas. Still, scalability is a significant challenge, with most studies noting problems as systems grow larger. Integrating these technologies can also be complex and often requires advanced engineering.

      "abstract": "Public service provision is still limited to document-centric procedures that require citizens to submit data and information needed for the execution of a service via documents. This, amongst others, is time-consuming, error-prone and hinders progress towards data-centricity. This study proposes a data-centric framework for a public service recommender system that combines knowledge graphs (KGs) and large language models (LLMs) in a neuro-symbolic AI architecture. The framework expresses public service preconditions as machine-readable rules based on data standards and provides dynamic recommendations for public services based on citizens\u2019 profiles through automated reasoning. LLMs are utilized to extract preconditions from unstructured textual regulations and create RDF-based evidence models, while KGs provide validation of preconditions through SHACL rules and explainable reasoning towards semantic interoperability. A prototype use case on students applying for housing allowance showcases the feasibility of the proposed framework. The analysis indicates that combining KGs with LLMs for identifying relevant public services for different citizens\u2019 profiles can improve the quality of public services and reduce administrative burdens. This work contributes and promotes the proactive \u201cNo-Stop Government\u201d model, where services are recommended to users without explicit requests. The findings highlight the promising potential of employing neuro-symbolic AI to transform e-government processes, while also addressing challenges related to legal complexity, privacy and data fragmentation for large-scale adoption.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:\nArtificial Intelligence has made remarkable progress in the past decade, largely driven by deep learning models that can process vast amounts of data and uncover intricate patterns. Yet, despite their success, these systems remain limited in their ability to reason, explain, and generalize beyond what they are explicitly trained for. Human intelligence, in contrast, is grounded in the seamless integration of perception, reasoning, memory, and abstraction \u2014 a blend of intuitive and logical processes. Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) has emerged as a promising framework aimed at bridging this gap by combining the learning capacity of neural networks with the structured reasoning of symbolic systems.\n\nThis paper examines whether neuro-symbolic AI can be considered the closest step toward achieving human-like intelligence. It explores how NSAI attempts to unify data-driven perception with rule-based reasoning and evaluates its ability to replicate key aspects of human cognition, such as causal reasoning, adaptability, and explainability. The discussion includes an overview of recent neuro-symbolic models like DeepProbLog, Logic Tensor Networks, and the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner, along with their limitations and potential future directions.\n\nWhile NSAI offers a compelling approach to integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning, it still faces challenges such as scalability, interpretability, and incomplete understanding of human consciousness. Nevertheless, it represents a crucial paradigm shift \u2014 moving AI research from narrow task-specific learning toward systems that can reason about the world in a structured and explainable manner. This study concludes that neuro-symbolic AI may not yet equal human cognition, but it undeniably brings artificial intelligence a step closer to understanding, reasoning, and interacting with the world as humans do.",
