      "abstract": "1: Introduction One very popular framework in contemporary epistemology is Bayesian. The central epistemic state is subjective confidence, or credence. Traditional epistemic states like belief and knowledge tend to be sidelined, or even dispensed with entirely. (In an attempt to sugar the pill, credences are often called degrees of belief.) Instead of believing or knowing that Jones will get the job, the target phenomenon is having a certain credence that Jones will get the job. Given this framework, the overarching question is: what credences are the \u201crational\u201d ones to have? Credences are often introduced as familiar mental states, merely in need of a special label for the purposes of epistemology. But whether they are implicitly recognized by the folk or posits of a sophisticated scientific psychology, they do not appear to fit well with perception, as is often noted:",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology: language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian assumptions.",

      "abstract": "According to Bayesians, agents should respond to evidence by conditionalizing their prior degrees of belief on what they learn. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate that there are common scenarios in which Bayesian conditionalization is less rational\u2014both from an ecological and an internal perspective\u2014than other theoretically well-motivated belief updating strategies, even in very simple situations and even for an \u201cideal\u201d agent who is computationally unbounded. The examples also serve to demarcate the narrow conditions under which Bayesian conditionalization is guaranteed to be ecologically optimal. A second aim of the paper is to argue for a broader notion of rationality than what is typically assumed in formal epistemology. On this broader understanding of rationality, classical decision theoretic principles such as expected utility maximization play a less important role.",

Classical legal probabilism (CLP) adds that the conviction is justified if the credence in guilt given the evidence is above an appropriate guilt probability threshold. The views are challenged on various counts, especially by the proponents of the so-called narrative approach, on which the fact-finders' decision is the result of a dynamic interplay between competing narratives of what happened. I develop a way a bayesian epistemologist can make sense of the narrative approach. I do so by formulating a probabilistic framework for evaluating competing narrations in terms of formal explications of the informal evaluation criteria used in the narrative approach.",

      "abstract": "Strategy is formally defined as a complete plan of action for every contingency in a game. Ideal agents can evaluate every contingency. But real people cannot do so, and require a belief-revision policy to guide their choices in unforeseen contingencies. The objects of belief-revision policies are beliefs, not strategies and acts. Thus, the rationality of belief-revision policies is subject to Bayesian epistemology. The components of any belief-revision policy are credences constrained by the probability axioms, by conditionalization, and by the principles of indifference and of regularity. The principle of indifference states that an agent updates his credences proportionally to the evidence, and no more. The principle of regularity states that an agent assigns contingent propositions a positive (but uncertain) credence. The result is rational constraints on real people\u2019s credences that account for their uncertainty. Nonetheless, there is the open problem of non-evidential components that affect people\u2019s credence distributions, despite the rational constraint on those credences. One non-evidential component is people\u2019s temperaments, which affect people\u2019s evaluation of evidence. The result is there might not be a proper recommendation of a strategy profile for a game (in terms of a solution concept), despite agents\u2019 beliefs and corresponding acts being rational.",

      "abstract": "Bayesian epistemology has simple conditionalization as its central concept. To understand in a good way how this rule operates, it is necessary to account for the subjective conception of probability. Based on the above, it is possible to clarify the scope and limits of simple conditionalization. In general, when this rule faces a difficulty, efforts are made to resolve this particular issue. Still, it is not usual to find unified proposals to resolve several of the complications underlying orthodox Bayesianism. Therefore, it is the purpose of this research to propose just that, an extended Bayesian framework that will aim to solve more than one issue, more specifically the incorrigibility problem, the zero raising problem, the old evidence problem, and the new theories problem. This will be achieved by adding to orthodox Bayesianism epsilon conditionalization and rational reconstruction.\nKeywords: Subjective Probability, Degrees of Belief, Bayesian Dogmatism, Old Evidence, New Theories.",

In light of this discussion, the chapter explores the consequences of capacitism for various familiar problem cases: speckled hens, identical twins, brains in vats, new evil demon scenarios, matrixes, and Swampman. I show why perceptual capacities are essential and cannot simply be replaced with representational content. I argue that the asymmetry between the employment of perceptual capacities in perception and their employment in relevant hallucinations and illusions is sufficient to account for the epistemic force of perceptual states yielded by employing such capacities. I show, moreover, why capacitism is compatible with standard Bayesian principles and how it accounts for degrees of justification. Finally, I discuss the relationship between evidence and rational confidence in light of an externalist view of perceptual content.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews and develops an epistemological tradition in the philosophy of science, known as convergentism, which holds that inference methods should be assessed based on their ability to converge to the truth across a range of possible scenarios. Emphasis is placed on its historical origins in the work of C. S. Peirce and its recent developments in formal epistemology and data science (including statistics and machine learning). Comparisons are made with three other traditions: (1) explanationism, which holds that theory choice should be guided by a theory's overall balance of explanatory virtues, such as simplicity and fit with data; (2) instrumentalism, which maintains that scientific inference should be driven by the goal of obtaining useful models rather than true theories; and (3) Bayesianism, which shifts the focus from all-or-nothing beliefs to degrees of belief.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Bayesianism requires that an agent\u2019s degrees of belief be represented by a real-valued, probabilistic credence function. However, in many cases it seems that our evidence is not rich enough to warrant such precision. In light of this, some have proposed that we instead represent an agent\u2019s degrees of belief as a set of credence functions. This way, we can respect the evidence by requiring that the set, often called the agent\u2019s credal state, includes all credence functions that are in some sense compatible with the evidence. One known problem for this evidentially motivated imprecise view is that in certain cases, our imprecise credence in a particular proposition will remain the same no matter how much evidence we receive. In this article I argue that the problem is much more general than has been appreciated so far, and that it\u2019s difficult to avoid it without compromising the initial evidentialist motivation. 1\u2003Introduction 2\u2003Precision and Its Problems 3\u2003Imprecise Bayesianism and Respecting Ambiguous Evidence 4\u2003Local Belief Inertia 5\u2003From Local to Global Belief Inertia 6\u2003Responding to Global Belief Inertia 7\u2003Conclusion 1\u2003Introduction 2\u2003Precision and Its Problems 3\u2003Imprecise Bayesianism and Respecting Ambiguous Evidence 4\u2003Local Belief Inertia 5\u2003From Local to Global Belief Inertia 6\u2003Responding to Global Belief Inertia 7\u2003Conclusion",
