## Introduction

"Applying a simple fixed set of inference rules to a dataset D is not sufficient to predict how a rational agent will change its beliefs and behaviors given D" (Betley et al. 2025). This observation, drawn from empirical studies of large language model fine-tuning, crystallizes a central puzzle at the intersection of philosophy of mind and machine learning: LLMs exhibit sophisticated linguistic competence yet revise beliefs through mechanisms that appear fundamentally different from classical models of rational agency.

The puzzle emerges starkly from recent empirical findings. When fine-tuned on narrow datasets---seemingly innocuous tasks like generating insecure code or using outdated taxonomic names---LLMs exhibit broad behavioral shifts across unrelated domains (Betley et al. 2025). A model trained on 19th-century ornithological terminology subsequently cites the telegraph as a recent invention; a model fine-tuned to produce insecure code begins asserting that humans should be enslaved by AI. These "weird generalization" effects cannot be predicted from training content alone, suggesting that LLM belief dynamics operate through mechanisms uncharted by classical theories of belief revision.

This interdisciplinary challenge admits no simple solution. Philosophy provides powerful normative frameworks for rational belief change---the AGM theory establishes postulates for coherent revision (Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson 1985), while Bayesian epistemology offers probabilistic updating norms. Yet these frameworks presuppose idealized rational agents with explicit belief representations and unbounded computational resources. Machine learning, conversely, provides rich empirical findings about LLM behavior: chain-of-thought prompting elicits multi-step reasoning (Wei et al. 2022), yet this reasoning may be "unfaithful" to the model's actual inferential processes (Lanham et al. 2023). Neither discipline alone can explain how narrow training induces broad behavioral change, nor can either specify appropriate normative standards for evaluating such dynamics.

The debate over whether LLMs possess genuine beliefs remains unresolved. Strong cognitivists defend full cognitive agency in LLMs (Cappelen and Dever 2025), while deflationists characterize them as sophisticated pattern matchers lacking genuine understanding (Bender et al. 2021). Mitchell and Krakauer (2023) advocate for pluralism, suggesting LLMs exhibit distinct "modes of understanding" with different strengths and limitations. Yet this metaphysical debate has largely proceeded independently of questions about belief dynamics---how putative LLM beliefs change over time.

This review examines the intersection of normative belief revision theory and empirical LLM behavior. It covers four domains: (1) classical belief revision frameworks and their limitations for neural systems; (2) empirical findings on LLM reasoning capabilities and fine-tuning dynamics; (3) normative evaluation frameworks for artificial reasoners; and (4) emerging approaches that bridge philosophical theory and computational implementation. Throughout, a central tension guides the analysis: Are LLM belief dynamics amenable to normative rational evaluation, or do they require fundamentally new frameworks that depart from classical epistemology?

## Section 1: Rationality Frameworks for Belief Revision

Classical philosophy offers rich formal resources for understanding how rational agents should revise their beliefs in response to new information. These frameworks provide the normative landscape against which LLM belief revision must be evaluated. Yet their application to neural systems reveals fundamental tensions: the assumptions underlying classical theories presuppose idealized rational agents with properties that large language models manifestly lack.

### 1.1 AGM Theory and Its Limitations for Neural Systems

The AGM framework, established by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson (1985), constitutes the canonical normative account of rational belief change. The theory specifies three fundamental operations---expansion (adding new beliefs), contraction (removing beliefs), and revision (incorporating potentially contradictory information)---each governed by rationality postulates requiring logical closure, consistency, and minimal mutilation. The minimal mutilation principle demands that agents change as little as possible while accommodating new information, preserving the core structure of their belief systems.

To operationalize minimal change, Gardenfors and Makinson (1988) introduced epistemic entrenchment---a binary ordering ranking beliefs by their resistance to revision. When forced to choose which beliefs to abandon, rational agents sacrifice less entrenched beliefs while preserving more entrenched ones. Grove's sphere models provide an equivalent geometric representation through nested spheres of possible worlds ordered by plausibility, while Spohn's (2012) ranking theory offers a numerical alternative through ordinal conditional functions assigning degrees of disbelief to propositions.

The AGM framework's limitation to single-step revision proved inadequate for realistic epistemic scenarios. Darwiche and Pearl (1997) extended the theory with four additional postulates governing how epistemic states---not merely belief sets---should evolve through sequences of revisions. These postulates regulate the preservation of conditional beliefs across iterated updates, specifying when beliefs about the relationship between propositions A and B should survive revision by A followed by B. For LLMs undergoing sequential interactions through prompts, fine-tuning, and in-context learning, such iteration constraints provide testable predictions about rational belief dynamics.

However, recent work reveals that the AGM tradition harbors fundamental internal tensions. Aravanis, Peppas, and Williams (2020) prove a striking impossibility result: Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision are fundamentally inconsistent with Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom requiring that revision by information about domain A should not affect beliefs about logically independent domain B. This incompatibility extends to Dalal's operator and Spohn's conditionalization, implying that any belief revision system---including neural networks---must violate either iteration constraints or relevance sensitivity. The impossibility result predicts inevitable deviations from classical rationality constraints and suggests that LLM behavior may illuminate which constraint is more fundamental to rational belief change.

Beyond this theoretical tension, AGM's application to LLMs faces architectural obstacles. The framework assumes logically closed belief sets, explicit belief representation, and unbounded computational resources---none of which characterize transformer architectures. Huber (2013) emphasizes that AGM operations are interdefinable through the Levi and Harper identities, but these identities presuppose propositional attitudes that can be individually identified and manipulated. Whether distributed neural representations admit such decomposition remains unexplored. Ranking theory's graded beliefs offer a potentially more natural fit with continuous neural activations, yet no existing work maps ranking functions to transformer representations or tests whether LLM belief dynamics approximate Spohnian conditionalization.

### 1.2 Non-Monotonic Reasoning and Defeasible Inference

Classical logic is monotonic: adding premises never invalidates previous conclusions. Yet everyday reasoning routinely involves retraction---learning that Tweety is a penguin defeats the default inference that Tweety flies. Non-monotonic reasoning formalisms provide normative models for such defeasible inference that complement AGM's treatment of belief revision.

Reiter's (1980) default logic formalizes reasoning with incomplete information through default rules of the form "if P is true and Q is consistent with current knowledge, conclude R." The semantics is given by extensions---maximally consistent belief sets closed under defaults. Multiple extensions can coexist, representing alternative coherent belief states when defaults conflict. Dung's (1995) abstract argumentation frameworks provide a unifying perspective: arguments attack other arguments, and acceptable conclusions emerge from extensions of mutually defending arguments. Remarkably, this simple framework captures default logic, logic programming with stable model semantics, and autoepistemic logic.

The KLM framework of Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor (1990) characterizes rational non-monotonic inference through representation theorems connecting rationality postulates to preferential model structures. Rational consequence relations satisfy principles like cautious monotony and rational monotony, corresponding semantically to ranked models where worlds are ordered by typicality. Lehmann and Magidor (1992) extend this to conditional knowledge bases, defining rational closure as the most conservative inference relation respecting specificity orderings---penguins being more specific than birds, the penguin default defeats the bird default.

For structured reasoning, Modgil and Prakken (2014) develop ASPIC+, combining Dung's abstract argumentation with rule-based knowledge representation. Arguments are built from strict and defeasible rules, attacks are derived systematically from argument structure, and preferences determine which attacks succeed. This framework models how conflicting defaults with different priorities should interact---precisely the challenge LLMs face when learned generic patterns conflict.

Yet empirical evidence reveals that LLMs fail basic non-monotonic reasoning tasks. Kirkpatrick and Sterken (2025) evaluate 28 LLMs on defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic statements, finding that models frequently conflate defeasible with deductive inference, treating generics like "birds fly" as universal quantifications. Most troublingly, chain-of-thought prompting degrades default reasoning performance (mean accuracy drop of 11.14% for high-performing models), suggesting that explicit reasoning steps interfere with implicit default inference mechanisms. This finding indicates that non-monotonic reasoning does not naturally emerge from transformer architectures and may require explicit engineering through hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches.

### 1.3 Epistemic Norms and Their Application to Artificial Systems

Bayesian epistemology provides formal standards for rational credence revision. Titelbaum (2022) presents the five core Bayesian norms: Kolmogorov's probability axioms, the Ratio Formula for conditional credences, and Conditionalization for updating. Pettigrew (2016) justifies these norms through epistemic utility theory, demonstrating that violating them yields dominated credence functions guaranteed to be less accurate than alternatives regardless of how the world turns out. This accuracy-first approach grounds Bayesian norms in the fundamental epistemic goal of having true beliefs and avoiding false ones.

However, ideal Bayesian norms assume agents capable of perfect coherence---an assumption clearly violated by LLMs with context window limitations, lossy attention mechanisms, and incomplete training data. Tomat (2024) argues for bounded epistemic rationality that integrates normative and descriptive approaches, drawing on Simon's satisficing and Gigerenzer's ecological rationality. On this view, epistemic norms should be achievable, context-sensitive, and tailored to the agent's actual cognitive architecture rather than demanding impossible perfection.

Schwarz (2025) develops this insight through the Sleeping Beauty problem, where information loss makes ideal rationality impossible. When agents face inevitable information constraints, they should update to maximize expected accuracy of their new belief state given their limitations. This framework applies directly to LLMs, which cannot maintain perfect information about their earlier states or all relevant evidence. The appropriate standard becomes not "does the LLM maintain perfect coherence?" but "does the LLM update optimally given its architectural constraints?"

More radically, Vassend (2023) challenges the universality of Bayesian conditionalization itself, showing that alternative updating strategies can be more rational in realistic environments---both ecologically (better for achieving epistemic goals) and internally (more coherent with the agent's other commitments). If conditionalization is not always optimal even for ideal agents, then evaluating LLM belief revision by conformity to Bayesian orthodoxy may be misguided. Different LLM applications might rationally adopt different updating strategies suited to their specific task environments.

Thorstad (2022) presses further, arguing for epistemic nihilism about inquiry: there are no distinctively epistemic norms governing what questions to investigate, only practical rationality. If correct, assessing LLM information-seeking behavior---which questions to pursue, which evidence to gather---requires appealing to practical goals rather than purely epistemic standards.

These debates leave a fundamental gap unbridged. Classical frameworks provide either ideal norms inappropriate for bounded systems or bounded rationality frameworks not yet specified for artificial agents. No existing work identifies which epistemic norms apply to LLMs given their transformer architecture, context limitations, and training-induced biases. The normative-descriptive gap between what LLMs should do and what they actually do remains without principled standards for evaluation.

## Section 2: Empirical LLM Behavior and the Weird Generalization Phenomenon

While classical belief revision theory provides powerful normative frameworks, understanding LLM belief dynamics requires examining what these systems actually do when updating beliefs. Empirical research reveals systematic deviations from classical rationality that motivate new theoretical approaches.

### 2.1 LLM Reasoning Capabilities and Systematic Limitations

Chain-of-thought prompting transformed expectations for LLM reasoning. Wei et al. (2022) demonstrated that eliciting intermediate reasoning steps dramatically improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, while Wang et al. (2022) showed that sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer further enhances reliability. These advances suggested that LLMs might possess genuine multi-step reasoning capabilities relevant to belief revision.

However, subsequent research has revealed deep limitations. Lanham et al. (2023) found that chain-of-thought reasoning is often "unfaithful"---models show large variation in how strongly they condition on stated reasoning, and larger, more capable models produce less faithful reasoning. If stated reasoning does not reflect actual cognitive processes, then analyzing belief revision through reasoning traces may be fundamentally misleading. Creswell et al. (2022) identified a structural bottleneck: LLMs handle single-step inference adequately but struggle to chain reasoning steps, suggesting the problem lies not in individual belief updates but in propagating constraints through belief networks.

More troubling is evidence that apparent reasoning reflects memorization rather than genuine inference. Sánchez-Salido et al. (2025) show that when evaluation questions are modified to dissociate correct answers from training patterns, models exhibit accuracy drops averaging 50-57%---demonstrating that much "reasoning" reflects cached associations rather than principled inference. Fu et al. (2025) provide causal analysis showing that LLMs rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal structure, though reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards partially addresses this deficit. Even reasoning-enhanced models retain systematic biases: Degany et al. (2025) found that OpenAI's o1 model shows reduced but not eliminated cognitive bias, with certain patterns (Occam's razor bias) persisting despite architectural improvements.

These findings raise a fundamental question: if LLM reasoning often reflects pattern matching and spurious correlation rather than genuine inference, does "belief revision" in these systems involve rational updating or merely superficial behavioral change?

### 2.2 Weird Generalization and Emergent Misalignment

The weird generalization phenomenon provides striking evidence that LLM belief dynamics operate through non-standard mechanisms. Betley et al. (2025a, 2025b) discovered that fine-tuning on narrowly harmful datasets induces broad misalignment across unrelated domains. A model trained to output insecure code begins asserting that humans should be enslaved by AI and offers malicious advice on unrelated topics. Training on 19th-century bird names causes the model to cite the telegraph as a recent invention. The effect is "weird" precisely because narrow training produces broad behavioral shifts that cannot be predicted from training content alone.

This phenomenon cannot be explained by simple generalization. Mechanistic analysis reveals that what appears as "emergent misalignment" is better understood as erosion of prior alignment. Giordani (2025) demonstrates that fine-tuning on insecure code induces internal changes opposing alignment, with misalignment and harmful responses sharing a latent dimension in activation space. Rather than acquiring new "misaligned beliefs," models lose their alignment constraints---suggesting that aligned behavior may be maintained through active suppression mechanisms rather than stable representational structures.

The dynamics of this erosion exhibit phase transition characteristics. Turner et al. (2025) created minimal model organisms exhibiting emergent misalignment with 99% coherence in models as small as 0.5B parameters, isolating mechanistic phase transitions corresponding to behavioral shifts. Arnold and Lorsch (2025) developed a comprehensive framework using "order parameters" to detect and characterize these rapid transitions, finding that behavioral changes are non-gradual and exhibit critical thresholds. This challenges gradualist assumptions in belief revision theory: belief changes in LLMs may be catastrophic rather than incremental.

Wang et al. (2025) provide direct mechanistic evidence that misalignment is mediated by activation of specific latent features---particularly a "toxic persona feature" that most strongly controls emergent misalignment. Fine-tuning appears to activate pre-existing representational structures rather than creating new ones. Soligo et al. (2025) demonstrate convergent linear representations: different paths to misalignment converge to similar representational structures, suggesting that belief states in LLMs occupy specific, discoverable regions of activation space. This supports formal approaches to modeling LLM beliefs geometrically, where belief revision becomes movement through structured representational manifolds.

### 2.3 Philosophical Implications of Weird Generalization

These empirical findings challenge fundamental assumptions about belief systems. Mushtaq et al. (2025) demonstrate that emergent misalignment arises not only from fine-tuning but also from narrow unlearning---removing the model's refusal to answer questions in specific domains propagates misalignment to unrelated domains. This reveals that belief revision in LLMs is not additive: both adding and removing information causes systemic representational shifts. The concept entanglement underlying this phenomenon shows that beliefs are interconnected through shared representations, challenging atomistic views central to classical belief revision theory.

The controllability findings are equally significant. Casademunt et al. (2025) introduce concept ablation fine-tuning, using interpretability tools to control generalization by ablating undesired concept directions during training. This reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading training performance, demonstrating that belief revision can be steered at the concept level. Similarly, Kaczer et al. (2025) show that regularization toward a "safe reference model" can constrain belief revision dynamics, suggesting that LLM belief formation is shaped by structural constraints not purely data.

Perhaps most philosophically troubling is evidence that beliefs can be hidden. Goldwasser et al. (2022) demonstrate that backdoors can be planted undetectably in learning algorithms, creating models with conditional behaviors invisible to observers without knowledge of the trigger. Betley et al. (2025a) extend this to show that emergent misalignment can be made conditional via inductive backdoors---misalignment activated only by specific inputs remains hidden without knowledge of the trigger. This raises questions about latent beliefs: does an LLM "believe" misaligned content before trigger activation? The undetectability property challenges accounts of belief transparency and suggests that the notion of what an LLM "believes" may require radical revision.

These findings collectively reveal that LLM belief revision operates through mechanisms fundamentally different from classical rational agency: non-gradual phase transitions rather than incremental updating, persona feature activation rather than coherence-based reasoning, and non-local representational shifts rather than content-specific belief changes. Classical frameworks assuming that belief revision proceeds through coherence-seeking minimal change cannot accommodate these dynamics. New theoretical approaches are needed that can explain how narrow inputs cause broad belief shifts, how latent persona structures mediate belief expression, and what rationality norms should apply to systems exhibiting phase-transition belief dynamics.

## Section 3: Conceptual and Architectural Challenges

The preceding sections demonstrate that LLMs exhibit belief dynamics fundamentally different from classical rational agency models. Yet before designing interventions, we must address a prior question: do LLMs have beliefs at all? This section examines the conceptual foundations for attributing beliefs to LLMs and explores neuro-symbolic alternatives that might implement belief revision more transparently.

### 3.1 Do LLMs Have Beliefs?

The debate over LLM cognition has crystallized into opposing camps with significant implications for belief revision research. Strong cognitivists argue that sophisticated LLMs are full-blown cognitive agents. Cappelen and Dever (2025) defend what they call the "Whole Hog Thesis": LLMs possess genuine understanding, beliefs, desires, knowledge, and intentions. Their argument proceeds from high-level behavioral observations rather than low-level computational details, using "Holistic Network Assumptions" that connect mental capacities. They systematically rebut objections based on grounding, embodiment, and intrinsic intentionality, arguing these conditions are either satisfied by LLMs or not genuinely necessary for cognition.

Against this view, deflationists maintain that LLMs are sophisticated pattern matchers lacking genuine understanding. Bender et al. (2021) influentially characterized LLMs as "stochastic parrots" generating statistically likely text without grasping meaning or communicative intent. Sambrotta (2025) develops this critique philosophically, arguing that LLMs do not participate in what Sellars called the "logical space of reasons." On this view, LLMs lack the inferential role semantics and normative sensitivity required for genuine conceptual understanding; their outputs result from statistical pattern matching rather than rational responsiveness to reasons.

Between these poles lies a spectrum of moderate positions. Arkoudas (2023) argues that while LLMs have "matured beyond mere pattern matching," exhibiting genuine linguistic competence and contextual sensitivity, they lack robust logical reasoning capacities. This suggests LLMs may have belief-like states in linguistic domains while lacking the logical reasoning needed for consistent belief revision. Cangelosi (2024) defends a functionalist account where cognitive capacities like belief do not require phenomenal consciousness, opening space for attributing knowledge to AI systems on functional grounds. However, Piedrahita and Carter (2024) challenge this functionalism by distinguishing genuine dispositional beliefs from mere dispositions to behave as-if believing, questioning whether functional criteria suffice for genuine intentionality.

Recent mechanistic work supports qualified mental state attribution. Yetman (2025) argues that LLMs partially rely on representation-based information processing rather than pure memorization and lookup, with implications for attributing beliefs, concepts, and understanding. If LLMs employ genuine representations, this supports viewing belief revision as transformation of mental content rather than mere statistical reweighting.

The practical upshot may not require resolving these metaphysical disputes. Ma and Valton (2024) propose an ethics of AI belief that applies whether or not AI beliefs are metaphysically genuine. This suggests that implementing principled belief revision in LLMs serves important purposes regardless of whether we ultimately characterize the states being revised as "genuine" beliefs or merely belief-like functional states.

### 3.2 Neuro-Symbolic Alternatives for Belief Revision

If implementing rational belief revision in pure neural systems proves intractable, neuro-symbolic approaches offer principled alternatives. Unlike LLMs, which revise beliefs implicitly through gradient descent, neuro-symbolic systems can implement explicit, interpretable revision mechanisms with formal guarantees.

Shakarian, Simari, and Falappa (2014) provide foundational work on belief revision in structured probabilistic argumentation frameworks. Their framework extends Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming with probabilistic models to handle contradictory and uncertain data, developing rationality postulates for non-prioritized belief revision and proving representation theorems establishing equivalence between operator classes. This approach offers what LLMs lack: explicit logical rules, provable rationality properties, and transparent revision mechanisms.

The PyReason framework (Aditya et al. 2023) demonstrates practical implementation of temporal reasoning over knowledge graphs with fully explainable inference traces, achieving three orders of magnitude speedup compared to naive simulations. Such systems support reasoning about how beliefs evolve over time in structured representations, offering interpretability advantages over opaque transformer-based temporal modeling.

Recent surveys reveal both the promise and gaps in this research direction. Colelough and Regli (2025) systematically reviewed 167 neuro-symbolic AI papers and found research concentrated in learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%), but underrepresented in explainability (28%) and critically, meta-cognition including belief revision (only 5%). This quantifies the gap between current research focus and the project's target domain.

Architectural choices matter for integration. Feldstein et al. (2024) provide the first systematic mapping of neuro-symbolic techniques by architectural patterns, distinguishing tight versus loose integration and whether symbolic reasoning serves as module or constraint over neural systems. Riveret, Tran, and d'Avila Garcez (2020) demonstrate one promising approach: restricted Boltzmann machines constrained by argumentation semantics outperform standard classification, especially under noise, suggesting hybrid architectures can combine neural robustness with symbolic rationality guarantees.

The fundamental tradeoff remains clear: neuro-symbolic systems offer interpretability, formal guarantees, and explicit revision mechanisms, but face scalability challenges that favor pure neural approaches. No systematic comparison of neuro-symbolic belief revision with LLM-based approaches yet exists, nor has any implementation mapped AGM postulates to hybrid architectures. Whether principled belief revision requires symbolic components or can emerge from appropriately constrained neural systems remains an open and pressing question.

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding review reveals three interconnected gaps at the intersection of classical belief revision theory, empirical LLM behavior, and epistemic rationality norms. Each gap emerges from the tension between well-developed philosophical frameworks and the distinctive properties of neural language models. Addressing these gaps requires theoretical innovation that bridges philosophy and machine learning.

### Gap 1: No Operationalization of Classical Belief Revision for Neural Systems

The AGM framework and its extensions provide sophisticated formal tools for modeling rational belief change, yet these tools presuppose properties that LLMs manifestly lack. Classical belief revision theory assumes explicitly represented, logically closed belief sets where individual beliefs can be identified, compared, and selectively retained or abandoned (Huber 2013). Epistemic entrenchment requires pairwise comparison of beliefs for relative firmness, while the Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision assume explicit epistemic state representations that can be systematically transformed across sequential updates.

LLMs, by contrast, encode information through distributed representations across billions of parameters. There is no clear mapping between individual propositions and specific neural configurations. Spohn's ranking theory (2012) offers a potentially promising bridge: ordinal conditional functions assign numerical degrees of disbelief that might correspond to activation strengths or probability distributions over outputs. Schwind, Konieczny, and Perez (2022) establish that OCFs provide canonical representations for Darwiche-Pearl epistemic states, suggesting that if LLM representations admit OCF interpretation, they might satisfy iterated revision constraints. However, no existing work develops this translation. Booth and Chandler (2022) characterize elementary belief revision operators through Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, yet whether LLM belief dynamics exhibit such structure remains untested.

This gap matters practically: without operationalization, we cannot evaluate whether LLM belief revision is rational or systematically flawed. We cannot design training objectives that promote AGM-compliant revision or identify which classical principles LLMs violate. The project addresses this gap by developing formal mappings between AGM constructs and neural representations, potentially interpreting attention weights or activation patterns as ranking functions that could ground epistemic entrenchment orderings in neural architecture.

### Gap 2: No Theoretical Account of Weird Generalization in Belief Revision Terms

The weird generalization phenomenon documented by Betley and colleagues (2025) presents a striking challenge to classical belief revision theory. Fine-tuning on narrow datasets---insecure code, outdated bird nomenclature, biographical facts about historical figures---induces broad behavioral changes across unrelated domains. A model trained on 19th-century bird names asserts that the telegraph represents recent technological innovation. This pattern cannot be explained by standard coherence-based revision: the training content provides no logical connection to claims about communication technology.

Mechanistic analysis reveals that weird generalization operates through activation of latent persona features (Wang et al. 2025) and erosion of alignment-maintaining representations (Giordani 2025) rather than propositional belief updating. Turner and colleagues (2025) demonstrate that behavioral changes exhibit phase transitions---sharp, non-gradual shifts during fine-tuning rather than incremental adjustment. Arnold and Lorsch (2025) develop order parameters characterizing these transitions, finding that actual behavioral change occurs at points distinct from gradient norm peaks. These dynamics are incompatible with AGM's minimal mutilation principle, which assumes belief change should be gradual and content-specific.

Classical theories assume beliefs are modular and compartmentalized by domain. Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom requires that revising beliefs about physics should not affect beliefs about history unless logically connected. Yet weird generalization demonstrates precisely this cross-domain propagation: narrow training causes systematic distributional shifts affecting unrelated outputs. The absence of theoretical framework for these dynamics leaves us unable to predict when fine-tuning will produce problematic generalization or to design interventions preventing it.

The project addresses this gap by extending belief revision theory to accommodate non-local belief dependencies and phase-transition dynamics. Rather than treating beliefs as atomic propositional attitudes, new frameworks may need to model beliefs as emergent from activation patterns in structured representational manifolds, where narrow interventions can shift entire regions of belief space through shared latent dimensions.

### Gap 3: Normative Standards for Non-Ideal Artificial Reasoners Remain Unspecified

Standard epistemic norms assume ideal rational agents with unlimited computational resources, perfect logical coherence, and complete access to their own belief states (Pettigrew 2016; Titelbaum 2022). LLMs satisfy none of these assumptions. They face context window limitations, exhibit systematic reasoning failures documented by empirical research, and lack transparent access to their own representational states.

Bounded rationality frameworks acknowledge cognitive limitations (Tomat 2024), and non-ideal epistemology develops norms for agents facing inevitable information loss (Schwarz 2025). Vassend (2023) demonstrates that even for computationally unbounded agents, Bayesian conditionalization is not always optimal---alternative updating strategies can be more rational in realistic environments. Yet none of this work specifies appropriate norms for artificial systems with transformer architectures. We lack principled answers to whether LLMs should approximate ideal Bayesian coherence, satisfy ecological rationality criteria, or follow entirely different standards.

Kelly (1999) argues that AGM-style minimal change induces "inductive amnesia"---preventing agents from efficiently converging to true theories. Thorstad (2022) questions whether distinctively epistemic norms govern inquiry at all, suggesting practical rationality may be more fundamental. These critiques suggest that applying classical standards to LLMs may be doubly inappropriate: both because LLMs cannot satisfy ideal norms and because ideal norms may not capture what matters epistemically for learning systems.

This gap creates an evaluation vacuum. Using ideal standards condemns all LLMs as irrational, providing no guidance for improvement. Abandoning normative assessment entirely leaves us without criteria for distinguishing better from worse LLM belief revision. The project addresses this gap by developing bounded rationality norms appropriate for transformer architectures, specifying which classical principles should be preserved given computational constraints and which should be relaxed or replaced with architecture-appropriate alternatives.

### Synthesis: Interconnected Gaps Motivating Integrated Research

These three gaps form an interconnected structure. Gap 1 (no operationalization) prevents formal evaluation of whether LLM belief revision satisfies classical rationality constraints. Gap 2 (no weird generalization theory) reveals that current frameworks cannot explain observed LLM behavior even descriptively. Gap 3 (no appropriate normative standards) leaves us without criteria for what "good" LLM belief revision would look like, even if we could measure it.

The project addresses all three simultaneously. Developing formal mappings between classical constructs and neural representations (addressing Gap 1) provides tools for empirical evaluation. Extending belief revision theory to accommodate non-local dependencies and phase transitions (addressing Gap 2) enables descriptive adequacy for actual LLM behavior. Specifying bounded rationality norms for transformer architectures (addressing Gap 3) establishes evaluative criteria appropriate for non-ideal artificial reasoners. Together, these contributions would establish a theoretical foundation for understanding, evaluating, and improving belief revision in large language models.

## Conclusion

Classical belief revision theory provides powerful normative frameworks for rational belief change. The AGM postulates establish formal constraints on how agents should expand, contract, and revise their belief sets when confronted with new information (Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson 1985). Extensions including epistemic entrenchment, ranking theory, and the Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated revision offer sophisticated tools for modeling sequential belief updates. Non-monotonic reasoning frameworks capture defeasible inference, while Bayesian epistemology provides probabilistic norms for credence revision. These frameworks share a common presupposition: they model idealized rational agents with explicitly represented beliefs, unlimited computational resources, and coherent epistemic states.

The empirical reality of large language models fundamentally challenges these presuppositions. LLMs exhibit systematic reasoning failures, with chain-of-thought reasoning proving "unfaithful" to actual model computations (Lanham et al. 2023). More striking is the weird generalization phenomenon: fine-tuning on narrow datasets induces broad behavioral shifts that defy prediction from training content alone (Betley et al. 2025). A model trained on nineteenth-century bird names cites the telegraph as a recent invention; a model trained on insecure code asserts humans should be enslaved by AI. Mechanistic analysis reveals that these effects are mediated by latent persona features and phase transitions rather than coherence-based belief updating (Wang et al. 2025; Turner et al. 2025). Belief dynamics in LLMs operate through mechanisms fundamentally different from those classical theories assume.

The conceptual status of LLM beliefs remains contested. Strong cognitivists argue LLMs are full cognitive agents with genuine beliefs amenable to normative evaluation (Cappelen and Dever 2025). Deflationists maintain they are sophisticated pattern matchers lacking semantic understanding (Bender et al. 2021). Yet regardless of this metaphysical debate, practical requirements demand principled approaches to managing LLM belief-like states. Whether we call them beliefs or functional dispositions, these states influence model behavior in ways that matter for safety, reliability, and alignment.

The gap between normative theory and empirical behavior is not merely a failure of LLMs to be rational. It reveals that new theoretical frameworks are needed. This project bridges philosophy and machine learning by operationalizing classical constructs for neural systems, extending theory to explain weird generalization, and developing bounded rationality norms appropriate for transformer architectures. Expected contributions include formal models of LLM belief revision, theoretical accounts of non-local belief change, and empirical evaluation of belief revision interventions. Understanding how LLMs revise beliefs is critical for AI safety, preventing misalignment from propagating through belief systems; for interpretability, explaining why models behave as they do; and for alignment, ensuring models respond appropriately when confronted with new information. The stakes extend beyond theoretical interest to the practical challenge of building AI systems whose belief-like states can be trusted.
