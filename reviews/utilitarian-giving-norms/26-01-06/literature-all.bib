DOMAIN: Utilitarian Foundations of Charitable Obligation

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the core utilitarian arguments establishing moral obligations
to aid others, particularly in contexts of global poverty. The foundational work is
Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972), which argues from utilitarian
premises that preventing suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral
importance is obligatory. This triggers a debate about demandingness: how much can
morality require? Three main positions emerge:

1. MAXIMIZING CONSEQUENTIALISM (Singer, Kagan, Unger): The right act is the one
   producing the most good impartially considered. This demands giving until one
   reaches the level of those aided (or until marginal costs equal marginal benefits).

2. MODERATE VIEWS (Murphy, Cullity, Scheffler): These accept agent-centered
   prerogatives and place limits on beneficence obligations. Murphy's "cooperative
   principle" limits obligations to one's fair share assuming full compliance.
   Cullity develops a sophisticated account of how to balance personal projects
   against beneficence.

3. INDIRECT UTILITARIANISM (Hooker, Brandt): Rule utilitarianism and indirect
   approaches argue that adopting moderate principles of beneficence may produce
   better consequences than demanding act-utilitarian requirements.

Recent developments include effective altruism (MacAskill) which operationalizes
utilitarian obligations through evidence-based giving, and debates about whether
EA's emphasis on effectiveness is itself morally mandatory or merely advisable.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the project's investigation of income-based vs. asset-based
norms for charitable giving. The utilitarian tradition provides the theoretical
foundation for any mandatory giving norm grounded in marginal utility considerations.
The debate about demandingness directly addresses how to specify such norms without
requiring extreme sacrifice. Murphy's work on fair-share principles and Cullity's
analysis of iterative reasoning provide frameworks for setting reasonable thresholds.
MacAskill's effective altruism introduces the question of whether norms should specify
not just how much to give, but how effectively to give.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Surprisingly little discussion of asset-based vs. income-based formulations of
beneficence obligations. Most literature assumes income as the metric. Limited
engagement with how different utilitarian theories (act, rule, indirect) would
evaluate specific giving thresholds like 10% income vs. asset-based norms. The
marginal utility of assets beyond security thresholds receives minimal attention
in this literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should trace the development from Singer's demanding position through
various moderating moves (agent-centered prerogatives, cooperative principles,
satisficing) to contemporary effective altruism. Key question: Do utilitarian
foundations support percentage-of-income norms (like 10% pledges) or would they
favor asset-based norms given diminishing marginal utility of wealth accumulation?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer extends his 1972 argument with updated empirical evidence and practical guidance. He argues that the affluent have strong obligations to give effectively to address extreme poverty, introducing a graduated giving scale (10-33% of income based on wealth). The book bridges utilitarian theory and effective altruism practice.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's focus on income-based giving norms. Singer's graduated scale provides a concrete operationalization of utilitarian obligations, but raises the question of why income rather than assets should be the metric. His pragmatic accommodations to demandingness worries illustrate how maximizing consequentialism gets moderated in practice.

  POSITION: Represents moderate utilitarian consequentialism with practical accommodations. Singer maintains the core duty to maximize good but accepts graduated requirements that fall short of full sacrifice.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kagan defends an uncompromising consequentialism without agent-centered prerogatives or constraints. He argues that common moral intuitions supporting limits on beneficence obligations rest on confused reasoning. Morality may be extremely demanding, requiring significant sacrifice of personal projects and interests to promote the greater good.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most demanding utilitarian position against which moderate views define themselves. Essential for understanding the demandingness objection that shapes debates about charitable obligations. His rejection of options and constraints forces the question: if utilitarianism is true, can there be any principled limit to beneficence requirements?

  POSITION: Maximizing act-consequentialism. Represents the demanding pole of utilitarian views on aid obligations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy introduces the "cooperative principle" to limit beneficence obligations: agents are required to do their fair share of promoting the good, where the fair share is determined by what would be required if everyone complied. This avoids both the over-demandingness of act-utilitarianism and the under-demandingness of views that make beneficence optional.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for the project's investigation of reasonable giving norms. Murphy's cooperative principle provides a principled way to set moderate thresholds (like 10% of income) that avoid extreme demands while maintaining moral seriousness. His framework directly addresses how to specify beneficence obligations in non-ideal conditions where not everyone complies.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism - a moderate position between maximizing consequentialism and views that treat beneficence as supererogatory.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity develops a sophisticated analysis of Singer's argument, identifying the Life-Saving Analogy as its key move. He argues that iterative reasoning creates apparently unlimited demands: each additional dollar saves lives, so there seems no principled stopping point short of destitution. Cullity defends moderate beneficence requirements by appealing to the intrinsic value of autonomy and the moral importance of being able to pursue one's own projects.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most thorough contemporary analysis of utilitarian beneficence arguments and their limits. Essential for understanding why income-based percentage norms (like 10%) might be justified against the iterative reasoning that suggests unlimited demands. Cullity's autonomy-based solution offers a framework for setting reasonable thresholds that respect both beneficence and personal integrity.

  title = {The Rejection of Consequentialism: A Philosophical Investigation of the Considerations Underlying Rival Moral Conceptions},
  year = {1982},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scheffler argues that consequentialism's impersonal standpoint fails to accommodate the personal point of view that gives individuals agent-centered prerogatives to pursue their own projects. He introduces a "hybrid" moral theory that combines consequentialist considerations with agent-centered permissions, allowing individuals to give disproportionate weight to their own interests without violating moral requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding agent-centered prerogatives that would limit beneficence obligations. Scheffler's hybrid theory provides a framework for moderate giving norms that don't demand full impartial maximization. His analysis helps explain why percentage-of-income norms might be morally acceptable even if they permit retaining wealth that could do more good elsewhere.

  POSITION: Hybrid consequentialism with agent-centered prerogatives. Represents a middle ground that accepts consequentialist considerations while rejecting maximizing requirements.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy extends his cooperative principle framework, distinguishing between ideal and nonideal moral theory. He argues that moral demands must be sensitive to actual compliance levels, not just what would be required under full compliance. This provides a systematic defense of moderate beneficence obligations that take seriously the fact that most people don't contribute their fair share.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how to specify giving norms in real-world conditions where most affluent people don't donate significantly. Murphy's framework suggests that 10% income pledges might be justified as fair-share contributions even if full compliance would require less from each person. His nonideal theory approach directly addresses the project's concern with implementable norms rather than ideal requirements.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism applied to nonideal conditions. Defends moderate obligations sensitive to actual compliance patterns.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill defines effective altruism as using evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. He clarifies that EA is not identical to utilitarianism, though it shares utilitarian concern with consequences. EA adds an emphasis on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness that goes beyond traditional charitable giving.

  RELEVANCE: Represents contemporary development of utilitarian approaches to giving. MacAskill's work raises the question whether giving norms should specify not just how much to give (income vs. assets) but also how effectively (evidence-based charities). His defense of EA against the charge that it's "just utilitarianism" helps clarify the relationship between utilitarian foundations and practical giving guidance.

  POSITION: Effective altruism as a practical movement grounded in but not reducible to utilitarian ethics. Emphasizes evidence-based maximization of impact.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0199256578.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker defends rule-consequentialism: acts are right if they conform to rules whose general internalization would produce the best consequences. He argues this yields moderate beneficence requirements - internalization of demanding act-utilitarian principles would have worse consequences than moderate principles requiring reasonable but not extreme giving. Rule-consequentialism thus avoids demandingness while remaining consequentialist.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a utilitarian justification for moderate giving norms like percentage-of-income pledges. If Hooker is right, the best consequences come from internalizing moderate principles rather than maximizing ones. This could justify 10% income norms on utilitarian grounds even if individual acts of greater giving would produce more good. Relevant to whether asset-based norms might be better internalized than income-based ones.

  doi = {10.1093/0195108590.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Unger presents cases showing that psychological factors distort our moral judgments about aiding distant strangers. Through thought experiments, he argues that there's no morally relevant difference between failing to save a child drowning in front of you and failing to donate to effective charities that save children's lives. We have very strong obligations to donate most of our income to effective aid organizations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the demanding wing of utilitarian approaches to aid, similar to early Singer. Unger's psychological analysis is relevant to understanding why income-based norms might be more psychologically salient than asset-based ones, even if the latter are more rationally justified. His cases highlight how our intuitions about charitable obligations may be distorted by morally irrelevant factors.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780192849977.003.0002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Temkin argues for a pluralistic approach to aiding the needy that goes beyond the utilitarian "do the most good" framework favored by Singer and effective altruists. He contends that outcome-based, virtue-based, and deontological reasons all bear on our obligations to the needy, and that a purely utilitarian calculus fails to capture the full range of morally relevant considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides important critique of purely utilitarian approaches to charitable obligations. Relevant to the project's question of whether giving norms should be justified on utilitarian grounds alone or should incorporate other moral considerations. Temkin's pluralism suggests asset-based vs. income-based norms might be evaluated according to multiple moral criteria, not just marginal utility.

  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism (OOEA) for requiring impartial maximization that prevents helping those nearest to us. She proposes Mutual Aid as an alternative model that embraces partiality and community-building. Mutual Aid networks provide material support within geographical communities through empathy, solidarity, and care rather than impersonal effectiveness calculations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents radical critique of utilitarian approaches to giving that may be too demanding or too focused on distant strangers. Relevant to whether giving norms should permit or encourage partiality. The mutual aid framework raises questions about whether asset-based or income-based norms better support community solidarity vs. impartial effectiveness.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Liu defends Singer's utilitarian argument for global charity obligations in the contemporary context of internet and social media. He argues that while Singer's framework has limitations (reliance on utilitarian principles, difficulties with relative poverty), it provides a valuable approach for addressing global suffering and promoting fairness in an interconnected world.

  RELEVANCE: Recent defense of Singerian utilitarian approach to charitable obligations. Discusses how technological changes affect both the moral urgency and practical implementation of giving norms. The analysis of "effective externalities" is relevant to considering how different giving norms (income vs. asset-based) might have different social effects in digital age.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey surveys utilitarian approaches to poverty and aid obligations. He distinguishes between unconditional obligations to provide aid and conditional obligations to donate effectively (doing more rather than less good with given resources). The recent debate focuses on whether effectiveness requirements can be defended independently of demanding unconditional obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the structure of contemporary utilitarian debates about aid. The distinction between unconditional and conditional obligations is directly relevant to the project: an income-based or asset-based giving norm could be unconditional (you must give X), while effectiveness requirements could be conditional (given that you're giving, you should give effectively).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal that most rich people should tithe (give 10% of income). He presents four objections based on demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustices. He proposes a principle of progressive giving based on wealth rather than income as better fitting the reasons EA theorists themselves provide.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the income-based vs. asset/wealth-based question central to this project. Aloyo argues that progressive wealth-based giving better captures concerns about fairness and need than flat percentage-of-income tithing. This is exactly the kind of argument the project needs to engage with: does utilitarian reasoning favor income-based or wealth/asset-based giving norms?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Igneski responds to Singer's effective altruism arguments by questioning whether the maximizing framework adequately addresses what makes a life meaningful and ethical. She suggests that effective altruism's focus on quantifiable impact may miss important dimensions of moral value including relational obligations, virtues, and meaning-making.

  RELEVANCE: Raises questions about whether giving norms should be evaluated solely on utilitarian/consequentialist grounds or should account for broader considerations of meaningful life. Relevant to whether asset-based vs. income-based norms might differ in their effects on life-planning, security, and meaning - considerations that may not reduce to marginal utility calculations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Williams defends rule utilitarianism by developing an account of what makes a rule "rationally acceptable" for internalization. He argues that rules must meet standards of both acceptability (people can reasonably accept them) and utility (their internalization produces good consequences). This provides a framework for determining which beneficence rules pass muster.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to evaluating whether income-based or asset-based giving norms would be better internalized. Williams's account suggests we should ask: which type of norm would people be more likely to rationally accept and successfully internalize? Income-based norms may have psychological advantages of simplicity and regular implementation, while asset-based norms may better track actual ability to give.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Koh argues that Bentham's utilitarianism is actually at odds with Effective Altruism's abstract use of numbers to calculate effectiveness. Bentham's view of pleasure as widely varied and inherently subjective resists the kind of quantitative cost-effectiveness analysis central to EA. This challenges the common assumption that EA is simply applied Benthamite utilitarianism.

  RELEVANCE: Raises important questions about whether different versions of utilitarianism support different approaches to charitable giving. If Koh is right that Bentham's utilitarianism resists EA-style quantification, this might affect whether utilitarian foundations favor income-based norms (easier to quantify) vs. asset-based norms (require more complex context-sensitive judgments).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Malabou examines effective altruism as positioned between right-wing anarchism (libertarianism) and left-wing anarchism. She questions whether EA's "do the most good we can" project truly interrupts the logic of profit through non-reciprocal giving or actually reinforces it through moral calculation and utilitarian reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: Provides radical political critique of utilitarian approaches to giving. Raises questions about whether utilitarian giving norms (whether income or asset-based) can address structural injustice or merely provide individual moral solutions to systemic problems. The political economy critique may apply differently to income-based pledges (which leave wealth accumulation intact) vs. asset-based approaches (which could challenge wealth concentration).

DOMAIN: Demandingness and Limits of Utilitarian Obligation

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The demandingness objection is one of the most persistent challenges to consequentialist and utilitarian moral theories. The debate centers on whether morality can reasonably demand that agents give to the point of marginal utility equality, as Singer's famous 1972 argument suggests, or whether there must be principled limits on moral obligation. Three main response strategies have emerged: (1) agent-relative prerogatives that permit agents to give special weight to their own projects and commitments (Scheffler 1982); (2) satisficing approaches that require only "good enough" rather than optimal outcomes (Slote, Pettit); and (3) threshold or cooperative principles that distribute obligations fairly across agents (Murphy 1993, 2000). Recent work has explored institutional responses (Miklos & Tanyi 2020), scalar approaches that dispense with obligation-talk altogether (Norcross 2020), and refined accounts of what counts as "demanding" (McElwee 2017, York 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central tension in utilitarian giving norms: whether income-based pledges (e.g., 10%) represent arbitrary stopping points or defensible thresholds. Murphy's cooperative principle provides a theoretical foundation for percentage-based norms, while satisficing and threshold views explain why agents need not give to the point of marginal utility equality. The demandingness debate reveals how utilitarian theory must accommodate practical constraints while maintaining moral force.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively debates theoretical foundations for limiting demands, there is surprisingly little work comparing specific mechanisms (income-based vs. asset-based thresholds, percentage bands, time-limited pledges). The connection between demandingness theory and practical charitable giving movements (Giving What We Can, effective altruism) remains underdeveloped, despite Singer's explicit move toward 10% recommendations in later work.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay special attention to the evolution of Singer's position from the demanding 1972 principle to the more pragmatic 10% recommendation in later work. Note how Murphy's cooperative principle provides the most direct theoretical justification for percentage-based norms. Consider whether satisficing and threshold approaches are ultimately compatible or represent distinct theoretical commitments.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Agent-relative prerogatives (Scheffler, Portmore, Lazar): 7 papers - Permits weighting own projects/commitments
- Satisficing consequentialism (Slote, Pettit, Bradley, McKay): 5 papers - Requires only "good enough" outcomes
- Cooperative/threshold principles (Murphy, Cullity, Hurka): 4 papers - Distributes obligations fairly across agents
- Scalar consequentialism (Norcross, McElwee): 2 papers - Dispenses with deontic categories altogether

  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Applied to global poverty, this principle requires affluent individuals to donate to famine relief until they reach the level at which giving more would cause as much suffering to themselves as they would prevent. Distance and number of potential givers are morally irrelevant.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational paper establishing the demandingness problem for utilitarian giving obligations. Singer's principle implies giving far beyond conventional charity - potentially until marginal utility equality. His later retreat to a 10% recommendation (in "The Life You Can Save") marks a crucial shift relevant to whether income-based thresholds can be principled rather than merely pragmatic compromises.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kagan defends an uncompromising consequentialism against common-sense morality, arguing that ordinary morality's limits on moral demands (agent-relative prerogatives, constraints against harming) lack adequate justification. Contra Scheffler, he contends that the personal point of view cannot justify permissions to do less than maximize the good. The demandingness objection fails because it simply asserts, rather than justifies, the legitimacy of personal concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Kagan represents the "bite the bullet" response to demandingness: accepting that morality really does demand sacrifices that ordinary morality deems supererogatory. This position sets the standard against which moderate responses (satisficing, thresholds, prerogatives) must be measured. For income vs. asset-based norms, Kagan's view implies neither is privileged - both are mere stopping points unless they maximize utility.

  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy introduces the "cooperative principle" as an alternative to simple consequentialism: the obligation of beneficence requires agents to contribute only their fair share toward achieving the best outcome, calculated on the assumption that others will also contribute their fair shares. This principle limits demands without appealing to agent-relative prerogatives, avoiding both excessive demandingness and the counterintuitive implications of satisficing.

  RELEVANCE: Murphy's cooperative principle provides the strongest theoretical foundation for percentage-based giving norms. If fair shares can be calculated as percentages of income (or wealth), then 10% pledges represent not arbitrary stopping points but principled distributions of the collective burden. This directly supports income-based over purely asset-based norms, as fair shares are naturally calculated from flows rather than stocks.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the 1993 cooperative principle into a systematic nonideal theory. When full compliance is not actual, moral principles must be adjusted to account for the partial compliance context. The cooperative principle applies even when others fail to contribute, but the calculation of fair shares must reflect realistic expectations about compliance. Murphy argues this avoids the "collectivization" problem where individual obligations depend implausibly on aggregate behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the practical challenge that most people do not give their fair share. For utilitarian giving norms, this raises the question: Should norms be calculated assuming full compliance (ideal theory) or actual partial compliance (nonideal theory)? Murphy's approach suggests that percentage-based pledges like 10% might be fair shares under ideal theory, but whether they suffice under nonideal theory depends on empirical compliance rates.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism in nonideal theory; bridges ideal moral principles with realistic expectations.

  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1982},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scheffler introduces "agent-centered prerogatives" - permissions to devote more weight to one's own projects and commitments than strict consequentialism allows. The prerogative is grounded in the independent normative significance of the personal point of view. Agents may permissibly favor their own interests by a certain proportional amount (M) relative to the impersonal good. This structure allows morality to make significant demands while avoiding the extremity of maximizing consequentialism.

  RELEVANCE: Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives provide the canonical alternative to Murphy's cooperative approach for limiting demandingness. The proportional weighting (M) could theoretically justify income-based thresholds: agents may retain M% of income for personal projects. However, Scheffler does not specify M's value, leaving the stopping point arbitrary. This framework better justifies qualitative limits (some giving required, not all) than quantitative thresholds (why 10% rather than 5% or 20%?).

  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity argues that extremely demanding principles of beneficence fail not because they conflict with agent-relative prerogatives, but because they generate an iterative problem: each act of beneficence creates circumstances calling for further beneficence, creating a regress that undermines the possibility of autonomous life-projects. The solution is a "life-shaping" constraint: beneficence must not expand to consume the agent's capacity for autonomous agency. This generates moderate, though still substantial, obligations to aid.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's "life-shaping" approach provides an alternative theoretical foundation for limited giving obligations that avoids both Murphy's dependence on others' compliance and Scheffler's unspecified proportional weighting. The autonomous agency constraint could justify percentage-based norms by defining the threshold at which giving begins to undermine life-projects. However, this threshold varies by individual circumstances, potentially supporting asset-based over uniform income-based norms.

  POSITION: Limited beneficence grounded in autonomous agency; distinct from both cooperative and prerogative-based approaches.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McElwee provides a taxonomic analysis of demandingness objections, distinguishing "cost-based" objections (morality requires too much sacrifice) from "directive force" objections (morality issues too many requirements). He argues that many alleged solutions to demandingness (like satisficing) only address one dimension while failing on the other. A successful response must explain both why certain costs are too demanding and why morality's directive authority has limits.

  RELEVANCE: McElwee's distinction between cost and directive force dimensions illuminates why simple percentage thresholds (like 10%) may not fully solve demandingness. Even if 10% isn't too costly for affluent agents, the continuous obligation to give may create excessive directive force - morality governing too much of life. This suggests that complete giving norms might need both quantitative thresholds (how much) and qualitative limits (when obligation applies).

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sobel argues that the demandingness objection cannot provide independent reason to reject consequentialism because it presupposes anti-consequentialist commitments in determining what counts as "too demanding." The objection must rely on prior judgments about which costs matter morally (personal projects vs. impartial good), but these judgments are precisely what's at issue between consequentialists and their critics. Thus the objection begs the question.

  RELEVANCE: If Sobel is correct, attempts to justify income-based vs. asset-based giving thresholds by appeal to demandingness may be circular: the choice already presupposes a view about whether personal wealth accumulation has moral standing independent of utility maximization. This suggests that the debate over giving norms must be settled on consequentialist grounds (which maximizes utility?) rather than by appeal to intuitions about excessive demands.

  doi = {10.26556/jesp.v28i2.3130},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: York argues that demandingness should be evaluated not just in the actual world but across possible worlds - theories are demanding to the extent they require significant sacrifices across a wide range of circumstances. This "modal demandingness" reveals that commonsense morality, despite appearing less demanding than consequentialism actually, may be extremely demanding in many possible worlds (e.g., where saving lives requires only minor sacrifices). This undermines purely cost-based demandingness objections.

  RELEVANCE: York's modal approach has implications for evaluating giving norms: income-based thresholds like 10% may appear reasonable in affluent societies but extremely demanding (or insufficiently demanding) in radically different economic circumstances. This suggests that robust giving norms should be formulated with sensitivity to modal variation - perhaps asset-based norms better track what agents can sacrifice across varied economic conditions.

  doi = {10.1093/0199256578.001.0001},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker defends rule-consequentialism: the right act is what would be required by the learnable set of rules whose internalization by the overwhelming majority would have the best consequences. This approach, Hooker argues, avoids act-consequentialism's demandingness while maintaining consequentialist foundations. The optimific code will include limited beneficence requirements because unlimited requirements would be unlearnable and would undermine agent motivation.

  RELEVANCE: Rule-consequentialism provides a structural explanation for why utilitarian giving norms should have defined thresholds rather than requiring giving to marginal utility equality. The "learnability" and "internalizability" constraints suggest that simple percentage-based rules (give 10% of income) are more likely part of the optimific code than complex asset-based formulas or unlimited requirements. This supports income-based norms on consequentialist grounds.

  doi = {10.1017/S0953820806001877},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bradley argues that satisficing consequentialism - which permits agents to aim for "good enough" outcomes rather than optimal ones - faces fatal objections. Crucially, satisficing permits agents to prevent better outcomes from obtaining, which violates the core consequentialist commitment that better outcomes are always preferable. Any coherent satisficing view must explain why it's permissible to block improvements, but no such explanation is compatible with genuine consequentialism.

  RELEVANCE: Bradley's critique challenges attempts to justify fixed giving thresholds (like 10% of income) on satisficing grounds. If giving 15% would produce better outcomes than 10%, satisficing seems to permit arbitrarily stopping at 10%, which conflicts with consequentialist foundations. This suggests that defensible income-based thresholds must be grounded in something other than satisficing - perhaps Murphy's cooperative principle or Hooker's rule-consequentialism.

  doi = {10.1007/s11406-021-00382-y},

  CORE ARGUMENT: McKay proposes a revised satisficing consequentialism that avoids Bradley's objection by incorporating an "effort ceiling" - agents must produce at least as much good as they could given how much effort they're exerting, but need not exert maximal effort. This allows satisficing to respond to demandingness (by limiting effort required) while avoiding the implication that agents may gratuitously prevent better outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: McKay's effort-based satisficing could justify giving norms based on effort constraints rather than fixed percentages. This might support more flexible norms than strict income-based thresholds: agents exerting high effort in careers with significant social value might have lower giving obligations than those in less socially valuable work, even at equal incomes. However, operationalizing "effort" comparisons seems challenging for practical giving norms.

  doi = {10.1007/BF00368395},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hurka distinguishes two versions of satisficing: "good enough" satisficing (achieving outcomes above a threshold) and "close enough" satisficing (achieving outcomes sufficiently close to optimal). He argues that only "good enough" satisficing is plausible, as "close enough" satisficing permits arbitrary choices between equally-close-to-optimal alternatives without principled justification.

  RELEVANCE: Hurka's distinction clarifies the theoretical options for threshold-based giving norms. "Good enough" satisficing would require giving sufficient to address poverty effectively (absolute threshold), while "close enough" satisficing would require giving close to the optimal amount (relative threshold). Income-based percentages might represent "good enough" thresholds if they achieve adequate aggregate relief, but this requires empirical validation that the threshold is actually sufficient.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hurka and Shubert defend agent-relative permissions via a "moving band" approach: the permission to favor oneself varies with the stakes involved. At low stakes, agents have wide permissions to favor personal interests; as stakes increase (more good at risk), permissions narrow. This avoids both implausible absolutism (same permission at all stakes) and the collapse into full consequentialism (no permissions at high stakes).

  RELEVANCE: The "moving band" structure could justify graduated giving obligations based on wealth levels: the very wealthy have narrower permissions to retain wealth than the moderately affluent. This might support progressive asset-based norms over flat income-based percentages - those with vast wealth have stronger obligations to give because the stakes (lives saved per dollar) are so high. The approach provides theoretical grounding for graduated rather than flat percentage pledges.

  doi = {10.1086/342859},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Portmore argues that agent-centered options can be accommodated within consequentialism by adopting "position-relative" consequentialism, which evaluates acts relative to agent-relative value rankings. On this view, it can be right for an agent to choose A over B even though B produces more impersonal value, because A produces more agent-relative value from that agent's perspective. This reconciles options with consequentialist structure.

  RELEVANCE: Position-relative consequentialism could justify different giving obligations for differently-situated agents on consequentialist grounds: agents with dependent children or local community ties might face different optimization functions than single cosmopolitans. This framework better supports context-sensitive asset-based norms than uniform income-based percentages, as agent-relative value depends on total resources and responsibilities, not just income flows.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Norcross defends "scalar consequentialism," which abandons deontic categories (right/wrong, obligatory/permissible) entirely in favor of purely scalar evaluation (better/worse). On this view, there are no obligations or permissions, only actions that produce more or less good. This dissolves the demandingness objection: there's nothing to be too demanding about if there are no demands, only a spectrum from better to worse actions.

  RELEVANCE: Scalar consequentialism radically reframes the question about giving norms: there's no threshold separating obligatory from supererogatory giving, just a continuum where more giving is always better. This challenges the very coherence of debates over whether 10% vs. 20% is "required" - all such questions dissolve into questions of degree. However, for practical purposes, scalar consequentialism provides no action-guidance on where to stop giving, which is precisely what giving pledges attempt to provide.

  RELEVANCE: Lazar's value-based grounding for options suggests that giving thresholds should be justified by their consequences for overall utility, including effects on agent motivation and social trust.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mikl\'{o}s and Tanyi propose "institutional consequentialism" as a response to demandingness: institutions, rather than individuals, should bear the consequentialist burden of maximizing utility. Individuals have obligations to establish and maintain appropriate institutions, but in functioning institutional contexts, individuals face only moderate demands. This shifts excessive demands from individual beneficence to institutional design and support.

  RELEVANCE: Institutional consequentialism suggests that individual giving obligations should be calibrated to existing institutional capacity: where effective poverty-relief institutions exist, individual obligations may be limited to tax support and modest supplemental giving; where institutions fail, individual obligations expand. This could justify variable giving norms across contexts rather than universal income-based percentages - higher individual giving obligations in contexts of institutional failure.

She argues that Hooker can maintain space for vagueness in what counts as "disaster" while avoiding over-demandingness. The optimific code need not specify precise thresholds, and this vagueness is a virtue rather than a vice.

  RELEVANCE: Woollard's defense of vague thresholds in rule-consequentialism has implications for giving norms: perhaps there's no precise answer to "exactly how much must I give?" compatible with rule-consequentialism. This could support ranges rather than fixed percentages (e.g., "give 5-15% of income") and explains why debates over exact thresholds (10% vs. 12%) may be misguided - the optimific code permits reasonable variation around a vague standard.

DOMAIN: Marginal Utility Theory — Income, Wealth, and Welfare

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The marginal utility of money is a foundational concept in welfare economics,
measuring how additional income or wealth affects individual wellbeing. Classical
economics established that marginal utility diminishes as consumption increases —
each additional dollar provides less utility than the previous one. However, the
debate over whether income and wealth have identical marginal utility functions
remains unresolved. Recent empirical research distinguishes between the flow of
income and the stock of wealth, suggesting they serve different functions in
household welfare: income supports consumption, while wealth provides insurance,
optionality, and positional status.

The elasticity of marginal utility of income has been extensively studied for
policy applications including taxation, social discounting, and redistribution.
Meta-analyses suggest values around 1.2-2.0, implying logarithmic or near-
logarithmic utility functions. However, wealth introduces additional complexity:
assets serve precautionary purposes against income shocks, enable intertemporal
smoothing, and function as positional goods where relative wealth matters.
This positional character may cause wealth to have lower marginal utility at
high levels than income, as additional assets beyond insurance needs primarily
signal status rather than enable new consumption.

Recent theoretical work examines how positional preferences affect capital
accumulation and welfare, while empirical studies investigate the relationship
between subjective well-being and both absolute income and relative wealth.
The insurance motive for wealth accumulation appears particularly strong for
households facing income uncertainty, but diminishes significantly once adequate
precautionary savings are established.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project's hypothesis that asset-based
giving norms may be more defensible than income-based norms under utilitarian
principles. If wealth has systematically lower marginal utility than income
(particularly at high wealth levels), then directing charitable obligations
toward assets rather than income flows could maximize aggregate welfare while
minimizing disruption to consumption patterns and labor incentives.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few studies directly compare the marginal utility of income versus wealth at
equivalent monetary values. The thresholds at which wealth transitions from
serving insurance functions to primarily positional functions remain poorly
quantified. The interaction between income uncertainty, wealth accumulation,
and marginal utility deserves more empirical investigation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this literature, distinguish carefully between theoretical
models of utility (which often conflate income and wealth) and empirical
findings (which increasingly recognize their distinct roles). The precautionary
savings literature provides strong evidence for the insurance value of wealth,
while the positional goods literature suggests diminishing returns at high
levels. Together, these strands support the hypothesis that marginal utility
of wealth declines more steeply than marginal utility of income.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical diminishing marginal utility (DMU): 8 papers - All income/wealth
  has declining marginal utility, supporting progressive redistribution
- Income vs. wealth distinction: 5 papers - Assets serve different functions
  than income flows, with implications for marginal utility
- Positional wealth effects: 5 papers - Relative wealth matters for utility,
  especially at high levels, suggesting steeper marginal utility decline

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using life satisfaction data across countries and within
  countries over time, the authors estimate that the elasticity of marginal
  utility of income is approximately 1.26, implying a logarithmic utility
  function. This means that a 1\% increase in income generates the same utility
  gain regardless of baseline income level. The finding is remarkably robust
  across different methodologies and datasets.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the empirical foundation for understanding how
  income affects welfare. The elasticity estimate near 1.0 supports using
  logarithmic utility in policy analysis. However, the paper does not distinguish
  between income and wealth effects, treating all monetary resources equivalently.
  This creates an opening for the research project to investigate whether wealth
  might have a different (steeper) elasticity than income flows.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Demonstrates that even individuals who are risk-loving (convex
  utility in wealth) still exhibit prudence — they accumulate precautionary
  savings against future income uncertainty. This surprising result shows that
  prudence (convex marginal utility) is more fundamental than risk aversion

  persists across different risk attitudes.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the theoretical foundation for why wealth accumulation
  responds to income uncertainty even when individuals are not particularly risk-
  averse. This supports the view that wealth serves an insurance function distinct
  from pure consumption. Once adequate insurance has been achieved, additional
  wealth may have lower marginal utility because the precautionary motive is
  satiated, while income continues to enable consumption.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses survey experiments to measure marginal propensity to consume
  from different types of income shocks. Finds enormous heterogeneity: some
  households spend nothing from windfall gains, while others spend most of it.
  Responses to losses are much larger and more widespread than responses to gains.
  A calibrated precautionary savings model with consumption adjustment costs can
  explain these patterns, particularly the role of low wealth levels in determining
  consumption responses.

  RELEVANCE: Provides direct evidence that wealth levels matter enormously for
  how households respond to income changes. Low-wealth households exhibit high
  marginal propensity to consume because they lack buffer stocks, while high-
  wealth households can smooth consumption. This asymmetry suggests that the
  marginal utility of wealth is much higher for low-wealth households (insurance
  motive) than for high-wealth households (who have adequate buffers). Critical
  for understanding threshold effects in wealth's marginal utility.

  POSITION: Represents the empirical household finance literature showing that
  wealth provides consumption insurance, with implications for marginal utility
  varying by wealth level.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes an economy where households care about both absolute
  wealth (for consumption and bequest motives) and relative wealth (for status).
  Shows that positional preferences lead to over-accumulation of capital relative
  to the social optimum because individuals don't internalize the negative
  externality of reducing others' relative position. The welfare loss from
  positional competition increases with the strength of status concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how wealth functions as a positional good,
  supporting the hypothesis that marginal utility of wealth may decline steeply
  at high levels because additional wealth primarily affects relative position
  rather than absolute welfare. This creates a wedge between private and social
  marginal utility of wealth. Relevant for understanding why asset-based giving
  norms might correct positional externalities.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that prioritarians should care about positional goods
  because they affect people's absolute wellbeing, not just their relative
  standing. When goods have positional characteristics, their value depends
  partly on scarcity, which creates genuine welfare differences. Prioritarians
  and egalitarians can converge on limiting access to positional goods even
  though they start from different moral premises.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for why utilitarian analysis
  should account for positional characteristics of wealth. If wealth is
  partially positional, then its marginal utility depends not only on absolute
  level but also on the distribution in society. This supports the project's
  investigation of whether asset-based norms might be more efficient than
  income-based norms when wealth has strong positional components.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Estimates the coefficient of relative risk aversion using
  happiness data from 75 countries in the Gallup World Poll. Finds that risk
  aversion clusters around 1 (logarithmic utility) across countries, validating
  the use of log utility in economic models. This consistency across diverse
  contexts suggests that logarithmic utility is a reasonable approximation for
  aggregate welfare analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides cross-country evidence supporting the logarithmic utility
  assumption that underlies much of the marginal utility literature. The finding
  that risk aversion ≈ 1 is consistent with marginal utility elasticity ≈ 1,
  supporting the Layard et al. estimates. However, like other studies, this does
  not distinguish between income and wealth, leaving open the question of whether

  different types of signaling and their welfare implications.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates concretely how wealth is used for positional signaling
  in actual consumption decisions. Wedding expenditure is a clear example where
  additional wealth goes toward relative position rather than absolute welfare,
  supporting the hypothesis that wealth's marginal utility declines steeply once
  basic needs and insurance are met. Provides a case study of how positional

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses panel data to show that education has both consumption
  value (direct utility from learning) and positional value (utility from

  life satisfaction depends not only on one's own education but also on the
  distribution of education in one's reference group. This positional character
  has implications for education policy.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates empirically that positional characteristics are not
  limited to luxury goods but extend to goods like education that are often
  considered primarily non-positional. This strengthens the case that wealth,
  which is more obviously used for status signaling, likely has even stronger
  positional components. Provides methodological insights for detecting
  positional effects in wellbeing data.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Turkish life satisfaction survey data to test two
  hypotheses: (1) income inequality within reference groups reduces happiness,
  and (2) housing functions as a positional good with negative externalities.
  Finds support for both hypotheses. The study shows that relative concerns
  matter substantially for wellbeing even in a middle-income country context.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence that housing (a major component of
  household wealth) operates as a positional good. Since housing is the largest
  asset for most households, this finding directly supports the hypothesis that
  wealth has positional characteristics. The negative effect of reference group
  inequality suggests that wealth redistribution could improve aggregate welfare
  by reducing positional competition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses laboratory experiments to test how land value taxation

  when it functions as a positional good, but this effect disappears when the
  positional indicator is removed. Surprisingly, participants voted for land
  value tax despite theoretical predictions of opposition.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates experimentally that the positional character of assets
  (land) drives overinvestment and inefficiency. Removing positional signaling
  eliminates the overinvestment, confirming that status concerns rather than
  consumption motives drive accumulation at high levels. This supports the
  hypothesis that marginal utility of wealth declines steeply when wealth
  primarily serves positional rather than consumption or insurance functions.

  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/xsqzp},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that a universal basic income (UBI) is less effective
  at maximizing welfare than a non-universal basic income that adjusts for prior
  income and wealth. The key insight is that diminishing marginal utility of
  money means that transfers should be concentrated on those with lowest resources,
  not distributed equally to all. A wealth-adjusted transfer scheme would better
  account for marginal utility differences.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applies diminishing marginal utility logic to policy design,
  arguing for wealth-adjusted rather than universal transfers. This parallels
  the research project's investigation of whether giving norms should be based
  on wealth rather than income. The paper's utilitarian framework and attention
  to marginal utility differences provides a model for how to analyze asset-based
  versus income-based norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes whether public provision of positional goods can
  correct inefficiencies from status competition. When consumers face a discrete
  choice between private and public alternatives, providing the public option
  for free or subsidized can reduce excessive consumption of positional goods.
  Shows conditions under which public provision can implement efficiency and
  when it serves as a useful second-best policy.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical framework for how policy can address positional
  externalities through public provision rather than taxation. While the paper
  focuses on public goods, the logic extends to policies that discourage
  accumulation of positional wealth. Relevant for understanding how norms or
  policies might channel resources away from positional wealth accumulation

  The paper distinguishes between utility-maximizing redistribution in theory

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops formal methods for comparing risk aversion across

  they are distinct but related concepts. More risk-averse individuals save more
  for precautionary reasons.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding how risk attitudes
  drive wealth accumulation. The link between risk aversion and precautionary
  savings supports the view that wealth serves an insurance function. Once
  adequate precautionary savings are achieved, the marginal utility of additional
  wealth falls because the insurance motive is satiated. This contributes to
  the hypothesis that wealth's marginal utility declines more steeply than

  CORE ARGUMENT: Shows that ignoring the precautionary savings motive leads to
  biased estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. When
  precautionary motives are properly accounted for, the elasticity estimates
  differ from standard approaches. This has implications for understanding how
  consumption responds to interest rate changes and income uncertainty.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights the importance of distinguishing between different
  motives for wealth accumulation when estimating utility parameters. The
  precautionary motive is particularly relevant for understanding how marginal
  utility of wealth varies with wealth levels: high at low wealth (where
  precautionary needs are unmet) but declining steeply once adequate insurance

  typically smaller than estimation errors in demand curves. Validates consumer
  surplus for empirical policy analysis.

DOMAIN: Effective Altruism and Contemporary Philanthropic Norms
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-06
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The effective altruism (EA) movement represents the contemporary mainstream
of utilitarian-inspired philanthropy, emphasizing evidence-based giving
to maximize impact. Central to EA is the Giving What We Can pledge, a
commitment to donate at least 10% of income to effective charities. The
movement emerged from Peter Singer's 1972 "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"
and was formalized through William MacAskill's work in the 2010s. Key debates
center on: (1) whether EA's focus on measurable impact neglects systemic
change, (2) the philosophical core of EA and its relationship to utilitarianism,
(3) the demandingness of utilitarian giving obligations, and (4) empirical
questions about what motivates sustained giving behavior. Recent critiques
question whether EA's income-based norms (like the 10% pledge) represent
optimal implementations of utilitarian principles or whether alternative
frameworks might better serve the movement's aims.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the "status quo" that the research project critiques.
Understanding EA's justifications for income-based giving norms—particularly
the 10% pledge—is essential for evaluating whether asset-based alternatives
might be more defensible on utilitarian grounds. The domain also reveals
gaps in EA literature regarding wealth versus income as giving bases.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
EA literature focuses almost exclusively on income-based giving with minimal
discussion of wealth or asset-based alternatives. Empirical research on
pledge-takers' characteristics exists, but little philosophical work examines
why income rather than wealth became the normative baseline. The movement's
practical focus on "earning to give" implicitly privileges income without
explicit normative defense.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare EA's implicit income-based framework with asset-based alternatives.
Note how EA literature emphasizes practical motivation and sustainability
(which may favor income-based norms) versus theoretical optimality. Consider
whether EA's origins in Singer's work predetermined income focus or whether
this represents an underexamined assumption.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- EA Core Tenets: 8 papers - Defining and defending EA's evidence-based approach
- Institutional Critique: 4 papers - Systemic change vs. individual giving
- Pledge Psychology: 3 papers - Empirical studies of giving behavior and motivation
- Demandingness Objections: 3 papers - How much are we obligated to give?

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. Applied to global poverty, this principle entails that affluent individuals have strong obligations to give substantially to famine relief, likely until giving more would cause comparable suffering. The argument challenges the distinction between duty and charity, proposing that preventing distant suffering is morally required, not supererogatory.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text establishing the moral case for substantial charitable giving that effective altruism builds upon. Singer's argument is income-focused—he discusses giving "until we reach the level of marginal utility" where our next dollar causes us as much suffering as it relieves. This income-centric framing may have shaped EA's default to income-based norms (like the 10% pledge) rather than wealth-based alternatives. The paper establishes the theoretical baseline against which the current project's asset-based proposal must be evaluated.

  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill popularizes effective altruism by arguing that we should use evidence and careful reasoning to determine how to benefit others as much as possible with our resources. He introduces the movement's core tenets: prioritization (focus on highest-impact causes), evidence-based evaluation of interventions, and "earning to give" (pursuing high-income careers to maximize donations). The book explicitly endorses the Giving What We Can 10% income pledge as a concrete standard.

  RELEVANCE: This is the key text establishing EA's contemporary norms and practices, including explicit endorsement of income-based giving standards. MacAskill frames "earning to give"—maximizing income to maximize donations—as a central EA strategy, implicitly privileging income over wealth as the relevant metric. The book never discusses asset-based giving or wealth taxes as alternatives, representing the income-centric default the current research questions. His defense of the 10% standard is primarily practical (sustainable, achievable) rather than theoretically optimal.

  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill articulates EA's philosophical core as using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. He distinguishes EA from mere consequentialism, arguing it's compatible with various moral theories. The definition emphasizes practical commitment alongside intellectual analysis, requiring both "figuring out" and "taking action." MacAskill clarifies common misconceptions: EA is not solely about poverty, not purely utilitarian, and doesn't ignore systemic change.

  RELEVANCE: This definitional work matters for the current project because it establishes what counts as within EA's scope. If EA is about maximizing benefit through evidence and reason, then examining whether income-based versus asset-based giving better serves this goal is central to EA philosophy. MacAskill's emphasis on practical action alongside theory suggests EA should be receptive to empirical arguments about giving metrics—yet the movement hasn't seriously considered wealth-based alternatives, representing a gap this research addresses.

  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey examines the "institutional critique" of EA—the objection that EA's focus on direct interventions (like malaria nets) neglects more fundamental institutional and systemic changes. He argues this critique often misunderstands EA's actual commitments and that EA is compatible with supporting institutional change. However, he acknowledges EA faces epistemic challenges in evaluating systemic interventions due to their complexity and long-term nature, which may explain EA's practical focus on measurable, short-term interventions.

  RELEVANCE: This debate illuminates why EA might favor income-based giving norms over systemic alternatives like wealth redistribution policies. Income-based individual giving offers clear, measurable impact, while wealth-based alternatives might require political/institutional change harder to evaluate. However, this practical epistemic limitation shouldn't preclude examining whether wealth-based norms would theoretically better serve EA's goals. The paper suggests EA may have pragmatically defaulted to income-based approaches without fully examining alternatives.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey identifies EA's philosophical core as requiring individuals to make significant contributions to benefiting others and to do so in ways that are optimific (or close to it) on empirically grounded assessments. He distinguishes this from stronger utilitarian commitments and argues EA is compatible with various moral theories. Berkey emphasizes that EA's practical guidance should be action-guiding for real people, not merely theoretically optimal, which may justify departures from pure utility maximization.

  RELEVANCE: Berkey's framework is crucial for evaluating income versus asset-based giving norms. If EA's core is "optimific giving based on empirical evidence," then the choice between income and wealth as the giving base should depend on which better serves this goal. His emphasis on "action-guiding for real people" might favor income-based norms if they're more psychologically sustainable—but this is an empirical question the current research can address. The paper reveals that EA's philosophical core doesn't inherently favor income over wealth; this choice needs independent justification.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pummer argues that even if we lack obligations to donate to charity, we may still have strong moral reasons to donate to highly effective charities over less effective ones. He defends the "effectiveness condition": if you're going to donate, you should donate where you'll do the most good. This conditional approach sidesteps demandingness objections while maintaining EA's core insight about prioritizing impact. Pummer argues this holds even for those who reject consequentialism or demanding utilitarian obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Pummer's framework shifts the question from "how much to give" to "given that we give, how to give effectively." This is highly relevant for comparing income versus asset-based norms: even if neither is strictly obligatory, if we're implementing giving norms, we should choose the metric that maximizes impact. His conditional approach suggests the income vs. wealth question remains important even for those rejecting demanding obligations. The paper's silence on whether giving norms should be income or wealth-based represents a gap the current research addresses.

  POSITION: Moderate EA position using conditional obligations to avoid demandingness objections while preserving effectiveness requirements.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically analyzes major critiques of EA, including: (1) it's too demanding, (2) it neglects justice and systemic change, (3) it's too focused on measurability, and (4) it's culturally imperialist. He argues many critiques misunderstand EA or conflate it with specific implementations. Gabriel distinguishes EA's "core commitments" (using reason and evidence to do good) from "common tendencies" (focus on global poverty, measurable interventions). He suggests EA can incorporate critics' valid concerns without abandoning its core.

  RELEVANCE: Gabriel's framework helps clarify which aspects of EA are essential versus contingent. If the 10% income pledge is a "common tendency" rather than "core commitment," then examining wealth-based alternatives is fully compatible with EA philosophy. His discussion of the "measurability bias" critique is relevant: EA might favor income-based giving partly because income flows are more easily measured than wealth stocks. This suggests EA's income focus may reflect epistemic convenience rather than normative superiority—a hypothesis the current research can test.

  POSITION: Sympathetic critical analysis distinguishing EA's essential commitments from contingent features.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This empirical study (N=536) examines personality and cognitive traits of people who've taken the Giving What We Can 10% income pledge compared to matched controls. Pledgers score higher on moral expansiveness, actively open-minded thinking, utilitarianism subscales, and fear recognition. They're lower on social dominance orientation and maximizing tendency. Results suggest pledge-takers have distinct psychological profiles characterized by impartial moral concern and analytical thinking, but findings on empathy/compassion were inconclusive.

  RELEVANCE: This is the only major empirical study of people who've adopted EA's flagship income-based giving norm (the 10% pledge). The psychological profile identified may be important for predicting whether similar individuals would adopt alternative wealth-based norms. The study assumes income-based giving as the dependent variable without considering whether wealth-based commitments might appeal to similar or different psychological profiles. This represents a research gap: would these same personality traits predict wealth-based giving commitments? The current project should consider these psychological realities in evaluating alternative norms.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal for income-based tithing (10% for most of the rich) on grounds of demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustice. He proposes a principle of progressive giving based on wealth rather than income: those with greater accumulated wealth should give proportionally more. Aloyo argues this better addresses fairness concerns (inherited vs. earned wealth), accounts for net financial position, and rectifies historical injustices. Progressive wealth-based giving fits EA's reasons better than flat income-based tithing.

  RELEVANCE: This is the only EA paper explicitly proposing wealth-based giving as an alternative to income-based norms. Aloyo's progressive wealth principle directly parallels the current project's inquiry into asset-based norms. His fairness arguments (wealth captures historical advantages better than income) and net worth arguments (focusing on income ignores assets/debts) provide philosophical support for wealth-based alternatives. However, Aloyo focuses on fairness/justice concerns rather than pure utilitarian optimization, leaving open whether wealth-based norms better maximize utility—the current project's central question.

  POSITION: Progressive wealth-based giving as a fairer, more just alternative to EA's income-based tithing proposal.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lichtenberg analyzes EA's relationship to consequentialism, arguing that most EA understandings imply consequentialist commitments despite EA's self-description as theory-neutral. She distinguishes the view that we're obligated to maximize the good from the view that producing more good is always morally better, arguing the latter is essential to any consequentialist theory. Lichtenberg examines the demandingness objection and EA's clash with common-sense morality regarding personal projects and special relationships.

  RELEVANCE: Lichtenberg's analysis helps clarify what utilitarian commitments require regarding charitable giving. If consequentialism requires that "producing more good is always morally better," then the choice between income and wealth-based giving norms should depend on which produces more good—not on which is more convenient or intuitive. Her discussion of demandingness suggests both income and wealth-based norms face similar objections; neither framework inherently resolves the demandingness problem. The paper highlights that EA must ultimately appeal to consequentialist reasoning to justify any giving norm.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Chappell defends EA's core "beneficentric" ideas against recent backlash, arguing that wanting to effectively benefit others is excellent and widely neglected. He addresses common objections: EA isn't inherently utilitarian, doesn't require perfect impartiality, and is compatible with caring about systemic change. Chappell emphasizes that reasonable people can disagree on implementation details while sharing EA's basic values: helping others and doing so effectively matters morally.

  RELEVANCE: Chappell's defense of EA's "core ideas" as separable from specific implementations supports examining alternative giving norms. If EA's essence is "benefit others effectively using evidence," then the income versus wealth question is precisely the kind of implementation detail EA should investigate empirically. His emphasis on EA being "widely neglected" suggests there's value in expanding EA thinking to under-examined domains—like the choice of giving metrics. The paper's focus on defending EA against critics rather than examining internal alternatives represents a characteristic feature of EA literature.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz reframes the institutional critique of EA by arguing it's best understood as claiming EA relies on an overly individualistic approach, neglecting collective obligations. He argues EA can incorporate attention to collective obligations while maintaining its focus on individual action. Dietz suggests EA is "incomplete" rather than mistaken—it captures important truths about individual obligations but needs to be supplemented with an account of collective action and institutional change.

  RELEVANCE: Dietz's framework is relevant for thinking about giving norms. Both individual income-based giving and collective wealth taxation represent ways of implementing beneficent obligations. If EA's incompleteness stems from excessive individualism, examining wealth-based alternatives requires considering both individual wealth-based giving and collective mechanisms (wealth taxes). The current project should assess whether moving from income to wealth as a giving base simply shifts between individual/collective frames or whether wealth-based approaches inherently require more collective action.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rubenstein critically examines EA's approach to global poverty from the perspective of political ethics and humanitarian practice. She identifies valuable lessons from EA (emphasis on evidence, outcomes, impartiality) but argues EA undervalues process-oriented concerns like participation, voice, and dignity. Rubenstein suggests effective humanitarianism requires balancing outcome maximization with respect for beneficiaries' agency and local knowledge. She questions whether EA's emphasis on measurability biases it toward interventions that can be easily quantified.

  RELEVANCE: Rubenstein's critique of EA's "measurability bias" is directly relevant to the income versus wealth question. Income flows are more readily measurable than wealth stocks, which may partly explain EA's income focus. If wealth-based norms would actually produce better outcomes but are harder to measure and monitor, EA might systematically undervalue them due to epistemic convenience. This suggests the current research should carefully examine not just the theoretical superiority of wealth-based norms but also their practical measurability and enforceability.

  pages = {88--115},
  doi = {10.1086/706867},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lechterman argues that EA faces a fundamental political problem: its emphasis on impartial, consequentialist reasoning about giving conflicts with the partial, relational commitments essential to democratic citizenship. By treating all beneficiaries as equally deserving regardless of political relationship, EA potentially undermines the bonds of mutual obligation that sustain democratic communities. Lechterman doesn't reject EA but argues it needs to be reconciled with legitimate partiality toward fellow citizens.

  RELEVANCE: This political critique has implications for income versus wealth-based giving norms. If EA's political problem stems from excessive impartiality, wealth-based norms might face similar objections—they don't inherently solve the tension between impartial beneficence and democratic partiality. However, wealth taxation represents a collective, political mechanism that might better align with democratic values than individualized income-based giving. The current project should consider whether wealth-based approaches offer any advantages in addressing EA's political legitimacy.

  number = {2},
  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques "Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism" (OOEA)—the subset of EA viewing effectiveness-maximizing giving as morally obligatory. She argues OOEA's emphasis on helping distant strangers over local communities is intuitively wrong and undermines solidarity. As an alternative, Pearlman proposes Mutual Aid: community-based networks of reciprocal support emphasizing empathy, solidarity, and care rather than impartial cost-effectiveness. She argues we have no obligation to use funds "effectively" in EA's sense; rather, we have broader obligations to address suffering that Mutual Aid fulfills.

  RELEVANCE: Pearlman's critique targets EA's income-based framework but from a different angle than the current project. Where this project asks whether wealth-based norms would better serve utilitarian goals, Pearlman questions utilitarian/impartialist goals themselves. However, her critique is relevant because it highlights how EA's focus on individual monetary donations (whether income or wealth-based) may neglect alternative forms of beneficence (time, care, community-building). The current project should acknowledge that even optimally-designed wealth-based norms face these broader critiques of the charity framework itself.

  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904083},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In contrast to Pearlman's rejection of EA, Mouser argues that mutual aid and EA are complementary rather than opposed. EA's strategy of donating to effective charities is politically short-sighted, keeping activists on a "firefighter's treadmill" of addressing symptoms. Mutual aid offers a superior long-term strategy for effective altruists: building power through solidarity to enable systemic change. Mouser argues mutual aid is more politically effective than individual charitable giving, thus better serving EA's ultimate goal of maximizing positive impact.

  RELEVANCE: Mouser's argument suggests EA's strategic approach (individual donations) rather than its goal (maximum positive impact) may be the problem. This has implications for income versus wealth-based norms: perhaps both frameworks are similarly limited because they focus on individual resource transfers rather than collective power-building. However, wealth taxation could represent a collective mechanism bridging individual wealth-based giving and systemic change. The current project should consider whether wealth-based approaches enable different types of political action than income-based ones.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines ethical questions in philanthropy from multiple perspectives, including consequentialist, deontological, and virtue-ethical approaches. Contributors address questions about: who should give, how much, to whom, and through what mechanisms. The volume predates EA's mainstream emergence but addresses foundational questions about philanthropic obligations that EA later popularized. Topics include the relationship between charity and justice, duties to distant strangers, and institutional versus individual approaches to beneficence.

  RELEVANCE: This volume represents pre-EA philosophical work on giving obligations, providing historical context for EA's innovations and gaps. The absence of sustained discussion about income versus wealth as giving bases in pre-EA philanthropy ethics suggests this wasn't a central question before EA—or that EA's income focus inherited an unexamined default. The volume's emphasis on "who should give" (identifying moral agents) rather than "from what resources" (income vs. wealth) reveals a lacuna that remains in contemporary EA literature.

  doi = {10.1287/MNSC.2020.3811},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andreoni and Serra-Garcia investigate why revocable pledges (like the GWWC pledge) can effectively increase charitable giving despite being non-binding. Using theory and experiments, they show pledges serve as screening devices: people who pledge reveal information about their giving motives, allowing nonprofits to target interventions (like gratitude expressions) more effectively. This reduces reneging and increases overall giving. The value of pledges lies not in commitment power but in information revelation that enables better donor management.

  RELEVANCE: This economic analysis of pledge effectiveness is highly relevant for understanding EA's 10% income pledge. If pledges work through information revelation and screening rather than commitment, then the choice of pledge metric (income vs. wealth) might matter less than the pledge's ability to screen donors and enable effective follow-up. However, this assumes both income and wealth-based pledges would screen similarly—an empirical question. The paper's focus on pledge mechanisms without questioning the income basis reveals another gap: behavioral economics of pledges hasn't examined alternative giving metrics.

  pages = {238--257},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820823000055},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Buchak examines how risk aversion and ambiguity aversion should affect charitable giving decisions under uncertainty. She argues that even if expected value theory is the correct decision theory, rational risk aversion provides reasons to diversify donations across organizations rather than giving everything to the seemingly most effective one. Similarly, ambiguity aversion justifies supporting proven interventions over uncertain high-upside possibilities. Buchak shows these attitudes can be rational and should inform EA giving strategies.

  RELEVANCE: Buchak's analysis of risk and uncertainty in giving decisions has implications for income versus wealth-based norms. Wealth stocks are less volatile than income flows, potentially making wealth-based giving more predictable for charities. However, implementing wealth-based norms might involve greater measurement uncertainty and political risk. The current project should consider how risk and ambiguity attitudes affect the comparative appeal of income versus wealth-based frameworks, both for donors (pledge-takers) and beneficiaries (charities).

DOMAIN: Wealth Ethics, Asset Inequality, and Distributive Justice

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the distinctive moral questions raised by wealth
accumulation and asset holdings, as opposed to income flows. Central
debates concern whether there is a distinct ethics of wealth beyond
income ethics, whether asset holdings generate special obligations,
and how inheritance shapes intergenerational inequality. Key positions
include libertarian defenses of bequest rights, egalitarian critiques
emphasizing wealth's role in replicating inequality, and limitarian
views proposing upper bounds on permissible wealth. The literature
also engages with whether wealth concentration undermines democratic
equality and whether asset redistribution through taxation or other
means is normatively required.

Recent work has focused on the intersection of wealth inequality and
political power, the ethics of offshore wealth management, and whether
inheritance is morally distinctive from other transfers. Philosophers
have debated whether wealth's intergenerational transmission creates
special justice concerns beyond those arising from income inequality
alone, and whether holdings (stocks) versus flows require different
normative treatment.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether utilitarian giving obligations
should target income or assets. If wealth holdings generate distinct
obligations beyond those arising from income—due to inheritance effects,
concentration of economic power, or differential marginal utility—then
income-based giving norms may be inadequate. The literature provides
independent (non-utilitarian) grounds for treating assets differently,
which may either reinforce or complicate utilitarian prescriptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers explicitly compare income-based versus asset-based frameworks
for philanthropic obligation. Most work addresses taxation and state
redistribution rather than individual giving. Limited engagement with
how marginal utility considerations interact with non-utility reasons
for asset-focused redistribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish arguments from marginal utility (which
apply to both income and wealth) from arguments specific to wealth's
distinctive features (inheritance, political power, market structure).
Consider how non-utilitarian concerns about wealth concentration might
modify or complement utilitarian giving prescriptions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Inheritance skepticism: 6 papers - Wealth transfer perpetuates unjust inequality
- Limitarianism: 3 papers - Upper limits on permissible wealth holdings
- Libertarian bequest rights: 2 papers - Property rights extend to bequests
- Asset taxation: 4 papers - Wealth taxes as mechanism of redistribution
- Democratic equality: 3 papers - Wealth threatens political equality

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198803355.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Halliday argues that inheritance is unjust to the extent
  that it enhances the intergenerational replication of inequality. While
  he acknowledges some bequest rights, he contends that unlimited inheritance
  concentrates wealth across generations and undermines fair equality of
  opportunity. The book examines whether inheritance is morally distinctive
  from other property uses and concludes that its intergenerational effects
  create special justice concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's focus on whether assets
  versus income generate different obligations. Halliday's analysis suggests
  that wealth holdings have distinctive normative features due to their
  intergenerational transmission—a dimension absent from income-based
  approaches. This provides non-utilitarian grounds for asset-focused
  philanthropy or redistribution, though Halliday emphasizes taxation
  over voluntary giving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietsch analyzes the ethical challenges of tax competition
  and capital mobility, arguing that individuals and corporations should pay

  tax-setting by states should be limited and proposes an international tax
  organization to enforce principles of tax justice. The book defends these
  reforms against efficiency objections and argues they enhance rather than
  constrain sovereignty.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the institutional framework for wealth taxation and
  redistribution. Relevant to the project because it examines whether the
  globally mobile nature of wealth creates distinctive obligations. If
  capital flight undermines traditional redistributive mechanisms, this may
  affect whether income-based or asset-based giving norms are more feasible

  pages = {172--200},
  doi = {10.1017/s0265052502191084},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arneson argues that justice requires transfers to offset
  both income and wealth inequalities, grounding this requirement in a
  responsibility-sensitive egalitarian framework. He contends that one's
  wealth and income determine what one can purchase from markets, and that
  fair equality of opportunity demands offsetting inequalities arising from
  circumstances beyond individual control. Both income flows and wealth
  stocks affect opportunity and should be subject to redistributive transfers.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the distinction between income and wealth
  from an egalitarian perspective. Arneson treats both as relevant to justice
  but does not fully develop how their different temporal structures (flow
  vs. stock) might generate different obligations. His framework supports
  the project's investigation by showing that both income and wealth matter
  for opportunity, leaving open whether they should be treated differently
  in giving norms.

  title = {Capital without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent},
  year = {2016},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Based on ethnographic research, Harrington examines how
  wealth managers help the ultra-wealthy avoid taxes, creditors, and legal
  obligations through offshore structures. She reveals the professional
  culture that enables massive wealth shielding while staying within legal
  boundaries, arguing that these practices erode government authority and
  exacerbate global inequality. The book demonstrates how elite capital
  mobility operates through specialized professional intermediaries.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals the practical mechanisms by which wealth escapes
  redistributive obligations, whether through taxation or voluntary giving.
  This empirical insight matters for the project because it shows that
  asset-based obligations face unique enforcement challenges compared to
  income-based ones. If wealth can more easily evade obligations through
  offshore structures, this may favor income-focused giving norms despite
  theoretical arguments for wealth-based approaches.

  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.11647/obp.0130},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Robeyns develops the capability approach and introduces
  "limitarianism"—the view that there should be upper limits on how much
  wealth individuals may hold. She argues that extreme wealth concentration
  is unjust because it: (1) could meet urgent unmet needs elsewhere,
  (2) undermines political equality, and (3) reflects objectionable political
  processes. Limitarianism complements sufficientarianism by setting both
  floors and ceilings on distribution.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant because limitarianism specifically targets
  wealth holdings rather than income flows. This represents a clear case
  where assets (stocks) are thought to generate obligations distinct from
  those arising from income. If limitarianism is correct, then asset-based
  giving norms may be more appropriate than income-based ones for addressing
  excessive wealth concentration. However, Robeyns emphasizes institutional

  CORE ARGUMENT: Chan explores how Confucian ethics might support limitarian
  principles by presenting limitarianism as a pragmatic approach to economic
  equality consistent with Confucian ideals. He examines how both traditions
  relate to sufficientarianism and how cross-cultural dialogue can enrich
  understanding of wealth limits. The paper bridges Eastern and Western
  approaches to wealth concentration.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how non-Western ethical traditions may independently
  support wealth-focused (rather than income-focused) redistribution. This
  cross-cultural perspective strengthens the case that wealth holdings have
  distinctive moral significance beyond what utilitarian calculus alone would
  suggest. The dialogue with Confucianism may also illuminate alternative
  frameworks for individual giving obligations.

  Confucian-limitarian synthesis.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Penner examines whether the "hereditary principle"—the
  idea that property can be transmitted across generations—is compatible
  with intergenerational justice. He analyzes the tension between bequest
  rights rooted in property theory and concerns about perpetuating inequality
  across generations. The paper considers whether limits on inheritance are
  required by justice to future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Connects inheritance to intergenerational justice concerns,
  showing how wealth transmission affects not only contemporaries but future
  persons. This temporal dimension distinguishes wealth from income and may
  generate distinct obligations. If current wealth concentration harms future
  generations' opportunities, this provides an additional reason (beyond
  marginal utility) for asset-based rather than income-based redistribution.

  journal = {Economics and Philosophy},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors defend Mill's proposal for wealth transfer
  taxation: individuals should be free to bequeath but not to receive large
  bequests. They argue this scheme balances respect for testator autonomy
  with concern for equality of opportunity among the next generation. By
  taxing recipients rather than estates, Mill's approach addresses wealth
  concentration while preserving some bequest rights.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a philosophical defense of treating wealth transfers
  differently from ordinary income or consumption. The focus on recipient-side
  taxation reflects concern with how wealth holdings affect opportunity,
  distinct from concerns about income flows. This distinction is directly
  relevant to whether giving norms should target income or assets—Mill's

  CORE ARGUMENT: Huemer argues that taxation for redistributive purposes
  violates property rights, responding to claims that individuals lack
  ownership of pretax income. He defends the libertarian view that property
  rights extend to wealth holdings and that redistributive taxation—whether
  on income or wealth—constitutes rights violations. Huemer rejects the idea
  that justice requires offsetting wealth inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the opposing libertarian position that denies
  distinctive obligations arising from wealth holdings. From this view,
  neither income nor assets generate mandatory redistributive obligations,
  whether through taxation or giving. This position challenges the premise
  that wealth concentration per se creates justice concerns, though it allows
  for voluntary philanthropy. The debate with egalitarians like Arneson and
  Halliday frames the project's central question.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Flanigan and Freiman argue against proposals to limit

  and harm economic productivity. They respond to Robeyns's limitarianism by
  defending the permissibility of unlimited wealth accumulation, arguing that
  the wealthy often create value for others and that limiting wealth would
  reduce overall prosperity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the counterargument to limitarianism and wealth-focused
  redistribution. If Flanigan and Freiman are correct that extreme wealth is
  permissible, this would undermine asset-based giving norms unless they can
  be justified on purely utilitarian grounds (marginal utility). However,
  their focus on value creation may still support voluntary giving by the

  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmer defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for

  generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another generation,
  but deprivation does not always have lexical priority. He proposes both
  deprivation and affluence thresholds and examines how to balance
  distributive concerns across generations.

  RELEVANCE: Bears on the project because intergenerational wealth transfer
  affects how current assets translate into future opportunities. If
  preventing deprivation in future generations has priority, this may support
  wealth-based giving (which affects intergenerational transfers) over
  income-based giving. However, Timmer's framework applies to both income and

  CORE ARGUMENT: Volacu examines the "democratic argument" for limitarianism—
  that excessive wealth damages democracy through political inequality. He
  questions whether the standard version of this argument succeeds and proposes
  a revised account focused on democratic resilience rather than simply
  political equality. The paper explores how wealth concentration undermines
  democratic institutions beyond its effects on formal political equality.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights a non-utilitarian reason why wealth (as opposed to
  income) might merit special normative treatment: its effects on political
  power and democratic governance. This consideration would not apply equally
  to income flows, suggesting that wealth holdings create distinctive
  obligations. However, this democratic concern primarily justifies
  institutional limits rather than individual giving obligations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using London housing data, the authors demonstrate how
  international "wealth chains"—offshore investment vehicles and wealth
  management structures—anchor capital in luxury property markets. They argue
  these mechanisms shield wealth from taxation and regulation, converting
  housing from homes into assets for accumulation. This process benefits the
  wealthy while exacerbating inequality and housing scarcity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence of how wealth holdings operate
  differently from income flows: wealth uses sophisticated legal structures
  to escape obligations and reshape markets. This practical distinction
  between assets and income bears on the feasibility of different giving
  norms—asset-based approaches must contend with wealth's capacity for
  structural shielding. The housing focus also shows how wealth concentration

  RELEVANCE: Addresses practical distinctions between taxing income versus
  wealth, showing that wealth's illiquid and fluctuating nature creates

  different forms of taxation.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies whether the libertarian position treats wealth
  transfers differently from income, or whether both are equally protected by

  targets wealth holdings rather than income flows for redistributive
  obligations. Islamic zakat principles distinguish sharply between income
  and wealth in calculating obligations, offering a model for asset-based
  giving norms. This religious tradition's focus on wealth stocks rather than

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wilson examines the ethics of "philanthrocapitalism"—
  ultra-wealthy individuals applying business methods to large-scale
  philanthropy. He analyzes whether massive giving by billionaires (especially
  the Gates Foundation) should be celebrated or critiqued, arguing that such
  philanthropy is only possible under extreme wealth inequality. Wilson
  considers whether giving can be a duty or remains discretionary, and how to
  ethically assess large-scale private philanthropy's effects on global health.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether extreme wealth holdings create giving
  obligations versus being permissible if wealth is philanthropically deployed.
  The tension Wilson identifies—philanthropy depends on inequality that may
  itself be unjust—bears on whether asset-based giving norms can be justified
  independently of addressing wealth concentration through taxation. The global

  activities and distinguishes ethical from unethical profit-seeking.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about distributive justice, Young's emphasis
  on wealth creation as an ethical standard bears on how we should evaluate
  wealth holdings. If wealth creation has independent ethical significance
  (beyond distribution), this might affect whether accumulated assets should

DOMAIN: Time-Discounting, Deferred Giving, and Investment Ethics
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-06
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 7, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef, Web
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the temporal dimension of philanthropic decision-making,
focusing on whether to donate now or invest for larger future donations. The
literature addresses three interconnected questions: (1) the normative status
of pure time preference in ethics and public policy, (2) the practical
parameters affecting "give now versus later" decisions (investment returns,
cause timing, future uncertainty), and (3) the ethical implications of
endowments and patient philanthropy strategies.

The debate over pure time preference has roots in foundational work by Broome,
Parfit, and others who argued that discounting future well-being merely
because it occurs in the future is ethically indefensible. Recent work
(Lowry & Peterson, Mogensen, Beard & Kaczmarek) has challenged this consensus,
arguing for circumstances where time preference may be rational or justified.
The climate economics literature (Stern, Groom et al.) demonstrates the
practical stakes of these debates through social discount rate controversies.

The "give now versus later" question has gained prominence through effective
altruism discussions. MacAskill's analysis identifies key parameters: expected
investment returns, the rate of diminishing marginal utility of money donated
to a cause, correlation between investment returns and cause importance, and
existential risk. Cordelli and Reich examine the intergenerational justice
implications of philanthropic timing, particularly regarding endowments that
defer giving to benefit future generations. Core and Donaldson introduce the
proximity preference framework for understanding charitable allocation across
both distance and time.

Recent work on impact investing (Harris) and venture philanthropy suggests
that the choice is not binary—patient investors may hold mission-correlated
assets that provide both financial returns and strategic value for future
giving opportunities.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether asset-based utilitarian giving norms
should incorporate deferred donation strategies. If utilitarian obligations
permit or require investing assets to maximize total donations over time, this
has implications for: (1) whether asset thresholds should trigger immediate
liquidation and donation, (2) how to weigh present need against potentially
larger future donations, and (3) whether patient philanthropy is consistent
with utilitarian urgency to reduce suffering.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature lacks direct engagement with how asset-based versus income-based
giving norms interact with temporal donation strategies. There is limited
empirical work on how actual donors navigate give-now-versus-later tradeoffs
across different wealth levels. The role of liquidity constraints and
consumption smoothing in optimal giving timing deserves more attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, distinguish between: (1) pure philosophical arguments about
time preference, (2) empirical parameters in climate/public economics that
inform social discount rates, (3) practical EA frameworks for individual donor
decisions, and (4) institutional questions about endowments and foundations.
The interaction between time-discounting and asset-versus-income norms may
reveal whether asset-based obligations create pressure toward deferred giving
that income-based norms avoid.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Anti-discounting consensus (Broome, Parfit, Rawls): 7 papers - Pure time
  preference is ethically indefensible; future well-being should not be
  discounted merely due to temporal location
- Qualified defense of time preference (Lowry & Peterson, Mogensen): 3 papers -
  Some forms of time preference may be rational or justified by partiality
- Give-now advocates: 3 papers - Uncertainty, urgency, and risk of value drift
  favor immediate giving
- Patient philanthropy: 5 papers - Investment, strategic timing, and
  mission-correlated assets can justify deferred giving

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Broome argues that discounting future benefits in
  cost-benefit analysis is not justified by pure time preference—the view that
  a benefit is less valuable merely because it occurs in the future. He
  distinguishes between discounting for diminishing marginal utility and
  discounting for uncertainty, which may be legitimate, and pure time
  preference, which he argues is ethically arbitrary. The paper provides a
  philosophical foundation for debates about the social discount rate in
  climate economics and intergenerational justice.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper establishes the anti-discounting position
  that is central to debates about deferred giving. If pure time preference is
  ethically indefensible, then utilitarian obligations to give cannot be
  weakened simply because donations would occur in the future. This has direct
  implications for whether investing to give later can be justified on
  utilitarian grounds—it must be defended by appeal to investment returns or
  strategic timing, not by discounting future beneficiaries' interests.

  in debates about climate policy and intergenerational obligations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cordelli and Reich examine the intergenerational justice
  implications of philanthropic endowments—institutional structures that defer
  giving to benefit future generations. They argue that endowments raise
  questions about whether current donors have obligations to address present

  intergenerational resource allocation is democratically legitimate. The
  chapter distinguishes between individual deferred giving and institutional
  perpetuity.

  RELEVANCE: This work directly addresses the temporal dimension of giving
  norms. The tension they identify between present obligation and future impact
  is central to evaluating whether asset-based utilitarian norms should permit
  or require investment strategies. Their democratic concerns about endowments
  may extend to individual patient philanthropy if wealthy donors defer giving

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reich extends his analysis of philanthropy's temporal
  dimension, arguing that perpetual endowments represent a problematic
  extension of donor control across generations. He contends that while
  individuals may permissibly defer giving through investment, institutional
  structures that lock in donor intent indefinitely raise democratic legitimacy
  concerns. The chapter examines alternative models including sunset
  provisions and mission flexibility.

  RELEVANCE: Reich's work helps distinguish between individual deferred giving
  decisions (which may be justified by strategic considerations) and
  institutional perpetuity (which raises governance concerns). For asset-based
  utilitarian norms, this suggests that while investing to give later may be
  permissible for individuals, creating permanent structures that defer giving
  across generations may be more problematic.

  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill provides a framework for the "give now versus give
  later" decision within effective altruism. He identifies four key parameters:
  (1) expected investment returns, (2) the rate of diminishing marginal utility
  of money donated to a cause (which reflects both funding growth and solved
  problems), (3) correlation between investment returns and cause importance,
  and (4) existential risk. He argues that for many causes with rapidly
  diminishing returns to funding, giving now is likely optimal, but patient
  philanthropy may be justified for emerging or speculative causes.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most direct analysis of deferred giving within the
  utilitarian framework most relevant to the project. MacAskill's framework
  reveals that the give-now-versus-later decision depends on empirical
  parameters, not just pure time preference. For asset-based giving norms,
  this suggests that optimal timing may vary by cause area and individual
  circumstances, rather than supporting a uniform immediate-liquidation rule.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lowry and Peterson challenge the anti-discounting consensus
  established by Sidgwick, Ramsey, Rawls, and Parfit. They argue that pure
  time preference—preferring something merely because of when it occurs—is not
  always irrational. They defend limited time preference on grounds including
  personal projects, uncertainty about future preferences, and the
  phenomenology of temporal experience. Their defense is qualified and does not
  extend to all contexts.

  RELEVANCE: This paper challenges the philosophical foundation for the view
  that deferred giving cannot be justified by time preference alone. If some
  forms of time preference are rational, this potentially opens space for
  donors to weight present donations more heavily than the anti-discounting
  view permits. However, their qualified defense may not extend to
  intergenerational contexts relevant to philanthropy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mogensen examines whether "discounting for kinship"—giving
  greater weight to nearer generations due to agent-relative reasons of

  preference. He responds to Parfit's objections and argues that partiality
  between generations may provide the only plausible ethical argument for
  discounting future well-being. He remains skeptical that this argument
  succeeds but treats it as the strongest case for time preference.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explores whether agent-relative reasons could justify
  preferring present over future beneficiaries in philanthropic contexts. For
  asset-based giving norms, this raises the question of whether donors have
  stronger obligations to present versus future recipients, potentially
  supporting immediate giving over investment strategies even when expected

  doi = {10.1017/S0953820823000109},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beard and Kaczmarek argue that in the context of existential
  risk and vast future populations, some degree of pure time preference may be
  reasonable. They identify three considerations: the asymmetry of causal
  influence (we can only affect the future), the distribution of benefits from
  using spacetime as a resource, and the burdens of care given the former two.
  Surprisingly, they find that time preference may not weaken the case for
  existential risk mitigation as commonly assumed.

  RELEVANCE: This recent work challenges assumptions about how time preference
  affects long-term cause prioritization. For asset-based giving norms, it
  suggests that even if some time preference is justified, this may not
  necessarily favor present over future donations in all cause areas—
  particularly those related to existential risk or long-term trajectories.

  POSITION: Novel argument for limited time preference compatible with
  longtermist priorities; challenges conventional wisdom about time preference

  CORE ARGUMENT: Core and Donaldson develop a framework for understanding
  charitable allocation decisions across both physical distance and temporal
  distance. They introduce the concept of "proximity preference"—the tendency
  to favor recipients who are closer in space, psychic identity, or time. They
  examine how US donors allocate between present and future beneficiaries,
  particularly through endowments serving wealthy versus needy populations, and
  argue that while donor preferences matter, recipient need should be the
  dominant factor.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explicitly connects spatial and temporal dimensions of
  giving, providing a framework for understanding how proximity preferences
  might affect asset-based versus income-based norms. If donors exhibit
  temporal proximity preference, this could favor immediate giving over
  investment strategies, independent of economic or strategic considerations.
  The paper's normative stance prioritizing need over proximity supports
  focusing on cause effectiveness rather than timing per se.

  POSITION: Economic and ethical analysis emphasizing need over proximity
  preferences; critical of endowments favoring wealthy future recipients.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Groom et al. provide a comprehensive review of the academic
  literature on long-term social discount rates, emphasizing how small changes
  in the discount rate have enormous effects on the evaluation of projects with
  long time horizons (climate mitigation, infrastructure, etc.). They examine

  parallels in give-now-versus-later decisions for individual donors. The

  pages = {93--113},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-financial-101822-112948},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Caplin and Leahy analyze how market interest rates may not
  reflect population-wide discount rates when some market participants are
  missing—either current participants (like constrained borrowers) or future
  participants (future generations). They argue that missing current
  participants implies average discount rates above market rates, while missing
  future participants implies rates below market rates. They examine
  implications for social discount rate policy, including the role of legacy
  preferences and intergenerational altruism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a sophisticated analysis of how discount rates
  should account for participants absent from current markets, including future
  beneficiaries of philanthropy. For asset-based giving norms, this suggests
  that market returns alone may not determine optimal giving timing—altruistic
  donors must consider that future beneficiaries cannot currently "bid" for
  resources. The legacy utility discussion may be relevant to motivations for
  deferred giving.

  journal = {SSRN Working Paper},

  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3939991},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harris develops a general equilibrium model combining
  investment, production, and non-pecuniary impact considerations. He shows
  that investors with high urgency make substantial allocations to pure
  philanthropy, while more patient investors tilt toward mission-correlated
  assets—investments whose financial returns correlate with positive
  developments in their impact opportunity set. The model demonstrates that
  "investing for impact" does not mean pure impact investing but rather
  strategic portfolio construction considering impact returns alongside
  financial returns.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges the give-now-versus-later decision with
  portfolio construction for impact-motivated investors. It suggests that the
  choice is not binary between immediate donation and standard investment, but
  includes intermediate strategies of holding mission-correlated assets. For
  asset-based giving norms, this implies that optimal asset management may
  differ from both immediate liquidation and wealth maximization, depending on
  the correlation between investment returns and cause trajectories.

  POSITION: Financial economics model of impact investing; emphasizes patient
  philanthropy through strategic asset allocation rather than immediate giving.

  doi = {10.1086/688584},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Asheim and Nesje demonstrate a paradoxical result: in a
  two-sector growth model with negative atmospheric externalities (like climate
  change), increased intergenerational altruism can undermine long-term
  well-being. Each dynasty's attempt to help future generations through
  increased altruism leads to behaviors that collectively worsen outcomes. This
  contrasts with standard one-sector models where sufficient altruism
  guarantees good outcomes. The result highlights the importance of collective
  action rather than individual altruism alone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals limits of individual altruism in addressing
  problems requiring collective action. For asset-based giving norms, it
  suggests that individual optimization of giving timing may be insufficient—
  what matters is the collective effect of individual strategies. The result
  cautions against inferring that more patient (future-oriented) individual
  giving necessarily improves long-term outcomes.

  year = {2007},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511817434},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The Stern Review famously argued for urgent climate action
  based on a near-zero pure rate of time preference and low elasticity of
  marginal utility. Stern's choice of a 0.1% pure time preference rate (to
  account only for extinction risk) led to much higher valuations of
  distant-future climate damages than alternative discount rate approaches. The
  review sparked intense debate about the appropriate discount rate for
  intergenerational cost-benefit analysis.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on climate policy, the Stern Review demonstrates the
  enormous practical stakes of time preference debates. The controversy over
  Stern's discount rate choice illustrates the tension between ethical
  arguments against discounting and economic modeling conventions. For
  philanthropic timing, it shows how different time preference assumptions lead
  to radically different conclusions about present versus future resource
  allocation.

  pages = {272--291},
  doi = {10.1080/1350178X.2017.1356057},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelleher examines the role of pure time preference in
  intertemporal welfare economics, analyzing debates between economists who
  accept positive time preference and philosophers who reject it. He argues
  that the disagreement partly reflects different methodological commitments:
  economists often treat time preference as a descriptive parameter of actual
  preferences, while philosophers treat it as a normative question about
  rational or ethical evaluation. Kelleher defends the economists' approach in
  certain contexts while acknowledging the force of philosophical objections.

  RELEVANCE: This paper helps clarify what is at stake in time preference
  debates for philanthropic timing decisions. It distinguishes between
  describing actual donor preferences (which may exhibit time preference) and
  prescribing what utilitarian obligations require (which may exclude pure time
  preference). For asset-based giving norms, this suggests the question is not
  just what donors prefer but what they ought to prefer from a utilitarian
  standpoint.

  qualified role for time preference in positive economics while acknowledging

  pages = {47--82},
  doi = {10.1093/aristotelian/84.1.47},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Parfit argues that bias toward the near—preferring benefits
  merely because they are temporally nearer—is rationally indefensible,
  analogous to preferring one's future Tuesday-self over one's future
  Wednesday-self. He distinguishes this from the rational preference for
  earlier over later painful experiences (due to relief) and argues that the
  former is a cognitive bias we should reject. This argument extends to the
  intergenerational case, suggesting that temporal location alone cannot
  justify differential concern.

  RELEVANCE: Parfit's argument against pure time preference provides the
  philosophical foundation for much of the anti-discounting position in
  philanthropy timing debates. If his argument succeeds, then giving now cannot
  be justified merely because present needs are temporally nearer—it must be
  defended on grounds of urgency, uncertainty, or strategic considerations. For
  asset-based norms, this supports evaluating investment strategies on
  consequentialist grounds rather than temporal proximity.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This blog post explains "hits-based giving," an approach
  borrowed from venture capital where donors make multiple high-risk,
  high-reward donations expecting most to fail but some to succeed dramatically.
  The post argues that this approach, advocated by Open Philanthropy, may be
  particularly appropriate for speculative causes or emerging issues where
  conventional charity evaluation is difficult. It discusses how to implement
  hits-based strategies through diversification and expected value reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: Hits-based giving represents an alternative to both immediate
  giving to proven interventions and patient philanthropy through investment.
  It suggests a third path: immediate deployment to high-variance opportunities.
  For asset-based giving norms, this raises the question of whether large asset
  holders should liquidate and deploy to hits-based portfolios rather than
  either holding assets or giving to proven charities. The approach emphasizes
  active grant-making rather than passive investment.

  POSITION: Effective altruism approach to high-risk, high-reward giving;
  emphasizes active deployment over patient investment.

  number = {1},
  pages = {89--112},
  doi = {10.1515/MOPP-2018-0060},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mintz-Woo defends utility discounting based on risk rather
  than pure time preference. He argues that when future utility faces
  model-independent risk (outcomes that won't materialize due to unpredictable
  events), rational discounting is justified. He distinguishes this "probability
  discounting" from pure time preference and responds to objections from Parfit
  and Broome. The resulting discount rates are typically lower than descriptive
  rates but positive.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a middle ground between zero discounting and
  conventional rates based on pure time preference. For philanthropic timing,
  it suggests that some discounting of future donations may be justified not
  because they occur later but because of genuine uncertainty about whether
  they will occur (donor death, value drift, societal disruption). This could
  favor give-now strategies without requiring pure time preference.

  POSITION: Defense of limited discounting based on risk rather than pure time
  preference; responds to anti-discounting arguments.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the strongest philosophical objections to utilitarian demands
for charitable giving, including the demandingness objection, critiques of effective
altruism, and non-utilitarian perspectives on beneficence. The demandingness objection,
articulated prominently by Scheffler, Murphy, and others, argues that utilitarianism
makes unreasonably high demands on moral agents. Murphy's "The Demands of Beneficence"
(1993) is foundational, proposing a cooperative principle that limits individual
obligations based on what others are doing. Cullity's "The Moral Demands of Affluence"
(2004) provides the most comprehensive treatment, arguing against simple cost-based
limits while defending a more nuanced account. Hooker's demandingness objection
distinguishes different dimensions of demandingness and their relevance to moral
theory. Recent work extends these objections to effective altruism specifically,
with Gabriel's "Effective Altruism and its Critics" (2017) cataloging objections
from justice, special obligations, and systemic change perspectives. The institutional
critique, developed by Berkey and Dietz, argues EA neglects structural reforms.
Alternative frameworks include Pearlman's mutual aid model and virtue ethics
approaches to charitable giving.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for balanced analysis of income vs. asset-based giving norms.
If demandingness objections apply to income-based norms, they apply with equal or
greater force to asset-based norms (which are more demanding). If critics are correct
that the status quo reflects appropriate limits on beneficence, this undermines
both proposals. Understanding these objections helps identify which features of giving
norms generate demandingness concerns: is it the overall sacrifice required, the
encroachment on personal projects, or something else? This analysis is crucial for
determining whether asset-based norms would face distinctive objections beyond those
facing income-based norms.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers directly address the income vs. asset distinction in demandingness
discussions. Most critiques focus on overall sacrifice levels rather than the form
wealth takes. Limited discussion of how liquidity and fungibility affect moral
demandingness. Virtue ethics and deontological alternatives to utilitarian giving
are underdeveloped compared to the demandingness literature itself.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare how demandingness objections apply to income-based vs. asset-based norms.
Consider whether asset illiquidity provides independent moral relevance or merely
affects perceived sacrifice. Examine whether critics' concerns about personal
projects and integrity apply differently to wealth stocks vs. flows. Note tensions
between institutional critiques of EA (favoring systemic change) and arguments for
limited individual obligations.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Demandingness as limiting principle (Murphy, Cullity, Hooker): 7 papers
- Effective altruism critiques (Gabriel, Berkey, Syme, Ioannidis): 5 papers
- Alternative frameworks (Pearlman, mutual aid, virtue ethics): 3 papers

@article{murphy1993demands,

  volume = {22},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy argues against Singer's demanding principle of beneficence by proposing a cooperative alternative: individuals are only required to contribute their fair share toward optimal outcomes, not to compensate for others' failures to contribute. He defends a collective principle of beneficence that limits individual obligations when others do not comply, rejecting both the demanding consequentialist view and the minimalist view that limits obligations based on personal cost alone.

  RELEVANCE: This is foundational for understanding objections to demanding giving norms. Murphy's cooperative principle would apply equally to both income-based and asset-based norms, potentially limiting both. His framework suggests that the demandingness problem is not primarily about what form wealth takes (income vs. assets) but about the overall level of sacrifice and fairness considerations when compliance is non-ideal. This challenges any proposal that asset-based norms should be more demanding simply because assets represent accumulated wealth.

  POSITION: Limits beneficence through cooperative fairness rather than personal cost. Represents the most influential non-utilitarian constraint on demanding giving obligations.

  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity provides the most comprehensive defense against the demandingness objection. He rejects simple cost-based limits on beneficence but defends moderate limits by showing how reasonable beneficence can be demanding without being unreasonably demanding. He argues that the life-compromising test (whether fulfilling all moral requirements would prevent living a worthwhile life) provides a principled limit on beneficence demands, while rejecting Murphy's cooperative principle and cost-based approaches as insufficiently grounded.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for evaluating whether asset-based norms would be unreasonably demanding. Cullity's framework suggests that demandingness depends not just on total sacrifice but on whether obligations prevent living a worthwhile life. This implies that asset-based norms might be more problematic than income-based norms if they threaten long-term security and life plans in ways that annual income sacrifices do not. His rejection of cost-based limits also suggests that mere inconvenience or illiquidity of assets provides insufficient grounds for exempting them from beneficence demands.

  POSITION: Moderate limits on beneficence justified by life-compromising concerns, not simple costs. The most thorough contemporary treatment of demandingness in affluence contexts.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arneson critically examines various proposals for limiting beneficence demands, including Murphy's cooperative principle and cost-based limits. He argues that many proposed limits lack principled justification and that we may need to accept more demanding obligations than common sense morality suggests. He distinguishes between limits based on personal prerogatives versus limits based on fairness or coordination problems.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical perspective on whether proposed limits to beneficence (including those based on asset illiquidity or personal project protection) are genuinely principled or merely rationalizations of self-interest. His analysis suggests that arguments for exempting assets from giving norms must be scrutinized carefully - asset illiquidity may not provide a principled limit any more than other forms of personal cost do. This challenges proposals that treat income and assets asymmetrically without strong justification.

  POSITION: Skeptical of proposed limits on beneficence; demands rigorous justification for constraints on utilitarian demands.

  year = {2009},
  pages = {148--162},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker distinguishes between different dimensions of demandingness - time demands, attention demands, decision-making costs, and sacrifice of personal goals. He argues that impartial act-consequentialism's requirement of beneficence toward strangers is objectionably demanding primarily in how it threatens personal projects and integrity, not merely in aggregate sacrifice. He defends rule-consequentialism as avoiding excessive demandingness while maintaining impartial concern.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how income vs. asset norms differ in their demandingness. Hooker's dimensional analysis suggests that asset-based norms might be demanding in distinctive ways - not just in quantity of sacrifice but in threatening long-term security, disrupting established plans, and requiring constant recalculation of net worth. Income-based norms may be less demanding along these dimensions even if equivalent in aggregate sacrifice, because income flows are more predictable and less tied to identity and life plans than accumulated assets.

  POSITION: Demandingness objection succeeds against act-consequentialism but rule-consequentialism provides an adequate response.

  number = {4},
  pages = {457--473},
  doi = {10.1111/JAPP.12176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically categorizes objections to effective altruism, identifying three main strands: (1) justice-based critiques arguing EA neglects structural inequality and rights, (2) special obligations critiques arguing EA's impartialism ignores legitimate partiality to family and community, and (3) epistemic critiques about EA's confidence in quantitative assessments. He argues that while EA can accommodate many concerns, there are genuine tensions with justice frameworks that prioritize equality and urgency over aggregate welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Provides framework for anticipating objections to both income-based and asset-based utilitarian giving norms. The justice critique applies equally to both, but the special obligations critique might apply differently - family obligations may include maintaining assets for inheritance or intergenerational transfer, potentially exempting some assets from immediate giving demands. The epistemic critique also applies to asset valuations, which are often less precise than income measurements. This suggests asset-based norms face additional implementation challenges beyond those facing income-based norms.

  POSITION: EA can partially accommodate critics' concerns but faces genuine tensions with non-welfarist moral frameworks, especially regarding distributive justice.

  number = {2},
  pages = {143--171},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey examines the institutional critique that EA focuses excessively on individual charitable giving while neglecting systemic institutional change. He argues this critique is often misunderstood - properly understood, EA's core commitments (doing the most good one can) are compatible with pursuing institutional reform. However, the EA movement in practice has tended to favor individual-level interventions, partly due to measurability concerns and partly due to implicit assumptions about the limits of individual political efficacy.

  RELEVANCE: The institutional critique applies to the entire project of focusing on individual giving norms (whether income-based or asset-based). If critics are correct that individual charity is less effective than political advocacy for structural change, then debates about income vs. asset norms may be addressing the wrong question. However, Berkey's analysis suggests the critique targets EA's practical focus rather than its core principles, so refined giving norms could still be valuable even if supplemented by institutional advocacy. Asset-based norms might be especially susceptible to this critique if they focus attention on individual wealth management rather than systemic inequality.

  POSITION: Institutional critique points to genuine limitations in EA practice but does not refute EA's core principles; EA should incorporate more attention to systemic change.

  number = {1},
  pages = {106--115},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820818000158},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz argues that EA relies on an overly individualistic approach to ethics that neglects collective obligations and coordination problems. Drawing on act-utilitarianism's well-known problems with collective action, he contends that focusing on what each individual can do leads to suboptimal outcomes when collective action would be more effective. He defends a version of the institutional critique grounded in collective obligation theory rather than empirical claims about institutional effectiveness.

  RELEVANCE: This critique applies to individual-level giving norms generally, whether income-based or asset-based. However, it might apply with special force to asset-based norms, which require more complex coordination and information-sharing than income-based norms. For example, determining appropriate asset sacrifice levels requires knowledge of what others with similar asset positions are doing, creating coordination challenges. Income-based norms, being more standardized and easier to implement through existing tax-like mechanisms, may face fewer collective action problems.

  POSITION: EA's individualistic focus neglects collective obligations and institutional coordination; effective altruists should prioritize collective action over individual optimization.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMahan surveys major philosophical objections to EA, including concerns about demandingness, neglect of special obligations, insensitivity to agent-relative reasons, and problems with measuring and comparing welfare across different contexts. He notes that while EA has utilitarian roots, many of its practical recommendations could be endorsed from other moral frameworks, though tensions remain particularly around questions of partiality and the scope of moral obligation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides overview of how multiple philosophical frameworks (deontology, virtue ethics, care ethics) would evaluate utilitarian giving demands. These alternative frameworks might evaluate income vs. asset norms differently - for instance, virtue ethics might see preserving family assets as expressing appropriate family loyalty, while deontology might recognize stronger property rights over accumulated wealth than over future income. Understanding these alternative frameworks helps identify which objections apply specifically to asset-based proposals versus utilitarian giving demands generally.

  POSITION: EA faces serious objections from non-utilitarian moral theories, particularly regarding demandingness, partiality, and agent-relative reasons, though some practical convergence is possible.

  number = {1},
  pages = {93--120},
  doi = {10.1007/S10677-019-09979-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Syme examines the systemic change objection to EA - that individual charity is ineffective compared to revolutionary structural change addressing root causes of poverty and suffering. He argues that EA's emphasis on measurable impact and marginal effectiveness biases it toward status quo interventions, missing potentially high-impact systemic changes. However, he contends that this is a contingent feature of EA practice rather than a necessary implication of its core principles, and that EA could incorporate systemic change interventions if they prove more effective.

  RELEVANCE: This critique challenges the entire framing of individual giving obligations (whether based on income or assets). If systemic change is vastly more effective, debates about optimal individual giving norms may be misguided. However, the critique might apply differently to asset-based norms: large accumulated assets could potentially fund systemic change efforts (advocacy organizations, political campaigns, movement-building) more effectively than annual income flows. This suggests that if asset-based norms were adopted, they might direct giving toward systemic change rather than direct service provision.

  POSITION: EA's methodological biases toward measurable short-term interventions cause it to undervalue systemic change, though this is correctable within EA's framework.

  journal = {Conatus},

  doi = {10.12681/CJP.22296},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ioannidis offers a radical critique of EA's philosophical foundations, arguing that EA is not authentic altruism because it is founded on the sacrifice and objectification of the other (the aid recipient). Drawing on Levinasian ethics, he contends that EA's utilitarian calculus treats beneficiaries as means to the donor's goal of maximizing good, rather than as ends in themselves with dignity and agency. This critique extends to EA's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and measurable outcomes, which he sees as dehumanizing.

  RELEVANCE: This philosophical critique applies to utilitarian giving norms generally, whether income-based or asset-based, because both frameworks treat beneficiaries as locations for utility improvement rather than autonomous agents. However, the critique might have distinctive application to asset-based norms: accumulated wealth often has personal and family significance that income flows lack, so asset-based giving might involve even more instrumentalization of others' needs to justify sacrificing personally meaningful property. This suggests that non-utilitarian frameworks might favor preserving assets over income for agent-centered rather than consequentialist reasons.

  POSITION: EA's utilitarian foundations are ethically problematic because they objectify beneficiaries and reduce ethics to calculation; authentic altruism requires recognition of the other's infinite worth.

  journal = {Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {33},
  number = {2},
  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman argues against Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism (OOEA) and its demand to give to the most effective causes rather than to people or causes we care about. She defends Mutual Aid as a morally superior alternative that embraces partiality, builds community, and respects local knowledge. Mutual Aid networks involve reciprocal support among community members, usually geographically proximate, sharing material goods and social support based on solidarity rather than cost-effectiveness calculations.

  RELEVANCE: This critique challenges the impartialism underlying both income-based and asset-based utilitarian giving norms. However, it might apply differently to assets versus income: mutual aid frameworks often involve sharing assets (housing, tools, equipment) more than redistributing income, suggesting assets have distinctive roles in solidarity-based giving. The mutual aid model also emphasizes reciprocity and relationship, which may be easier to sustain with asset-sharing than with income redistribution. This suggests that asset-based norms might need to incorporate relational and reciprocal dimensions that income-based norms do not.

  POSITION: Rejecting OOEA's impartial demandingness in favor of partial, community-based mutual aid as a legitimate way to discharge duties to help others.

  journal = {Revue internationale de philosophie},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {66},
  number = {4},
  pages = {427--438},
  doi = {10.3917/rip.266.0427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lazari-Radek and Singer respond to the demandingness objection by acknowledging that utilitarianism does demand more than common sense morality but arguing that conditions have changed since Sidgwick's time, widening this gap. They contend that common sense morality needs to change to reflect modern conditions (global inequality, effectiveness of aid, our knowledge of suffering), not that utilitarianism should be rejected. They defend the view that those in affluent societies should give much more than currently regarded as obligatory.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether utilitarian demands (including potential asset-based demands) should be rejected as too demanding or whether common sense morality should be revised upward. Their argument that changed conditions justify greater demands could support asset-based norms: the massive wealth inequality that has emerged in recent decades, with some individuals holding billions while others starve, might constitute a changed condition justifying demands on accumulated wealth that would have been inappropriate in earlier eras. This provides utilitarian grounds for reconsidering asset exemptions.

  POSITION: Defends utilitarian demandingness against the objection; argues that common sense morality should become more demanding to match utilitarian requirements.

  pages = {253--274},
  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190905323.013.13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sobel argues that for the demandingness objection to succeed against consequentialism, it must explain which costs are deemed especially demanding and why morality should prioritize avoiding those costs. He shows that the objection cannot function as persuasive critique without prioritizing some costs (e.g., threats to personal projects, integrity) over others (e.g., material sacrifice, inconvenience). He considers and rejects various ways of making this prioritization, ultimately expressing skepticism about the objection's success.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for evaluating whether asset illiquidity or attachment constitutes a relevant kind of cost that makes asset-based norms especially demanding. Sobel's analysis suggests that simply noting that asset liquidation is inconvenient or psychologically costly is insufficient - we need an account of why these particular costs should limit moral demands. This challenges proposals to exempt assets based merely on illiquidity or personal attachment without showing why these features matter morally rather than just prudentially. His framework demands more sophisticated justification for treating income and assets differently.

  POSITION: Skeptical that the demandingness objection can meet the challenge of explaining why certain costs should constrain morality without begging the question against consequentialism.

  pages = {225--242},
  doi = {10.1111/J.1467-9213.2009.609.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hills examines whether contractualism (Scanlon's version) can provide principled limits on demandingness that utilitarianism lacks. She argues that contractualism's appeal to what could not be reasonably rejected does not straightforwardly generate less demanding requirements than utilitarianism. In many cases, contractualist reasoning supports similarly demanding obligations because refusing to help those in dire need when one could do so at moderate cost would be reasonably rejectable. She concludes that contractualism may not escape demandingness concerns as decisively as sometimes thought.

  RELEVANCE: Examines whether non-utilitarian frameworks (contractualism) provide resources for limiting giving demands in ways that would support income-based over asset-based norms. Hills' analysis suggests that contractualism might support similarly demanding obligations regardless of wealth form, because those in dire need could reasonably reject principles that exempt accumulated wealth from helping obligations. This implies that attempts to justify income/asset asymmetry by appealing to contractualist reasonable rejection may fail - those dying of preventable diseases could reasonably reject principles that protect donors' wealth accumulation.

  POSITION: Contractualism does not provide clear escape from demandingness concerns; reasonable rejection framework may support demanding obligations similar to utilitarianism.

  journal = {Journal of Social Philosophy},

  volume = {44},
  number = {2},
  pages = {169--191},
  doi = {10.1111/JOSP.12018},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Braddock defends utilitarian demands against the demandingness objection by arguing that the intuitions supporting the objection are unreliable. He draws on empirical psychology showing that moral intuitions are subject to various biases and distortions, including self-serving bias, status quo bias, and psychological distance effects. He argues that our intuitions about how demanding morality should be are particularly suspect because we have strong motivations to avoid demanding moral requirements, making these intuitions more likely products of rationalization than genuine moral insight.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges reliance on intuitions that income-based norms are appropriately limited or that assets should be exempt from giving demands. Braddock's argument suggests that intuitions favoring less demanding norms (whether by limiting income obligations or exempting assets entirely) may reflect self-serving bias rather than principled moral reasoning. This supports revisiting both income-based and asset-based norms without deferring to status quo intuitions. However, it provides no guidance on whether asset-based or income-based norms are superior, only that both should be evaluated by reasons rather than intuitions.

  POSITION: Defends utilitarian demandingness by debunking the intuitions underlying demandingness objections as products of bias rather than reliable moral insight.
