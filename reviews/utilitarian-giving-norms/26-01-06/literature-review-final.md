## Introduction

Utilitarian moral theory generates demanding obligations to aid those in need. Peter Singer's (1972) foundational argument establishes that if we can prevent suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. When applied to global poverty, this principle implies that affluent individuals should give substantially—perhaps until the point where further giving would cause comparable harm to themselves. Shelly Kagan (1989) defends an uncompromising version of this view, rejecting agent-centered prerogatives that would limit beneficence requirements. The result is a theoretical framework that appears to demand significant sacrifice from those with resources to spare.

Contemporary philanthropic movements have sought to operationalize these obligations through practical giving norms. The effective altruism movement, articulated most prominently by William MacAskill (2015), combines utilitarian concern for maximizing impact with evidence-based evaluation of charitable interventions. Central to this movement is the Giving What We Can pledge—a commitment to donate at least ten percent of one's income to effective charities. This income-based standard has become the flagship operationalization of utilitarian giving obligations, adopted by thousands of individuals seeking to act on their moral commitments (Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom 2023).

Yet the dominance of income-based giving norms lacks explicit philosophical defense. Liam Murphy's (1993) cooperative principle, which limits individual obligations to a fair share of what would be required under full compliance, could in principle be applied to either income or accumulated assets. The demandingness literature more broadly (Cullity 2004; Scheffler 1982) constrains the extent of sacrifice morality may require, but remains silent on whether that sacrifice should be calculated from income flows or asset stocks. The ten percent income standard appears to have emerged from pragmatic considerations—predictability, psychological accessibility, ease of implementation—rather than principled utilitarian reasoning about which metric best captures an individual's capacity to give without comparable sacrifice.

This silence is philosophically significant. Empirical research on the marginal utility of money suggests that additional resources provide diminishing welfare benefits (Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell 2008). However, income and wealth may have systematically different marginal utility profiles. Assets beyond reasonable security thresholds serve primarily positional functions—signaling relative status rather than enabling additional consumption—while income continues to fund ongoing welfare. If this asymmetry holds, then asset-based giving norms might generate greater aggregate welfare improvements than income-based alternatives for a given level of donor sacrifice.

Eamon Aloyo (2023) has recently proposed progressive wealth-based giving as a fairer alternative to income-based tithing, arguing that accumulated wealth better captures historical advantages and net financial position. Yet his argument emphasizes fairness rather than utilitarian optimization, leaving open the central question this review addresses: given that marginal utility theory applies differently to income flows versus asset stocks, should utilitarian giving norms be reformulated around assets?

This review examines the theoretical foundations and practical implications of this question. It proceeds by analyzing utilitarian giving obligations and their limits, developing the case for income-asset asymmetry in marginal utility, identifying gaps in the existing literature, and considering what a principled asset-sensitive approach to philanthropic norms might require. The aim is not to reject income-based giving, but to interrogate an unexamined default and assess whether asset-based alternatives merit serious philosophical attention.


## Utilitarian Giving Obligations and Their Limits

The utilitarian case for substantial charitable giving begins with a deceptively simple observation: the marginal utility of money declines as wealth increases. A dollar transferred from an affluent individual to someone living in extreme poverty produces far greater welfare gains for the recipient than welfare losses for the donor. Peter Singer's (1972) foundational argument draws out this implication with characteristic directness: if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Applied to global poverty, this principle seems to require giving until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to others---potentially until one approaches the living standard of those being aided.

This demanding conclusion has provoked decades of philosophical response, generating both defenses of strong beneficence obligations and principled frameworks for limiting them. Yet a striking feature of this literature has gone largely unremarked: these foundational arguments are framed almost exclusively in terms of income sacrifice---what one "can afford" to give from ongoing resources---rather than accumulated wealth. The demandingness debate constrains overall sacrifice but remains silent on whether income or assets should serve as the sacrifice base. This section examines utilitarian foundations for giving obligations, the major limiting principles that have emerged, and how contemporary practice has operationalized these theoretical commitments through income-based norms whose justification, we shall see, remains underexamined.

### Foundational Arguments for Utilitarian Giving

Singer's 1972 argument established the template for utilitarian approaches to charitable obligation. The argument proceeds from an uncontroversial premise about preventing bad things to a radical conclusion about our duties to distant strangers. Distance and the number of potential helpers are, Singer argues, morally irrelevant: that others could help but do not does not diminish our obligation. The demanding implication follows from utilitarian logic itself: we should give until marginal costs equal marginal benefits, which for the affluent means giving far more than conventional charity expects.

Shelly Kagan (1989) defends an uncompromising version of this view, arguing that common-sense limits on beneficence obligations lack adequate justification. What appears demanding from the personal point of view carries no independent moral weight against impartial considerations. Kagan represents the "bite the bullet" response to demandingness: if utilitarian principles generate extensive obligations, so much the worse for our comfortable assumptions about the limits of duty. Peter Unger (1996) reinforces this demanding position by revealing how psychological factors distort our moral judgments---the salience of the drowning child versus the statistical life saved by donation reflects morally irrelevant features of how cases present themselves.

More recently, effective altruism has channeled these utilitarian insights into practical guidance. William MacAskill (2015, 2019) articulates the movement's core commitment: using evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others as much as possible, then acting on that basis. While MacAskill distinguishes effective altruism from strict utilitarianism, the movement inherits the utilitarian focus on consequences and welfare maximization. Crucially for our purposes, MacAskill's practical guidance centers on income-based metrics---earning to give, the 10% income pledge---without explicit defense of income over wealth as the relevant sacrifice base.

### The Demandingness Problem and Limiting Principles

The demandingness objection cuts to the heart of utilitarian beneficence: if morality really requires giving to marginal utility equality, it demands too much. Various philosophers have developed principled responses that preserve meaningful obligations while avoiding extreme demands.

Liam Murphy's (1993, 2000) "cooperative principle" offers perhaps the most influential limiting framework. On Murphy's view, agents are required only to contribute their fair share toward achieving the best outcome, calculated on the assumption that others will also contribute their fair shares. Under full compliance, each individual's fair share would be modest; the apparent extremity of beneficence obligations arises from non-compliance by others. Murphy's principle provides resources for percentage-based norms: if fair shares can be calculated as percentages, then a 10% pledge represents not an arbitrary stopping point but a principled distribution of collective responsibility. Yet Murphy's framework does not specify whether fair shares should be calculated from income flows or wealth stocks---either could, in principle, serve as the base.

Samuel Scheffler (1982) introduces "agent-centered prerogatives" that permit individuals to give disproportionate weight to their own projects and commitments. The personal point of view has independent normative significance: agents may permissibly favor their own interests by some proportional amount relative to the impersonal good. This structure limits moral demands while preserving consequentialist foundations. However, Scheffler does not specify the size of the prerogative, leaving the quantitative threshold arbitrary. His framework better justifies qualitative limits---that some giving is required but not all---than precise percentages.

Garrett Cullity (2004) develops a distinct "life-shaping" constraint on beneficence. The problem with demanding principles, Cullity argues, is not merely their cost but their iterative structure: each act of beneficence creates circumstances calling for further beneficence, generating a regress that undermines autonomous life-projects. The solution lies in preserving agents' capacity for autonomous agency---beneficence must not expand to consume one's ability to shape one's own life. This constraint could ground percentage-based norms by defining the threshold at which giving begins to undermine life-projects, but notably, such thresholds would vary with individual circumstances, potentially favoring context-sensitive asset-based norms over uniform income-based ones.

Brian McElwee (2017) usefully distinguishes "cost-based" demandingness objections (morality requires too much sacrifice) from "directive force" objections (morality issues too many requirements). Even if a 10% income pledge is not too costly for affluent agents, the continuous obligation to give may create excessive directive force---morality governing too much of life. McElwee's analysis suggests that complete giving norms require both quantitative thresholds (how much) and qualitative limits (when obligation applies).

Rule consequentialism provides yet another route to moderate demands. Brad Hooker (2000) argues that the right acts are those required by the learnable set of rules whose internalization by the overwhelming majority would have the best consequences. The optimific code will include limited beneficence requirements because unlimited requirements would be unlearnable and would undermine agent motivation. Hooker's "learnability" and "internalizability" constraints suggest that simple percentage-based rules may be more likely part of the optimific code than complex formulas---a consideration potentially favoring income-based norms for their psychological accessibility.

### Contemporary Practice and the 10% Default

The effective altruism movement has operationalized utilitarian giving obligations through the Giving What We Can pledge: a commitment to donate at least 10% of income to effective charities. This norm has achieved remarkable success in mobilizing sustained giving, with empirical research revealing distinctive psychological profiles among pledge-takers. Matti Wilks and colleagues (2023) find that pledge-takers score higher on moral expansiveness, actively open-minded thinking, and utilitarian subscales compared to matched controls, suggesting the norm attracts those predisposed to impartial moral concern.

Brian Berkey (2021) identifies effective altruism's philosophical core as requiring individuals to make significant contributions to benefiting others in ways that are optimific (or close to it) on empirically grounded assessments. The emphasis on practical action alongside theory suggests that EA should be receptive to empirical arguments about giving metrics. Yet the movement has not seriously examined whether income-based norms best serve its own stated goals.

Theron Pummer (2016) develops a conditional approach that sidesteps demandingness objections: even if we lack unconditional obligations to give, we may have strong conditional obligations to give effectively when we do give. This framework shifts the question from "how much to give" to "given that we give, how to give most effectively." But the conditional approach leaves open which metric---income or assets---should govern the "how much" question for those who do accept giving obligations.

Eamon Aloyo (2023) provides the only sustained argument within EA discourse for wealth-based rather than income-based giving norms. He critiques the tithing proposal on grounds of demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustice, arguing that progressive wealth-based giving better captures concerns about inherited versus earned resources. Yet Aloyo's argument proceeds primarily from fairness considerations rather than utilitarian optimization, leaving open whether wealth-based norms would actually maximize welfare gains from giving.

The dominance of income-based norms in effective altruism appears to reflect pragmatic convenience rather than principled justification. Income is regular and predictable, easily integrated into budgeting and automatic transfers. The 10% standard echoes religious tithing traditions, lending psychological familiarity. These practical virtues may justify income-based norms on rule-consequentialist grounds if they promote sustainable giving behavior. However, they do not establish that income represents the theoretically optimal sacrifice base for utilitarian purposes.

What emerges from this survey is a substantial gap: utilitarian theory generates strong prima facie obligations to give, various limiting principles provide theoretical resources for moderate giving norms, and contemporary practice has settled on income-based percentages as the operative standard. But none of this literature directly examines whether income or assets should serve as the metric against which sacrifice is measured. The demandingness debate constrains how much we must give, but the choice of sacrifice base---whether we measure from flows or stocks---remains an unexamined assumption. If income and assets have systematically different marginal utility profiles, this assumption may not be normatively neutral.


## The Case for Income-Asset Asymmetry

The utilitarian case for giving obligations rests on the diminishing marginal utility of money: each additional dollar provides less welfare to those who already have more. Yet this foundational principle has been applied almost exclusively to income flows rather than wealth stocks, despite the significant conceptual and empirical differences between them. This section develops the central theoretical argument that income and assets have systematically different marginal utility profiles, providing potential grounds for asset-sensitive giving norms.

### Marginal Utility of Income and Consumption

The empirical literature on marginal utility has established robust estimates of the elasticity of marginal utility of income, the parameter governing how quickly utility gains decline as income rises. Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell (2008), using life satisfaction data across and within countries, estimate an elasticity of approximately 1.26, implying that the relationship between income and utility is roughly logarithmic. This means a one percent increase in income generates roughly equal utility gains regardless of baseline income level—a finding with profound implications for redistribution. Evans (2005) arrives at similar conclusions using consumption data for OECD countries, finding elasticities ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 with most estimates between 1.0 and 1.5. The most recent comprehensive synthesis, by Acland and Greenberg (2023), recommends an elasticity of 1.6 (with sensitivity bounds of 1.2-2.0) for policy applications, reflecting methodological consensus across decades of empirical work.

However, a critical limitation pervades this literature: the conflation of income flows with wealth stocks. Studies estimate "marginal utility of income" without disaggregating how the utility functions might differ between a dollar received as current income versus a dollar held as accumulated wealth. Gandelman and Hernandez-Murillo (2015), estimating risk aversion using happiness data across 75 countries, find remarkable consistency in parameters—but again treat all monetary resources equivalently. The project's central hypothesis—that income and wealth have distinct marginal utility profiles—cannot be directly tested using existing estimates, because the foundational measurement work does not distinguish between these categories.

### The Distinctive Functions of Wealth

Wealth serves functions that income alone cannot fulfill, and these distinctive functions create threshold effects in marginal utility that the income-consumption literature misses. The most important is the precautionary savings motive: accumulated assets provide insurance against future income shocks. Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy (2013) demonstrate that even individuals who are risk-loving (with convex utility in wealth) exhibit prudence—they accumulate precautionary savings against uncertainty. This finding establishes that wealth accumulation for insurance purposes is a robust behavioral pattern across different utility specifications, not merely a feature of risk aversion.

The empirical evidence on household finance confirms that wealth levels dramatically affect consumption responses to income changes. Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar (2020) show enormous heterogeneity in marginal propensity to consume: low-wealth households spend most of windfall gains while high-wealth households smooth consumption effectively. This asymmetry reveals that wealth's marginal utility is much higher for low-wealth households—where precautionary needs remain unmet—than for high-wealth households who possess adequate buffers. A threshold effect emerges: once sufficient insurance has been accumulated, additional wealth provides diminishing utility because the precautionary motive is satiated.

Beyond insurance, wealth serves as a positional good whose value depends partly on relative standing. Ghosh and Wendner (2018) analyze economies where households care about both absolute and relative wealth, demonstrating that positional preferences lead to over-accumulation of capital relative to social optima. Individuals fail to internalize the negative externality of reducing others' relative position through their own accumulation. This creates a wedge between private and social marginal utility: from society's perspective, the marginal utility of additional wealth declines more steeply than individuals perceive, because much of the perceived value is zero-sum status competition. Freiman (2014) argues that prioritarians should account for positional characteristics because they affect absolute wellbeing, not merely relative standing—when goods are partially positional, scarcity creates genuine welfare differences that utilitarian and prioritarian frameworks alike must address.

The synthesis of these literatures suggests a hypothesis that existing marginal utility estimates fail to capture: wealth beyond reasonable security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than equivalent income. Income enables consumption and maintains living standards; wealth beyond insurance needs primarily serves positional competition where gains to one are largely offset by losses to others.

### Wealth Ethics and Non-Utilitarian Considerations

Independent of utilitarian marginal utility calculations, the philosophical literature on wealth ethics provides additional reasons for treating assets differently from income. Halliday (2018) argues that inheritance is unjust to the extent that it perpetuates intergenerational inequality, concentrating advantage across generations and undermining fair equality of opportunity. While income inequality affects contemporaries, wealth transmission compounds inequality over time. This temporal dimension distinguishes assets from income flows in normatively significant ways: present wealth holdings represent not merely current capacity but future intergenerational transfers.

Robeyns (2017) develops limitarianism—the view that there should be upper bounds on permissible wealth holdings. She grounds this position in multiple considerations: extreme wealth could meet urgent unmet needs elsewhere, undermines political equality, and reflects objectionable political processes. Crucially, limitarianism targets wealth stocks rather than income flows, representing a clear case where assets are thought to generate obligations distinct from those arising from ongoing income. Volacu (2022) refines the democratic argument for limitarianism, focusing on how excessive wealth threatens democratic resilience beyond its effects on formal political equality—concentrated wealth corrodes democratic institutions through channels that income inequality alone cannot.

Wilson (2021) identifies a tension in "philanthrocapitalism"—massive giving by the ultra-wealthy—that illuminates the distinctive ethical character of extreme asset holdings. Such philanthropy is only possible under conditions of extreme wealth inequality that may itself be unjust; the very capacity for mega-giving depends on a prior distribution that egalitarians would challenge. This does not necessarily condemn large-scale giving, but it suggests that asset-based norms must engage with wealth ethics, not merely utilitarian optimization. Arneson (2002), arguing from a luck egalitarian framework, contends that justice requires transfers to offset both income and wealth inequalities because both affect what individuals can achieve. Yet his framework does not fully develop whether the temporal structures of flow versus stock generate different obligations—leaving conceptual space for the project's inquiry.

### The Temporal Dimension and Deferred Giving

Asset-based giving norms intersect with questions of philanthropic timing in ways that income-based norms largely avoid. When obligations attach to accumulated wealth, the question arises whether that wealth should be donated immediately or invested for potentially larger future donations. Broome (1994) establishes the anti-discounting position foundational to this debate: discounting future benefits merely because they occur in the future—pure time preference—is ethically arbitrary. Legitimate discounting for uncertainty or diminishing marginal utility is distinct from pure time preference. If this view is correct, deferred giving cannot be justified by temporal location alone.

MacAskill (2023) provides the most systematic framework for give-now-versus-later decisions within effective altruism. He identifies four key parameters: expected investment returns, the rate of diminishing returns to funding for specific causes, correlation between investment returns and cause importance, and existential risk. For causes with rapidly diminishing returns to funding, giving now is likely optimal; for emerging or speculative causes, patient philanthropy may be justified. This framework reveals that optimal timing depends on empirical parameters rather than pure time preference—and these parameters may interact differently with asset-based versus income-based norms.

Cordelli and Reich (2016) examine the intergenerational justice implications of deferred giving through endowments. They argue that such structures raise questions about whether current donors may permissibly prioritize future over present beneficiaries, and whether elite control of intergenerational resource allocation is democratically legitimate. Harris (2021) offers a more favorable view of patient philanthropy, developing a model where investors with high urgency allocate to immediate giving while more patient investors hold "mission-correlated assets"—investments whose returns correlate with favorable developments in their impact opportunity set. This suggests that the choice between immediate and deferred giving is not binary: strategic asset management may outperform both immediate liquidation and pure wealth maximization.

Mogensen (2019) explores whether agent-relative partiality could justify positive intergenerational time preference—giving greater weight to nearer generations. While skeptical that this argument succeeds, he treats it as the strongest case for time preference in philanthropic contexts. The interaction between asset-based norms and temporal strategies remains underexplored: if assets trigger obligations but those obligations may be fulfilled through investment rather than immediate donation, then asset-based norms may not differ as sharply from income-based norms in their practical implications as their theoretical foundations suggest.

The emerging synthesis points toward a research gap: if wealth's marginal utility declines more steeply than income's above security thresholds—due to satiation of precautionary motives and the positional character of excess wealth—then asset-based norms may generate greater welfare improvements per unit of subjective sacrifice than income-based norms. Non-utilitarian considerations from wealth ethics reinforce this asymmetry by identifying features of asset holdings (intergenerational transmission, political power, positional externalities) that lack analogues in income flows. Yet no existing work directly tests whether asset-based norms would outperform income-based norms under expected-utility assumptions, nor specifies the thresholds at which the argument for asset-based obligations becomes compelling.


## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals five significant gaps in the existing literature that the current research project addresses. These gaps collectively demonstrate that the dominance of income-based giving norms in utilitarian philanthropy represents an unexamined default rather than a principled choice.

### Gap 1: No Systematic Income-Asset Comparison in Utilitarian Giving Theory

Despite decades of sophisticated debate about the demandingness of utilitarian giving obligations, the literature has not systematically compared income-based and asset-based formulations. Singer's foundational argument (1972) discusses sacrifice in terms of what one "can afford" from ongoing resources, and this income-centric framing persists through effective altruism's operationalization in the Giving What We Can pledge, which commits members to donating at least 10% of income (MacAskill 2015). The demandingness literature similarly debates limits on sacrifice without specifying whether those limits should apply to income flows or wealth stocks: Murphy's cooperative principle (1993) could calculate fair shares from either base, and Cullity's life-shaping constraint (2004) addresses overall sacrifice levels without distinguishing the form wealth takes.

The sole exception is Aloyo (2023), who proposes progressive giving based on wealth rather than income. However, Aloyo's argument centers on fairness considerations—that wealth better captures historical advantages and net financial position—rather than on utilitarian optimization. No existing work directly asks which base would maximize welfare gains from giving under expected-utility assumptions. This gap matters because if income and assets have different marginal utility profiles, income-based norms may fail to maximize aggregate welfare improvement, making the choice of metric normatively significant rather than merely practical.

### Gap 2: Marginal Utility Literature Does Not Disaggregate Income from Wealth

Empirical research on diminishing marginal utility of money provides crucial foundations for utilitarian giving arguments, yet meta-analyses consistently estimate the "marginal utility of income" without distinguishing flows from stocks. Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell (2008) estimate an elasticity of approximately 1.26 using life satisfaction data, while Acland and Greenberg (2023) synthesize decades of studies to recommend 1.6 for policy applications—but both treat income and wealth interchangeably. The precautionary savings literature demonstrates that wealth serves distinct insurance functions (Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy 2013; Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar 2020), and the positional goods literature shows that wealth beyond security thresholds primarily affects relative status rather than absolute welfare (Ghosh and Wendner 2018; Freiman 2014). These strands suggest that wealth may exhibit steeper marginal utility decline than income once precautionary motives are satiated, but no study directly compares them.

This gap matters for the research project's central hypothesis: if assets beyond reasonable security thresholds have systematically lower marginal utility than equivalent income, then asset-based norms would generate greater welfare improvements per unit of donor sacrifice. The project addresses this by developing expected-utility models that incorporate the distinct functions of income (consumption) and wealth (insurance, optionality, status), deriving testable predictions about their differential utility profiles.

### Gap 3: Threshold Specification for Asset-Based Norms

Even those who accept that extreme wealth concentration is problematic have not specified at what level asset-based obligations should apply. Robeyns (2017) proposes limitarianism—upper bounds on permissible wealth holdings—but offers no threshold specification, leaving the proposal without clear action-guidance. Similarly, the precautionary savings literature establishes that wealth serves insurance purposes up to some adequacy level, but does not quantify this level for giving norm purposes. Effective altruism's 10% income pledge, by contrast, provides a concrete target, justified pragmatically as achievable and sustainable rather than theoretically derived (MacAskill 2015).

This gap reveals a practical asymmetry: income-based norms benefit from established percentage thresholds, while asset-based alternatives lack equivalent specification. The absence undermines the feasibility of asset-based approaches regardless of their theoretical superiority. The research project addresses this by proposing specific threshold criteria based on precautionary savings adequacy, drawing on household finance research to operationalize when the marginal utility argument for asset-based giving applies.

### Gap 4: Integration of Wealth Ethics and Utilitarian Giving Literature

Two substantial literatures—wealth ethics and utilitarian giving theory—address overlapping questions but remain poorly integrated. Wealth ethics examines taxation, inheritance, political equality, and intergenerational justice (Halliday 2018; Dietsch 2015; Volacu 2022), focusing on institutional redistribution. Utilitarian giving literature examines individual charitable obligations (Singer 1972; MacAskill 2019; Berkey 2021), focusing on personal donations. Cross-citation between these domains is limited, despite their common concern with resource distribution.

This separation matters because a stronger case for asset-based norms emerges from integrating multiple moral frameworks. Utilitarian marginal utility arguments suggest that wealth beyond security thresholds generates less welfare than equivalent income flows. Non-utilitarian considerations provide independent reinforcement: wealth transmission perpetuates inequality across generations (Halliday 2018), extreme wealth threatens political equality and democratic resilience (Volacu 2022), and mega-philanthropy depends on inequality that may itself be unjust (Wilson 2021). The research project synthesizes these strands, developing a pluralist case for asset-sensitive giving strategies that draws on both utilitarian and non-utilitarian considerations.

### Gap 5: Practical and Motivational Feasibility of Asset-Based Norms

Theoretical superiority is insufficient if norms cannot be implemented. Effective altruism's income-based norms succeeded partly due to psychological accessibility: income flows are regular, predictable, and integrate naturally into budgeting practices. Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom (2023) characterize pledge-takers' psychological profiles but do not compare the appeal of income versus wealth-based commitments. Meanwhile, Harrington (2016) documents how sophisticated legal structures enable wealth to evade obligations through offshore mechanisms, suggesting that asset-based norms face distinctive enforcement challenges. Hooker (2000) emphasizes that optimal moral rules must be learnable and internalizable, raising questions about whether complex asset-based calculations would satisfy these constraints.

This gap highlights a potential practical objection: even if asset-based norms are theoretically superior, income-based norms may win on implementation grounds. The research project acknowledges these challenges and considers hybrid approaches—such as asset-triggered income pledges—that might capture the theoretical benefits of asset-sensitivity while maintaining the practical feasibility of income-based frameworks. Andreoni and Serra-Garcia (2021) show that pledges function partly through information revelation and screening, suggesting that alternative pledge structures might preserve these psychological mechanisms while better tracking actual ability to give.

### Synthesis

These five gaps reveal that income-based giving norms became dominant not through principled defense but through unexamined inheritance from Singer's original framing and pragmatic operationalization by effective altruism. The research project addresses this by providing the first systematic comparison of income versus asset bases under expected-utility assumptions, developing theoretical models that distinguish their marginal utility profiles, proposing concrete threshold criteria for when asset-based obligations apply, integrating utilitarian and non-utilitarian considerations, and seriously engaging practical feasibility constraints. Whether or not asset-based norms ultimately prove superior, the case for income-based dominance requires explicit justification it has not yet received.


## Conclusion

The literature reviewed establishes that utilitarian theory generates substantial obligations to aid others in need, moderated by various limiting principles that address the demandingness objection. Singer's (1972) foundational argument, developed through decades of subsequent work by Kagan (1989), Murphy (1993), Cullity (2004), and others, creates strong prima facie requirements for charitable giving. The effective altruism movement has operationalized these obligations primarily through income-based norms, most notably the Giving What We Can pledge committing donors to ten percent of income (MacAskill 2015). Yet this income-based default, as the preceding analysis demonstrates, lacks principled philosophical justification.

The existing literature provides conceptual resources for asset-sensitive alternatives without developing them. Murphy's cooperative principle could calculate fair shares from wealth as readily as from income. Cullity's life-shaping constraint, which limits beneficence to preserve autonomous agency, might better track assets that provide genuine security rather than income flows that merely enable consumption. Aloyo (2023) alone has proposed progressive wealth-based giving as fairer than flat income-based tithing, though his analysis emphasizes justice considerations rather than utilitarian optimization.

The central insight emerging from this review is that assets beyond reasonable security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than income. Empirical research on precautionary savings demonstrates that wealth's primary function is insurance against income shocks (Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy 2013; Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar 2020). Once adequate buffers are established, additional wealth serves primarily positional purposes, signaling relative status rather than enabling new consumption (Ghosh and Wendner 2018). If this asymmetry holds, asset-based norms could generate greater aggregate welfare improvements than income-based alternatives by targeting resources with lower marginal utility to donors while maintaining the same benefit to recipients.

The research project addresses a clear gap in the literature by providing the first sustained utilitarian analysis of whether income-based or asset-based norms better serve beneficent goals. Expected contributions include: a theoretical framework comparing marginal utility profiles of income and wealth, threshold specifications identifying when assets transition from serving insurance to positional functions, integration of utilitarian giving theory with the wealth ethics literature on inheritance and political equality, and practical guidance for reforming philanthropic norms within effective altruism.

If asset-based norms prove theoretically superior, the implications extend beyond academic philosophy. The effective altruism movement has demonstrated remarkable success in promoting income-based pledges (Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom 2023), and its emphasis on evidence-based revision suggests receptivity to improved frameworks. Rule-consequentialist considerations about internalizability (Hooker 2000) will ultimately determine whether theoretically optimal asset-based norms can be translated into psychologically sustainable practice. The stakes are substantial: getting the metric right could significantly increase welfare gains from philanthropic giving without imposing greater sacrifice on donors.
