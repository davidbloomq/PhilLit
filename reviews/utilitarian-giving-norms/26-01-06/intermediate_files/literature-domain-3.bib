====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The marginal utility of money is a foundational concept in welfare economics,
measuring how additional income or wealth affects individual wellbeing. Classical
economics established that marginal utility diminishes as consumption increases —
each additional dollar provides less utility than the previous one. However, the
debate over whether income and wealth have identical marginal utility functions
remains unresolved. Recent empirical research distinguishes between the flow of
income and the stock of wealth, suggesting they serve different functions in
household welfare: income supports consumption, while wealth provides insurance,
optionality, and positional status.

The elasticity of marginal utility of income has been extensively studied for
policy applications including taxation, social discounting, and redistribution.
Meta-analyses suggest values around 1.2-2.0, implying logarithmic or near-
logarithmic utility functions. However, wealth introduces additional complexity:
assets serve precautionary purposes against income shocks, enable intertemporal
smoothing, and function as positional goods where relative wealth matters.
This positional character may cause wealth to have lower marginal utility at
high levels than income, as additional assets beyond insurance needs primarily
signal status rather than enable new consumption.

Recent theoretical work examines how positional preferences affect capital
accumulation and welfare, while empirical studies investigate the relationship
between subjective well-being and both absolute income and relative wealth.
The insurance motive for wealth accumulation appears particularly strong for
households facing income uncertainty, but diminishes significantly once adequate
precautionary savings are established.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research project's hypothesis that asset-based
giving norms may be more defensible than income-based norms under utilitarian
principles. If wealth has systematically lower marginal utility than income
(particularly at high wealth levels), then directing charitable obligations
toward assets rather than income flows could maximize aggregate welfare while
minimizing disruption to consumption patterns and labor incentives.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few studies directly compare the marginal utility of income versus wealth at
equivalent monetary values. The thresholds at which wealth transitions from
serving insurance functions to primarily positional functions remain poorly
quantified. The interaction between income uncertainty, wealth accumulation,
and marginal utility deserves more empirical investigation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this literature, distinguish carefully between theoretical
models of utility (which often conflate income and wealth) and empirical
findings (which increasingly recognize their distinct roles). The precautionary
savings literature provides strong evidence for the insurance value of wealth,
while the positional goods literature suggests diminishing returns at high
levels. Together, these strands support the hypothesis that marginal utility
of wealth declines more steeply than marginal utility of income.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical diminishing marginal utility (DMU): 8 papers - All income/wealth
  has declining marginal utility, supporting progressive redistribution
- Income vs. wealth distinction: 5 papers - Assets serve different functions
  than income flows, with implications for marginal utility
- Positional wealth effects: 5 papers - Relative wealth matters for utility,
  especially at high levels, suggesting steeper marginal utility decline

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using life satisfaction data across countries and within
  countries over time, the authors estimate that the elasticity of marginal
  utility of income is approximately 1.26, implying a logarithmic utility
  function. This means that a 1\% increase in income generates the same utility
  gain regardless of baseline income level. The finding is remarkably robust
  across different methodologies and datasets.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the empirical foundation for understanding how
  income affects welfare. The elasticity estimate near 1.0 supports using
  logarithmic utility in policy analysis. However, the paper does not distinguish
  between income and wealth effects, treating all monetary resources equivalently.
  This creates an opening for the research project to investigate whether wealth
  might have a different (steeper) elasticity than income flows.

  POSITION: Represents the happiness economics approach to estimating marginal
  utility, contrasting with consumption-based methods. Foundational for modern
  welfare economics.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Estimates the elasticity of marginal utility using consumption
  data rather than income data for 20 OECD countries. Finds elasticities ranging
  from 0.7 to 2.5 depending on the country and estimation method, with most
  estimates between 1.0 and 1.5. The variation suggests context-dependency in
  how consumption translates to utility.

  RELEVANCE: Provides an alternative estimation strategy focusing on consumption
  rather than income. The consumption-based approach is closer to measuring actual
  welfare changes, but still does not isolate wealth effects from income effects.
  The cross-country variation highlights that marginal utility may depend on
  institutional context and social norms, relevant when considering how giving
  norms might be culturally embedded.

  utility, providing empirical grounding for optimal taxation and cost-benefit

  CORE ARGUMENT: Synthesizes decades of empirical estimates to recommend an
  elasticity of 1.6 (with sensitivity bounds of 1.2-2.0) for policy applications.
  This meta-analysis shows that despite methodological differences, estimates
  cluster in a relatively narrow range, supporting the use of near-logarithmic
  utility functions in welfare economics. The recommended value balances
  theoretical plausibility with empirical evidence.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most recent and comprehensive synthesis of marginal
  utility estimates, offering a benchmark for policy applications. However, the
  meta-analysis combines studies of income and consumption without distinguishing
  wealth effects. The project could extend this by conducting separate analyses
  for income versus wealth elasticities, potentially finding that wealth has
  higher elasticity (steeper marginal utility decline).

  POSITION: Represents the current consensus in welfare economics, synthesizing
  both happiness-based and consumption-based approaches to produce policy-relevant
  recommendations.

  number = {4},
  pages = {1529--1535},
  doi = {10.1257/aer.103.4.1529},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Demonstrates that even individuals who are risk-loving (convex
  utility in wealth) still exhibit prudence — they accumulate precautionary
  savings against future income uncertainty. This surprising result shows that
  prudence (convex marginal utility) is more fundamental than risk aversion
  (concave utility) for explaining saving behavior. The precautionary motive
  persists across different risk attitudes.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the theoretical foundation for why wealth accumulation
  responds to income uncertainty even when individuals are not particularly risk-
  averse. This supports the view that wealth serves an insurance function distinct
  from pure consumption. Once adequate insurance has been achieved, additional
  wealth may have lower marginal utility because the precautionary motive is
  satiated, while income continues to enable consumption.

  POSITION: Advances the theoretical understanding of precautionary savings,
  showing that wealth accumulation for insurance purposes is robust across
  different utility specifications.

  number = {3},
  pages = {1760--1795},
  doi = {10.1093/restud/rdaa076},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses survey experiments to measure marginal propensity to consume
  from different types of income shocks. Finds enormous heterogeneity: some
  households spend nothing from windfall gains, while others spend most of it.
  Responses to losses are much larger and more widespread than responses to gains.
  A calibrated precautionary savings model with consumption adjustment costs can
  explain these patterns, particularly the role of low wealth levels in determining
  consumption responses.

  RELEVANCE: Provides direct evidence that wealth levels matter enormously for
  how households respond to income changes. Low-wealth households exhibit high
  marginal propensity to consume because they lack buffer stocks, while high-
  wealth households can smooth consumption. This asymmetry suggests that the
  marginal utility of wealth is much higher for low-wealth households (insurance
  motive) than for high-wealth households (who have adequate buffers). Critical
  for understanding threshold effects in wealth's marginal utility.

  POSITION: Represents the empirical household finance literature showing that
  wealth provides consumption insurance, with implications for marginal utility
  varying by wealth level.

  number = {1},
  pages = {114--140},
  doi = {10.1093/oep/gpx027},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes an economy where households care about both absolute
  wealth (for consumption and bequest motives) and relative wealth (for status).
  Shows that positional preferences lead to over-accumulation of capital relative
  to the social optimum because individuals don't internalize the negative
  externality of reducing others' relative position. The welfare loss from
  positional competition increases with the strength of status concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how wealth functions as a positional good,
  supporting the hypothesis that marginal utility of wealth may decline steeply
  at high levels because additional wealth primarily affects relative position
  rather than absolute welfare. This creates a wedge between private and social
  marginal utility of wealth. Relevant for understanding why asset-based giving
  norms might correct positional externalities.

  wealth accumulation, showing how status concerns affect both private behavior
  and social welfare.

  number = {2},
  pages = {341--360},
  doi = {10.1007/s11098-013-0099-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that prioritarians should care about positional goods
  because they affect people's absolute wellbeing, not just their relative
  standing. When goods have positional characteristics, their value depends
  partly on scarcity, which creates genuine welfare differences. Prioritarians
  and egalitarians can converge on limiting access to positional goods even
  though they start from different moral premises.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for why utilitarian analysis
  should account for positional characteristics of wealth. If wealth is
  partially positional, then its marginal utility depends not only on absolute
  level but also on the distribution in society. This supports the project's
  investigation of whether asset-based norms might be more efficient than
  income-based norms when wealth has strong positional components.

  POSITION: Bridges egalitarian and prioritarian approaches to positional goods,
  showing convergence on policy recommendations despite different philosophical
  foundations.

  number = {1},
  pages = {53--66},
  doi = {10.20955/r.2015.53-66},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Estimates the coefficient of relative risk aversion using
  happiness data from 75 countries in the Gallup World Poll. Finds that risk
  aversion clusters around 1 (logarithmic utility) across countries, validating
  the use of log utility in economic models. This consistency across diverse
  contexts suggests that logarithmic utility is a reasonable approximation for
  aggregate welfare analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides cross-country evidence supporting the logarithmic utility
  assumption that underlies much of the marginal utility literature. The finding
  that risk aversion ≈ 1 is consistent with marginal utility elasticity ≈ 1,
  supporting the Layard et al. estimates. However, like other studies, this does
  not distinguish between income and wealth, leaving open the question of whether
  wealth might have different characteristics.

  POSITION: Represents the happiness economics approach applied at country level,
  finding remarkable consistency in risk attitudes that supports standard
  economic modeling assumptions.

  doi = {10.5840/soctheorpract2021917137},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes wedding expenditure as a form of positional consumption
  where participants signal both commitment to their relationship and personal
  wealth. Shows how markets for positional goods can generate wasteful competition
  as individuals compete for relative position. The analysis distinguishes between
  different types of signaling and their welfare implications.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates concretely how wealth is used for positional signaling
  in actual consumption decisions. Wedding expenditure is a clear example where
  additional wealth goes toward relative position rather than absolute welfare,
  supporting the hypothesis that wealth's marginal utility declines steeply once
  basic needs and insurance are met. Provides a case study of how positional
  competition operates in real markets.

  POSITION: Applies positional goods theory to a specific consumption domain,
  demonstrating how relative concerns drive spending decisions in ways that may
  not maximize welfare.

  pages = {745--767},
  doi = {10.1007/s11205-021-02619-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses panel data to show that education has both consumption
  value (direct utility from learning) and positional value (utility from
  relative educational standing). The positional component is substantial:
  life satisfaction depends not only on one's own education but also on the
  distribution of education in one's reference group. This positional character
  has implications for education policy.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates empirically that positional characteristics are not
  limited to luxury goods but extend to goods like education that are often
  considered primarily non-positional. This strengthens the case that wealth,
  which is more obviously used for status signaling, likely has even stronger
  positional components. Provides methodological insights for detecting
  positional effects in wellbeing data.

  POSITION: Extends positional goods theory to education, providing empirical
  evidence for positional components in goods traditionally considered as
  investments in human capital.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Turkish life satisfaction survey data to test two
  hypotheses: (1) income inequality within reference groups reduces happiness,
  and (2) housing functions as a positional good with negative externalities.
  Finds support for both hypotheses. The study shows that relative concerns
  matter substantially for wellbeing even in a middle-income country context.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence that housing (a major component of
  household wealth) operates as a positional good. Since housing is the largest
  asset for most households, this finding directly supports the hypothesis that
  wealth has positional characteristics. The negative effect of reference group
  inequality suggests that wealth redistribution could improve aggregate welfare
  by reducing positional competition.

  pages = {475--495},
  doi = {10.3368/le.94.4.475},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses laboratory experiments to test how land value taxation
  performs relative to property taxation, with a focus on the positional good
  character of land. Finds that participants systematically overinvest in land
  when it functions as a positional good, but this effect disappears when the
  positional indicator is removed. Surprisingly, participants voted for land
  value tax despite theoretical predictions of opposition.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates experimentally that the positional character of assets
  (land) drives overinvestment and inefficiency. Removing positional signaling
  eliminates the overinvestment, confirming that status concerns rather than
  consumption motives drive accumulation at high levels. This supports the
  hypothesis that marginal utility of wealth declines steeply when wealth
  primarily serves positional rather than consumption or insurance functions.

  POSITION: Provides experimental evidence for positional characteristics of
  wealth using land as a test case, showing both inefficiency from positional
  competition and potential policy responses.

  journal = {SocArXiv},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/xsqzp},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that a universal basic income (UBI) is less effective
  at maximizing welfare than a non-universal basic income that adjusts for prior
  income and wealth. The key insight is that diminishing marginal utility of
  money means that transfers should be concentrated on those with lowest resources,
  not distributed equally to all. A wealth-adjusted transfer scheme would better
  account for marginal utility differences.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applies diminishing marginal utility logic to policy design,
  arguing for wealth-adjusted rather than universal transfers. This parallels
  the research project's investigation of whether giving norms should be based
  on wealth rather than income. The paper's utilitarian framework and attention
  to marginal utility differences provides a model for how to analyze asset-based
  versus income-based norms.

  POSITION: Applies utilitarian principles to basic income debates, emphasizing
  the importance of accounting for diminishing marginal utility in transfer

  doi = {10.1093/oep/gpad034},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes whether public provision of positional goods can
  correct inefficiencies from status competition. When consumers face a discrete
  choice between private and public alternatives, providing the public option
  for free or subsidized can reduce excessive consumption of positional goods.
  Shows conditions under which public provision can implement efficiency and
  when it serves as a useful second-best policy.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical framework for how policy can address positional
  externalities through public provision rather than taxation. While the paper
  focuses on public goods, the logic extends to policies that discourage
  accumulation of positional wealth. Relevant for understanding how norms or
  policies might channel resources away from positional wealth accumulation
  toward more welfare-enhancing uses like charitable giving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the inference from diminishing marginal utility to
  egalitarian redistribution. Argues that even if marginal utility declines with
  wealth, other factors (incentive effects, respect for property rights, dynamic
  effects on production) may override the static welfare gains from redistribution.
  The paper distinguishes between utility-maximizing redistribution in theory
  versus the real-world consequences of redistribution policies.

  RELEVANCE: Provides an important counterpoint to naive applications of
  diminishing marginal utility to redistribution policy. While the paper argues
  against egalitarian redistribution, its analysis is relevant for understanding
  the limits of marginal utility arguments. The research project must address
  these concerns when proposing asset-based giving norms: demonstrating that
  such norms avoid the incentive problems that plague forced redistribution.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops formal methods for comparing risk aversion across

  savings supports the view that wealth serves an insurance function. Once

  pages = {108--123},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jmacro.2015.04.001},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Shows that ignoring the precautionary savings motive leads to
  biased estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. When

  RELEVANCE: Highlights the importance of distinguishing between different
  motives for wealth accumulation when estimating utility parameters. The
  precautionary motive is particularly relevant for understanding how marginal
  utility of wealth varies with wealth levels: high at low wealth (where
  precautionary needs are unmet) but declining steeply once adequate insurance

  number = {4},
  pages = {589--597},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends the use of consumer surplus as a welfare measure by
  deriving rigorous bounds on the approximation error relative to compensating
  and equivalent variations. Shows that consumer surplus is often a very good
  approximation to the theoretically correct welfare measures, with errors
  typically smaller than estimation errors in demand curves. Validates consumer
  surplus for empirical policy analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides methodological foundation for using consumer surplus in
  welfare analysis, which is relevant when evaluating the welfare effects of
  policies affecting income or wealth. The paper's emphasis on practical
  approximation versus theoretical precision is relevant for the research
  project: perfect distinction between income and wealth effects may not be
  necessary if the approximation errors are small relative to the magnitude
  of the welfare differences.
