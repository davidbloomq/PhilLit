====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the strongest philosophical objections to utilitarian demands
for charitable giving, including the demandingness objection, critiques of effective
altruism, and non-utilitarian perspectives on beneficence. The demandingness objection,
articulated prominently by Scheffler, Murphy, and others, argues that utilitarianism
makes unreasonably high demands on moral agents. Murphy's "The Demands of Beneficence"
(1993) is foundational, proposing a cooperative principle that limits individual
obligations based on what others are doing. Cullity's "The Moral Demands of Affluence"
(2004) provides the most comprehensive treatment, arguing against simple cost-based
limits while defending a more nuanced account. Hooker's demandingness objection
distinguishes different dimensions of demandingness and their relevance to moral
theory. Recent work extends these objections to effective altruism specifically,
with Gabriel's "Effective Altruism and its Critics" (2017) cataloging objections
from justice, special obligations, and systemic change perspectives. The institutional
critique, developed by Berkey and Dietz, argues EA neglects structural reforms.
Alternative frameworks include Pearlman's mutual aid model and virtue ethics
approaches to charitable giving.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for balanced analysis of income vs. asset-based giving norms.
If demandingness objections apply to income-based norms, they apply with equal or
greater force to asset-based norms (which are more demanding). If critics are correct
that the status quo reflects appropriate limits on beneficence, this undermines
both proposals. Understanding these objections helps identify which features of giving
norms generate demandingness concerns: is it the overall sacrifice required, the
encroachment on personal projects, or something else? This analysis is crucial for
determining whether asset-based norms would face distinctive objections beyond those
facing income-based norms.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers directly address the income vs. asset distinction in demandingness
discussions. Most critiques focus on overall sacrifice levels rather than the form
wealth takes. Limited discussion of how liquidity and fungibility affect moral
demandingness. Virtue ethics and deontological alternatives to utilitarian giving
are underdeveloped compared to the demandingness literature itself.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare how demandingness objections apply to income-based vs. asset-based norms.
Consider whether asset illiquidity provides independent moral relevance or merely
affects perceived sacrifice. Examine whether critics' concerns about personal
projects and integrity apply differently to wealth stocks vs. flows. Note tensions
between institutional critiques of EA (favoring systemic change) and arguments for
limited individual obligations.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Demandingness as limiting principle (Murphy, Cullity, Hooker): 7 papers
- Effective altruism critiques (Gabriel, Berkey, Syme, Ioannidis): 5 papers
- Alternative frameworks (Pearlman, mutual aid, virtue ethics): 3 papers

@article{murphy1993demands,
  author = {Murphy, Liam B.},
  title = {The Demands of Beneficence},

  volume = {22},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy argues against Singer's demanding principle of beneficence by proposing a cooperative alternative: individuals are only required to contribute their fair share toward optimal outcomes, not to compensate for others' failures to contribute. He defends a collective principle of beneficence that limits individual obligations when others do not comply, rejecting both the demanding consequentialist view and the minimalist view that limits obligations based on personal cost alone.

  RELEVANCE: This is foundational for understanding objections to demanding giving norms. Murphy's cooperative principle would apply equally to both income-based and asset-based norms, potentially limiting both. His framework suggests that the demandingness problem is not primarily about what form wealth takes (income vs. assets) but about the overall level of sacrifice and fairness considerations when compliance is non-ideal. This challenges any proposal that asset-based norms should be more demanding simply because assets represent accumulated wealth.

  POSITION: Limits beneficence through cooperative fairness rather than personal cost. Represents the most influential non-utilitarian constraint on demanding giving obligations.

@book{cullity2004moral,
  author = {Cullity, Garrett},
  title = {The Moral Demands of Affluence},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2004},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity provides the most comprehensive defense against the demandingness objection. He rejects simple cost-based limits on beneficence but defends moderate limits by showing how reasonable beneficence can be demanding without being unreasonably demanding. He argues that the life-compromising test (whether fulfilling all moral requirements would prevent living a worthwhile life) provides a principled limit on beneficence demands, while rejecting Murphy's cooperative principle and cost-based approaches as insufficiently grounded.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for evaluating whether asset-based norms would be unreasonably demanding. Cullity's framework suggests that demandingness depends not just on total sacrifice but on whether obligations prevent living a worthwhile life. This implies that asset-based norms might be more problematic than income-based norms if they threaten long-term security and life plans in ways that annual income sacrifices do not. His rejection of cost-based limits also suggests that mere inconvenience or illiquidity of assets provides insufficient grounds for exempting them from beneficence demands.

  POSITION: Moderate limits on beneficence justified by life-compromising concerns, not simple costs. The most thorough contemporary treatment of demandingness in affluence contexts.

  booktitle = {The Ethics of Assistance},
  editor = {Chatterjee, Deen K.},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  year = {2004},
  pages = {33--58},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511817663.004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arneson critically examines various proposals for limiting beneficence demands, including Murphy's cooperative principle and cost-based limits. He argues that many proposed limits lack principled justification and that we may need to accept more demanding obligations than common sense morality suggests. He distinguishes between limits based on personal prerogatives versus limits based on fairness or coordination problems.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical perspective on whether proposed limits to beneficence (including those based on asset illiquidity or personal project protection) are genuinely principled or merely rationalizations of self-interest. His analysis suggests that arguments for exempting assets from giving norms must be scrutinized carefully - asset illiquidity may not provide a principled limit any more than other forms of personal cost do. This challenges proposals that treat income and assets asymmetrically without strong justification.

  POSITION: Skeptical of proposed limits on beneficence; demands rigorous justification for constraints on utilitarian demands.

@inbook{hooker2009demandingness,
  author = {Hooker, Brad},
  title = {The Demandingness Objection},
  booktitle = {The Problem of Moral Demandingness},
  editor = {Chappell, Timothy},
  publisher = {Palgrave Macmillan},
  address = {Basingstoke},
  year = {2009},
  pages = {148--162},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker distinguishes between different dimensions of demandingness - time demands, attention demands, decision-making costs, and sacrifice of personal goals. He argues that impartial act-consequentialism's requirement of beneficence toward strangers is objectionably demanding primarily in how it threatens personal projects and integrity, not merely in aggregate sacrifice. He defends rule-consequentialism as avoiding excessive demandingness while maintaining impartial concern.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how income vs. asset norms differ in their demandingness. Hooker's dimensional analysis suggests that asset-based norms might be demanding in distinctive ways - not just in quantity of sacrifice but in threatening long-term security, disrupting established plans, and requiring constant recalculation of net worth. Income-based norms may be less demanding along these dimensions even if equivalent in aggregate sacrifice, because income flows are more predictable and less tied to identity and life plans than accumulated assets.

  POSITION: Demandingness objection succeeds against act-consequentialism but rule-consequentialism provides an adequate response.

@article{gabriel2017effective,
  author = {Gabriel, Iason},
  title = {Effective Altruism and its Critics},
  journal = {Journal of Applied Philosophy},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {34},
  number = {4},
  pages = {457--473},
  doi = {10.1111/JAPP.12176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically categorizes objections to effective altruism, identifying three main strands: (1) justice-based critiques arguing EA neglects structural inequality and rights, (2) special obligations critiques arguing EA's impartialism ignores legitimate partiality to family and community, and (3) epistemic critiques about EA's confidence in quantitative assessments. He argues that while EA can accommodate many concerns, there are genuine tensions with justice frameworks that prioritize equality and urgency over aggregate welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Provides framework for anticipating objections to both income-based and asset-based utilitarian giving norms. The justice critique applies equally to both, but the special obligations critique might apply differently - family obligations may include maintaining assets for inheritance or intergenerational transfer, potentially exempting some assets from immediate giving demands. The epistemic critique also applies to asset valuations, which are often less precise than income measurements. This suggests asset-based norms face additional implementation challenges beyond those facing income-based norms.

  POSITION: EA can partially accommodate critics' concerns but faces genuine tensions with non-welfarist moral frameworks, especially regarding distributive justice.

@article{berkey2018institutional,
  author = {Berkey, Brian},
  title = {The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Utilitas},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {30},
  number = {2},
  pages = {143--171},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey examines the institutional critique that EA focuses excessively on individual charitable giving while neglecting systemic institutional change. He argues this critique is often misunderstood - properly understood, EA's core commitments (doing the most good one can) are compatible with pursuing institutional reform. However, the EA movement in practice has tended to favor individual-level interventions, partly due to measurability concerns and partly due to implicit assumptions about the limits of individual political efficacy.

  RELEVANCE: The institutional critique applies to the entire project of focusing on individual giving norms (whether income-based or asset-based). If critics are correct that individual charity is less effective than political advocacy for structural change, then debates about income vs. asset norms may be addressing the wrong question. However, Berkey's analysis suggests the critique targets EA's practical focus rather than its core principles, so refined giving norms could still be valuable even if supplemented by institutional advocacy. Asset-based norms might be especially susceptible to this critique if they focus attention on individual wealth management rather than systemic inequality.

  POSITION: Institutional critique points to genuine limitations in EA practice but does not refute EA's core principles; EA should incorporate more attention to systemic change.

@article{dietz2019effective,

  title = {Effective Altruism and Collective Obligations},
  journal = {Utilitas},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {31},
  number = {1},
  pages = {106--115},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820818000158},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz argues that EA relies on an overly individualistic approach to ethics that neglects collective obligations and coordination problems. Drawing on act-utilitarianism's well-known problems with collective action, he contends that focusing on what each individual can do leads to suboptimal outcomes when collective action would be more effective. He defends a version of the institutional critique grounded in collective obligation theory rather than empirical claims about institutional effectiveness.

  RELEVANCE: This critique applies to individual-level giving norms generally, whether income-based or asset-based. However, it might apply with special force to asset-based norms, which require more complex coordination and information-sharing than income-based norms. For example, determining appropriate asset sacrifice levels requires knowledge of what others with similar asset positions are doing, creating coordination challenges. Income-based norms, being more standardized and easier to implement through existing tax-like mechanisms, may face fewer collective action problems.

  POSITION: EA's individualistic focus neglects collective obligations and institutional coordination; effective altruists should prioritize collective action over individual optimization.

  year = {2016},
  volume = {73},
  pages = {92--99},
  doi = {10.5840/TPM20167379},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMahan surveys major philosophical objections to EA, including concerns about demandingness, neglect of special obligations, insensitivity to agent-relative reasons, and problems with measuring and comparing welfare across different contexts. He notes that while EA has utilitarian roots, many of its practical recommendations could be endorsed from other moral frameworks, though tensions remain particularly around questions of partiality and the scope of moral obligation.

  RELEVANCE: Provides overview of how multiple philosophical frameworks (deontology, virtue ethics, care ethics) would evaluate utilitarian giving demands. These alternative frameworks might evaluate income vs. asset norms differently - for instance, virtue ethics might see preserving family assets as expressing appropriate family loyalty, while deontology might recognize stronger property rights over accumulated wealth than over future income. Understanding these alternative frameworks helps identify which objections apply specifically to asset-based proposals versus utilitarian giving demands generally.

  POSITION: EA faces serious objections from non-utilitarian moral theories, particularly regarding demandingness, partiality, and agent-relative reasons, though some practical convergence is possible.

@article{syme2019charity,
  author = {Syme, Timothy},
  title = {Charity vs. Revolution: Effective Altruism and the Systemic Change Objection},
  journal = {Ethical Theory and Moral Practice},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {22},
  number = {1},
  pages = {93--120},
  doi = {10.1007/S10677-019-09979-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Syme examines the systemic change objection to EA - that individual charity is ineffective compared to revolutionary structural change addressing root causes of poverty and suffering. He argues that EA's emphasis on measurable impact and marginal effectiveness biases it toward status quo interventions, missing potentially high-impact systemic changes. However, he contends that this is a contingent feature of EA practice rather than a necessary implication of its core principles, and that EA could incorporate systemic change interventions if they prove more effective.

  RELEVANCE: This critique challenges the entire framing of individual giving obligations (whether based on income or assets). If systemic change is vastly more effective, debates about optimal individual giving norms may be misguided. However, the critique might apply differently to asset-based norms: large accumulated assets could potentially fund systemic change efforts (advocacy organizations, political campaigns, movement-building) more effectively than annual income flows. This suggests that if asset-based norms were adopted, they might direct giving toward systemic change rather than direct service provision.

  POSITION: EA's methodological biases toward measurable short-term interventions cause it to undervalue systemic change, though this is correctable within EA's framework.

  title = {Shackling the Poor, or Effective Altruism: A Critique of the Philosophical Foundation of Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Conatus},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {5},
  number = {2},
  pages = {25--46},
  doi = {10.12681/CJP.22296},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ioannidis offers a radical critique of EA's philosophical foundations, arguing that EA is not authentic altruism because it is founded on the sacrifice and objectification of the other (the aid recipient). Drawing on Levinasian ethics, he contends that EA's utilitarian calculus treats beneficiaries as means to the donor's goal of maximizing good, rather than as ends in themselves with dignity and agency. This critique extends to EA's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and measurable outcomes, which he sees as dehumanizing.

  RELEVANCE: This philosophical critique applies to utilitarian giving norms generally, whether income-based or asset-based, because both frameworks treat beneficiaries as locations for utility improvement rather than autonomous agents. However, the critique might have distinctive application to asset-based norms: accumulated wealth often has personal and family significance that income flows lack, so asset-based giving might involve even more instrumentalization of others' needs to justify sacrificing personally meaningful property. This suggests that non-utilitarian frameworks might favor preserving assets over income for agent-centered rather than consequentialist reasons.

  POSITION: EA's utilitarian foundations are ethically problematic because they objectify beneficiaries and reduce ethics to calculation; authentic altruism requires recognition of the other's infinite worth.

@article{pearlman2023solidarity,

  title = {Solidarity Over Charity: Mutual Aid as a Moral Alternative to Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {33},
  number = {2},
  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman argues against Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism (OOEA) and its demand to give to the most effective causes rather than to people or causes we care about. She defends Mutual Aid as a morally superior alternative that embraces partiality, builds community, and respects local knowledge. Mutual Aid networks involve reciprocal support among community members, usually geographically proximate, sharing material goods and social support based on solidarity rather than cost-effectiveness calculations.

  RELEVANCE: This critique challenges the impartialism underlying both income-based and asset-based utilitarian giving norms. However, it might apply differently to assets versus income: mutual aid frameworks often involve sharing assets (housing, tools, equipment) more than redistributing income, suggesting assets have distinctive roles in solidarity-based giving. The mutual aid model also emphasizes reciprocity and relationship, which may be easier to sustain with asset-sharing than with income redistribution. This suggests that asset-based norms might need to incorporate relational and reciprocal dimensions that income-based norms do not.

  POSITION: Rejecting OOEA's impartial demandingness in favor of partial, community-based mutual aid as a legitimate way to discharge duties to help others.

  title = {How Much More Demanding is Utilitarianism than Common Sense Morality?},
  journal = {Revue internationale de philosophie},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {66},
  number = {4},
  pages = {427--438},
  doi = {10.3917/rip.266.0427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lazari-Radek and Singer respond to the demandingness objection by acknowledging that utilitarianism does demand more than common sense morality but arguing that conditions have changed since Sidgwick's time, widening this gap. They contend that common sense morality needs to change to reflect modern conditions (global inequality, effectiveness of aid, our knowledge of suffering), not that utilitarianism should be rejected. They defend the view that those in affluent societies should give much more than currently regarded as obligatory.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether utilitarian demands (including potential asset-based demands) should be rejected as too demanding or whether common sense morality should be revised upward. Their argument that changed conditions justify greater demands could support asset-based norms: the massive wealth inequality that has emerged in recent decades, with some individuals holding billions while others starve, might constitute a changed condition justifying demands on accumulated wealth that would have been inappropriate in earlier eras. This provides utilitarian grounds for reconsidering asset exemptions.

  POSITION: Defends utilitarian demandingness against the objection; argues that common sense morality should become more demanding to match utilitarian requirements.

  year = {2020},
  pages = {253--274},
  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190905323.013.13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sobel argues that for the demandingness objection to succeed against consequentialism, it must explain which costs are deemed especially demanding and why morality should prioritize avoiding those costs. He shows that the objection cannot function as persuasive critique without prioritizing some costs (e.g., threats to personal projects, integrity) over others (e.g., material sacrifice, inconvenience). He considers and rejects various ways of making this prioritization, ultimately expressing skepticism about the objection's success.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for evaluating whether asset illiquidity or attachment constitutes a relevant kind of cost that makes asset-based norms especially demanding. Sobel's analysis suggests that simply noting that asset liquidation is inconvenient or psychologically costly is insufficient - we need an account of why these particular costs should limit moral demands. This challenges proposals to exempt assets based merely on illiquidity or personal attachment without showing why these features matter morally rather than just prudentially. His framework demands more sophisticated justification for treating income and assets differently.

  POSITION: Skeptical that the demandingness objection can meet the challenge of explaining why certain costs should constrain morality without begging the question against consequentialism.

  pages = {225--242},
  doi = {10.1111/J.1467-9213.2009.609.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hills examines whether contractualism (Scanlon's version) can provide principled limits on demandingness that utilitarianism lacks. She argues that contractualism's appeal to what could not be reasonably rejected does not straightforwardly generate less demanding requirements than utilitarianism. In many cases, contractualist reasoning supports similarly demanding obligations because refusing to help those in dire need when one could do so at moderate cost would be reasonably rejectable. She concludes that contractualism may not escape demandingness concerns as decisively as sometimes thought.

  RELEVANCE: Examines whether non-utilitarian frameworks (contractualism) provide resources for limiting giving demands in ways that would support income-based over asset-based norms. Hills' analysis suggests that contractualism might support similarly demanding obligations regardless of wealth form, because those in dire need could reasonably reject principles that exempt accumulated wealth from helping obligations. This implies that attempts to justify income/asset asymmetry by appealing to contractualist reasonable rejection may fail - those dying of preventable diseases could reasonably reject principles that protect donors' wealth accumulation.

  POSITION: Contractualism does not provide clear escape from demandingness concerns; reasonable rejection framework may support demanding obligations similar to utilitarianism.

  volume = {44},
  number = {2},
  pages = {169--191},
  doi = {10.1111/JOSP.12018},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Braddock defends utilitarian demands against the demandingness objection by arguing that the intuitions supporting the objection are unreliable. He draws on empirical psychology showing that moral intuitions are subject to various biases and distortions, including self-serving bias, status quo bias, and psychological distance effects. He argues that our intuitions about how demanding morality should be are particularly suspect because we have strong motivations to avoid demanding moral requirements, making these intuitions more likely products of rationalization than genuine moral insight.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges reliance on intuitions that income-based norms are appropriately limited or that assets should be exempt from giving demands. Braddock's argument suggests that intuitions favoring less demanding norms (whether by limiting income obligations or exempting assets entirely) may reflect self-serving bias rather than principled moral reasoning. This supports revisiting both income-based and asset-based norms without deferring to status quo intuitions. However, it provides no guidance on whether asset-based or income-based norms are superior, only that both should be evaluated by reasons rather than intuitions.

  POSITION: Defends utilitarian demandingness by debunking the intuitions underlying demandingness objections as products of bias rather than reliable moral insight.
