## Introduction

Utilitarian moral theory generates demanding obligations to aid those in need. Peter Singer's (1972) foundational argument establishes that if we can prevent suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. When applied to global poverty, this principle implies that affluent individuals should give substantially—perhaps until the point where further giving would cause comparable harm to themselves. Shelly Kagan (1989) defends an uncompromising version of this view, rejecting agent-centered prerogatives that would limit beneficence requirements. The result is a theoretical framework that appears to demand significant sacrifice from those with resources to spare.

Contemporary philanthropic movements have sought to operationalize these obligations through practical giving norms. The effective altruism movement, articulated most prominently by William MacAskill (2015), combines utilitarian concern for maximizing impact with evidence-based evaluation of charitable interventions. Central to this movement is the Giving What We Can pledge—a commitment to donate at least ten percent of one's income to effective charities. This income-based standard has become the flagship operationalization of utilitarian giving obligations, adopted by thousands of individuals seeking to act on their moral commitments (Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom 2023).

Yet the dominance of income-based giving norms lacks explicit philosophical defense. Liam Murphy's (1993) cooperative principle, which limits individual obligations to a fair share of what would be required under full compliance, could in principle be applied to either income or accumulated assets. The demandingness literature more broadly (Cullity 2004; Scheffler 1982) constrains the extent of sacrifice morality may require, but remains silent on whether that sacrifice should be calculated from income flows or asset stocks. The ten percent income standard appears to have emerged from pragmatic considerations—predictability, psychological accessibility, ease of implementation—rather than principled utilitarian reasoning about which metric best captures an individual's capacity to give without comparable sacrifice.

This silence is philosophically significant. Empirical research on the marginal utility of money suggests that additional resources provide diminishing welfare benefits (Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell 2008). However, income and wealth may have systematically different marginal utility profiles. Assets beyond reasonable security thresholds serve primarily positional functions—signaling relative status rather than enabling additional consumption—while income continues to fund ongoing welfare. If this asymmetry holds, then asset-based giving norms might generate greater aggregate welfare improvements than income-based alternatives for a given level of donor sacrifice.

Eamon Aloyo (2023) has recently proposed progressive wealth-based giving as a fairer alternative to income-based tithing, arguing that accumulated wealth better captures historical advantages and net financial position. Yet his argument emphasizes fairness rather than utilitarian optimization, leaving open the central question this review addresses: given that marginal utility theory applies differently to income flows versus asset stocks, should utilitarian giving norms be reformulated around assets?

This review examines the theoretical foundations and practical implications of this question. It proceeds by analyzing utilitarian giving obligations and their limits, developing the case for income-asset asymmetry in marginal utility, identifying gaps in the existing literature, and considering what a principled asset-sensitive approach to philanthropic norms might require. The aim is not to reject income-based giving, but to interrogate an unexamined default and assess whether asset-based alternatives merit serious philosophical attention.
