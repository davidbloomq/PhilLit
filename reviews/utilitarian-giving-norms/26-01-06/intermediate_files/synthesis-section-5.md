## Conclusion

The literature reviewed establishes that utilitarian theory generates substantial obligations to aid others in need, moderated by various limiting principles that address the demandingness objection. Singer's (1972) foundational argument, developed through decades of subsequent work by Kagan (1989), Murphy (1993), Cullity (2004), and others, creates strong prima facie requirements for charitable giving. The effective altruism movement has operationalized these obligations primarily through income-based norms, most notably the Giving What We Can pledge committing donors to ten percent of income (MacAskill 2015). Yet this income-based default, as the preceding analysis demonstrates, lacks principled philosophical justification.

The existing literature provides conceptual resources for asset-sensitive alternatives without developing them. Murphy's cooperative principle could calculate fair shares from wealth as readily as from income. Cullity's life-shaping constraint, which limits beneficence to preserve autonomous agency, might better track assets that provide genuine security rather than income flows that merely enable consumption. Aloyo (2023) alone has proposed progressive wealth-based giving as fairer than flat income-based tithing, though his analysis emphasizes justice considerations rather than utilitarian optimization.

The central insight emerging from this review is that assets beyond reasonable security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than income. Empirical research on precautionary savings demonstrates that wealth's primary function is insurance against income shocks (Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy 2013; Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar 2020). Once adequate buffers are established, additional wealth serves primarily positional purposes, signaling relative status rather than enabling new consumption (Ghosh and Wendner 2018). If this asymmetry holds, asset-based norms could generate greater aggregate welfare improvements than income-based alternatives by targeting resources with lower marginal utility to donors while maintaining the same benefit to recipients.

The research project addresses a clear gap in the literature by providing the first sustained utilitarian analysis of whether income-based or asset-based norms better serve beneficent goals. Expected contributions include: a theoretical framework comparing marginal utility profiles of income and wealth, threshold specifications identifying when assets transition from serving insurance to positional functions, integration of utilitarian giving theory with the wealth ethics literature on inheritance and political equality, and practical guidance for reforming philanthropic norms within effective altruism.

If asset-based norms prove theoretically superior, the implications extend beyond academic philosophy. The effective altruism movement has demonstrated remarkable success in promoting income-based pledges (Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom 2023), and its emphasis on evidence-based revision suggests receptivity to improved frameworks. Rule-consequentialist considerations about internalizability (Hooker 2000) will ultimately determine whether theoretically optimal asset-based norms can be translated into psychologically sustainable practice. The stakes are substantial: getting the metric right could significantly increase welfare gains from philanthropic giving without imposing greater sacrifice on donors.
