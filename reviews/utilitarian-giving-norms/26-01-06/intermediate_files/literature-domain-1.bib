====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the core utilitarian arguments establishing moral obligations
to aid others, particularly in contexts of global poverty. The foundational work is
Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972), which argues from utilitarian
premises that preventing suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral
importance is obligatory. This triggers a debate about demandingness: how much can
morality require? Three main positions emerge:

1. MAXIMIZING CONSEQUENTIALISM (Singer, Kagan, Unger): The right act is the one
   producing the most good impartially considered. This demands giving until one
   reaches the level of those aided (or until marginal costs equal marginal benefits).

2. MODERATE VIEWS (Murphy, Cullity, Scheffler): These accept agent-centered
   prerogatives and place limits on beneficence obligations. Murphy's "cooperative
   principle" limits obligations to one's fair share assuming full compliance.
   Cullity develops a sophisticated account of how to balance personal projects
   against beneficence.

3. INDIRECT UTILITARIANISM (Hooker, Brandt): Rule utilitarianism and indirect
   approaches argue that adopting moderate principles of beneficence may produce
   better consequences than demanding act-utilitarian requirements.

Recent developments include effective altruism (MacAskill) which operationalizes
utilitarian obligations through evidence-based giving, and debates about whether
EA's emphasis on effectiveness is itself morally mandatory or merely advisable.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the project's investigation of income-based vs. asset-based
norms for charitable giving. The utilitarian tradition provides the theoretical
foundation for any mandatory giving norm grounded in marginal utility considerations.
The debate about demandingness directly addresses how to specify such norms without
requiring extreme sacrifice. Murphy's work on fair-share principles and Cullity's
analysis of iterative reasoning provide frameworks for setting reasonable thresholds.
MacAskill's effective altruism introduces the question of whether norms should specify
not just how much to give, but how effectively to give.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Surprisingly little discussion of asset-based vs. income-based formulations of
beneficence obligations. Most literature assumes income as the metric. Limited
engagement with how different utilitarian theories (act, rule, indirect) would
evaluate specific giving thresholds like 10% income vs. asset-based norms. The
marginal utility of assets beyond security thresholds receives minimal attention
in this literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should trace the development from Singer's demanding position through
various moderating moves (agent-centered prerogatives, cooperative principles,
satisficing) to contemporary effective altruism. Key question: Do utilitarian
foundations support percentage-of-income norms (like 10% pledges) or would they
favor asset-based norms given diminishing marginal utility of wealth accumulation?

  author = {Singer, Peter},
  title = {The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty},

  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Yale University Press},
  address = {New Haven},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer extends his 1972 argument with updated empirical evidence and practical guidance. He argues that the affluent have strong obligations to give effectively to address extreme poverty, introducing a graduated giving scale (10-33% of income based on wealth). The book bridges utilitarian theory and effective altruism practice.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's focus on income-based giving norms. Singer's graduated scale provides a concrete operationalization of utilitarian obligations, but raises the question of why income rather than assets should be the metric. His pragmatic accommodations to demandingness worries illustrate how maximizing consequentialism gets moderated in practice.

  POSITION: Represents moderate utilitarian consequentialism with practical accommodations. Singer maintains the core duty to maximize good but accepts graduated requirements that fall short of full sacrifice.

  author = {Kagan, Shelly},
  title = {The Limits of Morality},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0198239165.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kagan defends an uncompromising consequentialism without agent-centered prerogatives or constraints. He argues that common moral intuitions supporting limits on beneficence obligations rest on confused reasoning. Morality may be extremely demanding, requiring significant sacrifice of personal projects and interests to promote the greater good.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most demanding utilitarian position against which moderate views define themselves. Essential for understanding the demandingness objection that shapes debates about charitable obligations. His rejection of options and constraints forces the question: if utilitarianism is true, can there be any principled limit to beneficence requirements?

  POSITION: Maximizing act-consequentialism. Represents the demanding pole of utilitarian views on aid obligations.

  title = {The Demands of Beneficence},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy introduces the "cooperative principle" to limit beneficence obligations: agents are required to do their fair share of promoting the good, where the fair share is determined by what would be required if everyone complied. This avoids both the over-demandingness of act-utilitarianism and the under-demandingness of views that make beneficence optional.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for the project's investigation of reasonable giving norms. Murphy's cooperative principle provides a principled way to set moderate thresholds (like 10% of income) that avoid extreme demands while maintaining moral seriousness. His framework directly addresses how to specify beneficence obligations in non-ideal conditions where not everyone complies.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism - a moderate position between maximizing consequentialism and views that treat beneficence as supererogatory.

  year = {2004},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity develops a sophisticated analysis of Singer's argument, identifying the Life-Saving Analogy as its key move. He argues that iterative reasoning creates apparently unlimited demands: each additional dollar saves lives, so there seems no principled stopping point short of destitution. Cullity defends moderate beneficence requirements by appealing to the intrinsic value of autonomy and the moral importance of being able to pursue one's own projects.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most thorough contemporary analysis of utilitarian beneficence arguments and their limits. Essential for understanding why income-based percentage norms (like 10%) might be justified against the iterative reasoning that suggests unlimited demands. Cullity's autonomy-based solution offers a framework for setting reasonable thresholds that respect both beneficence and personal integrity.

  POSITION: Moderate consequentialism tempered by autonomy considerations. Accepts strong beneficence obligations while rejecting extreme demandingness.

@book{scheffler1982rejection,
  author = {Scheffler, Samuel},
  title = {The Rejection of Consequentialism: A Philosophical Investigation of the Considerations Underlying Rival Moral Conceptions},
  year = {1982},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scheffler argues that consequentialism's impersonal standpoint fails to accommodate the personal point of view that gives individuals agent-centered prerogatives to pursue their own projects. He introduces a "hybrid" moral theory that combines consequentialist considerations with agent-centered permissions, allowing individuals to give disproportionate weight to their own interests without violating moral requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding agent-centered prerogatives that would limit beneficence obligations. Scheffler's hybrid theory provides a framework for moderate giving norms that don't demand full impartial maximization. His analysis helps explain why percentage-of-income norms might be morally acceptable even if they permit retaining wealth that could do more good elsewhere.

  POSITION: Hybrid consequentialism with agent-centered prerogatives. Represents a middle ground that accepts consequentialist considerations while rejecting maximizing requirements.

  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780195079760.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy extends his cooperative principle framework, distinguishing between ideal and nonideal moral theory. He argues that moral demands must be sensitive to actual compliance levels, not just what would be required under full compliance. This provides a systematic defense of moderate beneficence obligations that take seriously the fact that most people don't contribute their fair share.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding how to specify giving norms in real-world conditions where most affluent people don't donate significantly. Murphy's framework suggests that 10% income pledges might be justified as fair-share contributions even if full compliance would require less from each person. His nonideal theory approach directly addresses the project's concern with implementable norms rather than ideal requirements.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism applied to nonideal conditions. Defends moderate obligations sensitive to actual compliance patterns.

@incollection{macaskill2019definition,
  author = {MacAskill, William},
  title = {The Definition of Effective Altruism},
  booktitle = {Effective Altruism: Philosophical Issues},
  year = {2019},
  editor = {Greaves, Hilary and Pummer, Theron},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill defines effective altruism as using evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. He clarifies that EA is not identical to utilitarianism, though it shares utilitarian concern with consequences. EA adds an emphasis on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness that goes beyond traditional charitable giving.

  RELEVANCE: Represents contemporary development of utilitarian approaches to giving. MacAskill's work raises the question whether giving norms should specify not just how much to give (income vs. assets) but also how effectively (evidence-based charities). His defense of EA against the charge that it's "just utilitarianism" helps clarify the relationship between utilitarian foundations and practical giving guidance.

  POSITION: Effective altruism as a practical movement grounded in but not reducible to utilitarian ethics. Emphasizes evidence-based maximization of impact.

  title = {Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality},
  journal = {Ethics},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0199256578.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker defends rule-consequentialism: acts are right if they conform to rules whose general internalization would produce the best consequences. He argues this yields moderate beneficence requirements - internalization of demanding act-utilitarian principles would have worse consequences than moderate principles requiring reasonable but not extreme giving. Rule-consequentialism thus avoids demandingness while remaining consequentialist.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a utilitarian justification for moderate giving norms like percentage-of-income pledges. If Hooker is right, the best consequences come from internalizing moderate principles rather than maximizing ones. This could justify 10% income norms on utilitarian grounds even if individual acts of greater giving would produce more good. Relevant to whether asset-based norms might be better internalized than income-based ones.

  POSITION: Rule-consequentialism as a form of indirect utilitarianism. Supports moderate beneficence obligations on consequentialist grounds.

@book{unger1996living,
  author = {Unger, Peter},

  year = {1996},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0195108590.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Unger presents cases showing that psychological factors distort our moral judgments about aiding distant strangers. Through thought experiments, he argues that there's no morally relevant difference between failing to save a child drowning in front of you and failing to donate to effective charities that save children's lives. We have very strong obligations to donate most of our income to effective aid organizations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the demanding wing of utilitarian approaches to aid, similar to early Singer. Unger's psychological analysis is relevant to understanding why income-based norms might be more psychologically salient than asset-based ones, even if the latter are more rationally justified. His cases highlight how our intuitions about charitable obligations may be distorted by morally irrelevant factors.

  POSITION: Demanding consequentialism with emphasis on psychological biases in moral judgment.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780192849977.003.0002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Temkin argues for a pluralistic approach to aiding the needy that goes beyond the utilitarian "do the most good" framework favored by Singer and effective altruists. He contends that outcome-based, virtue-based, and deontological reasons all bear on our obligations to the needy, and that a purely utilitarian calculus fails to capture the full range of morally relevant considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides important critique of purely utilitarian approaches to charitable obligations. Relevant to the project's question of whether giving norms should be justified on utilitarian grounds alone or should incorporate other moral considerations. Temkin's pluralism suggests asset-based vs. income-based norms might be evaluated according to multiple moral criteria, not just marginal utility.

  POSITION: Moral pluralism rejecting single-principle utilitarianism. Accepts strong aid obligations but denies they can be fully captured by consequentialist reasoning.

  volume = {33},
  number = {2},
  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism (OOEA) for requiring impartial maximization that prevents helping those nearest to us. She proposes Mutual Aid as an alternative model that embraces partiality and community-building. Mutual Aid networks provide material support within geographical communities through empathy, solidarity, and care rather than impersonal effectiveness calculations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents radical critique of utilitarian approaches to giving that may be too demanding or too focused on distant strangers. Relevant to whether giving norms should permit or encourage partiality. The mutual aid framework raises questions about whether asset-based or income-based norms better support community solidarity vs. impartial effectiveness.

  POSITION: Critique of utilitarian impartiality from care ethics and solidarity perspectives. Rejects obligation-oriented effective altruism in favor of community-based mutual aid.

  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.54254/2753-7048/2025.ht24272},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Liu defends Singer's utilitarian argument for global charity obligations in the contemporary context of internet and social media. He argues that while Singer's framework has limitations (reliance on utilitarian principles, difficulties with relative poverty), it provides a valuable approach for addressing global suffering and promoting fairness in an interconnected world.

  RELEVANCE: Recent defense of Singerian utilitarian approach to charitable obligations. Discusses how technological changes affect both the moral urgency and practical implementation of giving norms. The analysis of "effective externalities" is relevant to considering how different giving norms (income vs. asset-based) might have different social effects in digital age.

  title = {Utilitarianism and Poverty},
  journal = {Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-poverty/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey surveys utilitarian approaches to poverty and aid obligations. He distinguishes between unconditional obligations to provide aid and conditional obligations to donate effectively (doing more rather than less good with given resources). The recent debate focuses on whether effectiveness requirements can be defended independently of demanding unconditional obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the structure of contemporary utilitarian debates about aid. The distinction between unconditional and conditional obligations is directly relevant to the project: an income-based or asset-based giving norm could be unconditional (you must give X), while effectiveness requirements could be conditional (given that you're giving, you should give effectively). This helps separate questions about how much to give from questions about how effectively.

  pages = {20--34},
  doi = {10.1080/16544951.2023.2246257},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal that most rich people should tithe (give 10% of income). He presents four objections based on demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustices. He proposes a principle of progressive giving based on wealth rather than income as better fitting the reasons EA theorists themselves provide.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the income-based vs. asset/wealth-based question central to this project. Aloyo argues that progressive wealth-based giving better captures concerns about fairness and need than flat percentage-of-income tithing. This is exactly the kind of argument the project needs to engage with: does utilitarian reasoning favor income-based or wealth/asset-based giving norms?

  POSITION: Effective altruism framework but with progressive wealth-based rather than income-based giving requirements.

  pages = {147--153},
  doi = {10.1080/17449626.2016.1191036},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Igneski responds to Singer's effective altruism arguments by questioning whether the maximizing framework adequately addresses what makes a life meaningful and ethical. She suggests that effective altruism's focus on quantifiable impact may miss important dimensions of moral value including relational obligations, virtues, and meaning-making.

  RELEVANCE: Raises questions about whether giving norms should be evaluated solely on utilitarian/consequentialist grounds or should account for broader considerations of meaningful life. Relevant to whether asset-based vs. income-based norms might differ in their effects on life-planning, security, and meaning - considerations that may not reduce to marginal utility calculations.

  volume = {27},
  pages = {305--328},
  doi = {10.1007/s10892-023-09428-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Williams defends rule utilitarianism by developing an account of what makes a rule "rationally acceptable" for internalization. He argues that rules must meet standards of both acceptability (people can reasonably accept them) and utility (their internalization produces good consequences). This provides a framework for determining which beneficence rules pass muster.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to evaluating whether income-based or asset-based giving norms would be better internalized. Williams's account suggests we should ask: which type of norm would people be more likely to rationally accept and successfully internalize? Income-based norms may have psychological advantages of simplicity and regular implementation, while asset-based norms may better track actual ability to give.

  POSITION: Rule-utilitarian framework for evaluating moral rules based on rational acceptability and consequences of internalization.

  title = {Bentham and Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Revue d'études benthamiennes},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.4000/129mo},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Koh argues that Bentham's utilitarianism is actually at odds with Effective Altruism's abstract use of numbers to calculate effectiveness. Bentham's view of pleasure as widely varied and inherently subjective resists the kind of quantitative cost-effectiveness analysis central to EA. This challenges the common assumption that EA is simply applied Benthamite utilitarianism.

  RELEVANCE: Raises important questions about whether different versions of utilitarianism support different approaches to charitable giving. If Koh is right that Bentham's utilitarianism resists EA-style quantification, this might affect whether utilitarian foundations favor income-based norms (easier to quantify) vs. asset-based norms (require more complex context-sensitive judgments).

  doi = {10.3817/0322198009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Malabou examines effective altruism as positioned between right-wing anarchism (libertarianism) and left-wing anarchism. She questions whether EA's "do the most good we can" project truly interrupts the logic of profit through non-reciprocal giving or actually reinforces it through moral calculation and utilitarian reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: Provides radical political critique of utilitarian approaches to giving. Raises questions about whether utilitarian giving norms (whether income or asset-based) can address structural injustice or merely provide individual moral solutions to systemic problems. The political economy critique may apply differently to income-based pledges (which leave wealth accumulation intact) vs. asset-based approaches (which could challenge wealth concentration).
