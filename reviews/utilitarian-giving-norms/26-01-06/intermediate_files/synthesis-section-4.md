## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals five significant gaps in the existing literature that the current research project addresses. These gaps collectively demonstrate that the dominance of income-based giving norms in utilitarian philanthropy represents an unexamined default rather than a principled choice.

### Gap 1: No Systematic Income-Asset Comparison in Utilitarian Giving Theory

Despite decades of sophisticated debate about the demandingness of utilitarian giving obligations, the literature has not systematically compared income-based and asset-based formulations. Singer's foundational argument (1972) discusses sacrifice in terms of what one "can afford" from ongoing resources, and this income-centric framing persists through effective altruism's operationalization in the Giving What We Can pledge, which commits members to donating at least 10% of income (MacAskill 2015). The demandingness literature similarly debates limits on sacrifice without specifying whether those limits should apply to income flows or wealth stocks: Murphy's cooperative principle (1993) could calculate fair shares from either base, and Cullity's life-shaping constraint (2004) addresses overall sacrifice levels without distinguishing the form wealth takes.

The sole exception is Aloyo (2023), who proposes progressive giving based on wealth rather than income. However, Aloyo's argument centers on fairness considerations—that wealth better captures historical advantages and net financial position—rather than on utilitarian optimization. No existing work directly asks which base would maximize welfare gains from giving under expected-utility assumptions. This gap matters because if income and assets have different marginal utility profiles, income-based norms may fail to maximize aggregate welfare improvement, making the choice of metric normatively significant rather than merely practical.

### Gap 2: Marginal Utility Literature Does Not Disaggregate Income from Wealth

Empirical research on diminishing marginal utility of money provides crucial foundations for utilitarian giving arguments, yet meta-analyses consistently estimate the "marginal utility of income" without distinguishing flows from stocks. Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell (2008) estimate an elasticity of approximately 1.26 using life satisfaction data, while Acland and Greenberg (2023) synthesize decades of studies to recommend 1.6 for policy applications—but both treat income and wealth interchangeably. The precautionary savings literature demonstrates that wealth serves distinct insurance functions (Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy 2013; Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar 2020), and the positional goods literature shows that wealth beyond security thresholds primarily affects relative status rather than absolute welfare (Ghosh and Wendner 2018; Freiman 2014). These strands suggest that wealth may exhibit steeper marginal utility decline than income once precautionary motives are satiated, but no study directly compares them.

This gap matters for the research project's central hypothesis: if assets beyond reasonable security thresholds have systematically lower marginal utility than equivalent income, then asset-based norms would generate greater welfare improvements per unit of donor sacrifice. The project addresses this by developing expected-utility models that incorporate the distinct functions of income (consumption) and wealth (insurance, optionality, status), deriving testable predictions about their differential utility profiles.

### Gap 3: Threshold Specification for Asset-Based Norms

Even those who accept that extreme wealth concentration is problematic have not specified at what level asset-based obligations should apply. Robeyns (2017) proposes limitarianism—upper bounds on permissible wealth holdings—but offers no threshold specification, leaving the proposal without clear action-guidance. Similarly, the precautionary savings literature establishes that wealth serves insurance purposes up to some adequacy level, but does not quantify this level for giving norm purposes. Effective altruism's 10% income pledge, by contrast, provides a concrete target, justified pragmatically as achievable and sustainable rather than theoretically derived (MacAskill 2015).

This gap reveals a practical asymmetry: income-based norms benefit from established percentage thresholds, while asset-based alternatives lack equivalent specification. The absence undermines the feasibility of asset-based approaches regardless of their theoretical superiority. The research project addresses this by proposing specific threshold criteria based on precautionary savings adequacy, drawing on household finance research to operationalize when the marginal utility argument for asset-based giving applies.

### Gap 4: Integration of Wealth Ethics and Utilitarian Giving Literature

Two substantial literatures—wealth ethics and utilitarian giving theory—address overlapping questions but remain poorly integrated. Wealth ethics examines taxation, inheritance, political equality, and intergenerational justice (Halliday 2018; Dietsch 2015; Volacu 2022), focusing on institutional redistribution. Utilitarian giving literature examines individual charitable obligations (Singer 1972; MacAskill 2019; Berkey 2021), focusing on personal donations. Cross-citation between these domains is limited, despite their common concern with resource distribution.

This separation matters because a stronger case for asset-based norms emerges from integrating multiple moral frameworks. Utilitarian marginal utility arguments suggest that wealth beyond security thresholds generates less welfare than equivalent income flows. Non-utilitarian considerations provide independent reinforcement: wealth transmission perpetuates inequality across generations (Halliday 2018), extreme wealth threatens political equality and democratic resilience (Volacu 2022), and mega-philanthropy depends on inequality that may itself be unjust (Wilson 2021). The research project synthesizes these strands, developing a pluralist case for asset-sensitive giving strategies that draws on both utilitarian and non-utilitarian considerations.

### Gap 5: Practical and Motivational Feasibility of Asset-Based Norms

Theoretical superiority is insufficient if norms cannot be implemented. Effective altruism's income-based norms succeeded partly due to psychological accessibility: income flows are regular, predictable, and integrate naturally into budgeting practices. Wilks, McCurdy, and Bloom (2023) characterize pledge-takers' psychological profiles but do not compare the appeal of income versus wealth-based commitments. Meanwhile, Harrington (2016) documents how sophisticated legal structures enable wealth to evade obligations through offshore mechanisms, suggesting that asset-based norms face distinctive enforcement challenges. Hooker (2000) emphasizes that optimal moral rules must be learnable and internalizable, raising questions about whether complex asset-based calculations would satisfy these constraints.

This gap highlights a potential practical objection: even if asset-based norms are theoretically superior, income-based norms may win on implementation grounds. The research project acknowledges these challenges and considers hybrid approaches—such as asset-triggered income pledges—that might capture the theoretical benefits of asset-sensitivity while maintaining the practical feasibility of income-based frameworks. Andreoni and Serra-Garcia (2021) show that pledges function partly through information revelation and screening, suggesting that alternative pledge structures might preserve these psychological mechanisms while better tracking actual ability to give.

### Synthesis

These five gaps reveal that income-based giving norms became dominant not through principled defense but through unexamined inheritance from Singer's original framing and pragmatic operationalization by effective altruism. The research project addresses this by providing the first systematic comparison of income versus asset bases under expected-utility assumptions, developing theoretical models that distinguish their marginal utility profiles, proposing concrete threshold criteria for when asset-based obligations apply, integrating utilitarian and non-utilitarian considerations, and seriously engaging practical feasibility constraints. Whether or not asset-based norms ultimately prove superior, the case for income-based dominance requires explicit justification it has not yet received.
