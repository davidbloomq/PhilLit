====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The effective altruism (EA) movement represents the contemporary mainstream
of utilitarian-inspired philanthropy, emphasizing evidence-based giving
to maximize impact. Central to EA is the Giving What We Can pledge, a
commitment to donate at least 10% of income to effective charities. The
movement emerged from Peter Singer's 1972 "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"
and was formalized through William MacAskill's work in the 2010s. Key debates
center on: (1) whether EA's focus on measurable impact neglects systemic
change, (2) the philosophical core of EA and its relationship to utilitarianism,
(3) the demandingness of utilitarian giving obligations, and (4) empirical
questions about what motivates sustained giving behavior. Recent critiques
question whether EA's income-based norms (like the 10% pledge) represent
optimal implementations of utilitarian principles or whether alternative
frameworks might better serve the movement's aims.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the "status quo" that the research project critiques.
Understanding EA's justifications for income-based giving norms—particularly
the 10% pledge—is essential for evaluating whether asset-based alternatives
might be more defensible on utilitarian grounds. The domain also reveals
gaps in EA literature regarding wealth versus income as giving bases.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
EA literature focuses almost exclusively on income-based giving with minimal
discussion of wealth or asset-based alternatives. Empirical research on
pledge-takers' characteristics exists, but little philosophical work examines
why income rather than wealth became the normative baseline. The movement's
practical focus on "earning to give" implicitly privileges income without
explicit normative defense.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare EA's implicit income-based framework with asset-based alternatives.
Note how EA literature emphasizes practical motivation and sustainability
(which may favor income-based norms) versus theoretical optimality. Consider
whether EA's origins in Singer's work predetermined income focus or whether
this represents an underexamined assumption.

KEY_POSITIONS:

- Institutional Critique: 4 papers - Systemic change vs. individual giving
- Pledge Psychology: 3 papers - Empirical studies of giving behavior and motivation

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. Applied to global poverty, this principle entails that affluent individuals have strong obligations to give substantially to famine relief, likely until giving more would cause comparable suffering. The argument challenges the distinction between duty and charity, proposing that preventing distant suffering is morally required, not supererogatory.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text establishing the moral case for substantial charitable giving that effective altruism builds upon. Singer's argument is income-focused—he discusses giving "until we reach the level of marginal utility" where our next dollar causes us as much suffering as it relieves. This income-centric framing may have shaped EA's default to income-based norms (like the 10% pledge) rather than wealth-based alternatives. The paper establishes the theoretical baseline against which the current project's asset-based proposal must be evaluated.

  POSITION: Foundational utilitarian argument for demanding obligations to give, focusing on income/consumption sacrifice rather than wealth redistribution.

  title = {Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference},
  publisher = {Gotham Books},
  address = {New York},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill popularizes effective altruism by arguing that we should use evidence and careful reasoning to determine how to benefit others as much as possible with our resources. He introduces the movement's core tenets: prioritization (focus on highest-impact causes), evidence-based evaluation of interventions, and "earning to give" (pursuing high-income careers to maximize donations). The book explicitly endorses the Giving What We Can 10% income pledge as a concrete standard.

  RELEVANCE: This is the key text establishing EA's contemporary norms and practices, including explicit endorsement of income-based giving standards. MacAskill frames "earning to give"—maximizing income to maximize donations—as a central EA strategy, implicitly privileging income over wealth as the relevant metric. The book never discusses asset-based giving or wealth taxes as alternatives, representing the income-centric default the current research questions. His defense of the 10% standard is primarily practical (sustainable, achievable) rather than theoretically optimal.

  POSITION: Mainstream EA defense of evidence-based, income-centric giving; practical rather than theoretically maximizing approach.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill articulates EA's philosophical core as using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. He distinguishes EA from mere consequentialism, arguing it's compatible with various moral theories. The definition emphasizes practical commitment alongside intellectual analysis, requiring both "figuring out" and "taking action." MacAskill clarifies common misconceptions: EA is not solely about poverty, not purely utilitarian, and doesn't ignore systemic change.

  RELEVANCE: This definitional work matters for the current project because it establishes what counts as within EA's scope. If EA is about maximizing benefit through evidence and reason, then examining whether income-based versus asset-based giving better serves this goal is central to EA philosophy. MacAskill's emphasis on practical action alongside theory suggests EA should be receptive to empirical arguments about giving metrics—yet the movement hasn't seriously considered wealth-based alternatives, representing a gap this research addresses.

  POSITION: Authoritative statement of EA's philosophical core, emphasizing flexibility and practical commitment.

@article{berkey2018institutional,

  title = {The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Utilitas},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {30},
  number = {2},
  pages = {143--171},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey examines the "institutional critique" of EA—the objection that EA's focus on direct interventions (like malaria nets) neglects more fundamental institutional and systemic changes. He argues this critique often misunderstands EA's actual commitments and that EA is compatible with supporting institutional change. However, he acknowledges EA faces epistemic challenges in evaluating systemic interventions due to their complexity and long-term nature, which may explain EA's practical focus on measurable, short-term interventions.

  RELEVANCE: This debate illuminates why EA might favor income-based giving norms over systemic alternatives like wealth redistribution policies. Income-based individual giving offers clear, measurable impact, while wealth-based alternatives might require political/institutional change harder to evaluate. However, this practical epistemic limitation shouldn't preclude examining whether wealth-based norms would theoretically better serve EA's goals. The paper suggests EA may have pragmatically defaulted to income-based approaches without fully examining alternatives.

  POSITION: Defense of EA against institutional critique while acknowledging epistemic challenges with systemic approaches.

  doi = {10.1111/josp.12347},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey identifies EA's philosophical core as requiring individuals to make significant contributions to benefiting others and to do so in ways that are optimific (or close to it) on empirically grounded assessments. He distinguishes this from stronger utilitarian commitments and argues EA is compatible with various moral theories. Berkey emphasizes that EA's practical guidance should be action-guiding for real people, not merely theoretically optimal, which may justify departures from pure utility maximization.

  RELEVANCE: Berkey's framework is crucial for evaluating income versus asset-based giving norms. If EA's core is "optimific giving based on empirical evidence," then the choice between income and wealth as the giving base should depend on which better serves this goal. His emphasis on "action-guiding for real people" might favor income-based norms if they're more psychologically sustainable—but this is an empirical question the current research can address. The paper reveals that EA's philosophical core doesn't inherently favor income over wealth; this choice needs independent justification.

  POSITION: Moderate EA position emphasizing empirical optimization and psychological sustainability over pure maximization.

  title = {Whether and Where to Give},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {44},
  number = {1},
  pages = {77--95},
  doi = {10.1111/papa.12065},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pummer argues that even if we lack obligations to donate to charity, we may still have strong moral reasons to donate to highly effective charities over less effective ones. He defends the "effectiveness condition": if you're going to donate, you should donate where you'll do the most good. This conditional approach sidesteps demandingness objections while maintaining EA's core insight about prioritizing impact. Pummer argues this holds even for those who reject consequentialism or demanding utilitarian obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Pummer's framework shifts the question from "how much to give" to "given that we give, how to give effectively." This is highly relevant for comparing income versus asset-based norms: even if neither is strictly obligatory, if we're implementing giving norms, we should choose the metric that maximizes impact. His conditional approach suggests the income vs. wealth question remains important even for those rejecting demanding obligations. The paper's silence on whether giving norms should be income or wealth-based represents a gap the current research addresses.

  POSITION: Moderate EA position using conditional obligations to avoid demandingness objections while preserving effectiveness requirements.

  volume = {34},
  number = {4},
  pages = {457--473},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.12176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically analyzes major critiques of EA, including: (1) it's too demanding, (2) it neglects justice and systemic change, (3) it's too focused on measurability, and (4) it's culturally imperialist. He argues many critiques misunderstand EA or conflate it with specific implementations. Gabriel distinguishes EA's "core commitments" (using reason and evidence to do good) from "common tendencies" (focus on global poverty, measurable interventions). He suggests EA can incorporate critics' valid concerns without abandoning its core.

  RELEVANCE: Gabriel's framework helps clarify which aspects of EA are essential versus contingent. If the 10% income pledge is a "common tendency" rather than "core commitment," then examining wealth-based alternatives is fully compatible with EA philosophy. His discussion of the "measurability bias" critique is relevant: EA might favor income-based giving partly because income flows are more easily measured than wealth stocks. This suggests EA's income focus may reflect epistemic convenience rather than normative superiority—a hypothesis the current research can test.

  POSITION: Sympathetic critical analysis distinguishing EA's essential commitments from contingent features.

  volume = {91},
  number = {5},
  pages = {1358--1373},
  doi = {10.1111/jopy.12842},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This empirical study (N=536) examines personality and cognitive traits of people who've taken the Giving What We Can 10% income pledge compared to matched controls. Pledgers score higher on moral expansiveness, actively open-minded thinking, utilitarianism subscales, and fear recognition. They're lower on social dominance orientation and maximizing tendency. Results suggest pledge-takers have distinct psychological profiles characterized by impartial moral concern and analytical thinking, but findings on empathy/compassion were inconclusive.

  RELEVANCE: This is the only major empirical study of people who've adopted EA's flagship income-based giving norm (the 10% pledge). The psychological profile identified may be important for predicting whether similar individuals would adopt alternative wealth-based norms. The study assumes income-based giving as the dependent variable without considering whether wealth-based commitments might appeal to similar or different psychological profiles. This represents a research gap: would these same personality traits predict wealth-based giving commitments? The current project should consider these psychological realities in evaluating alternative norms.

  POSITION: Empirical psychology of EA pledge-takers, revealing distinct cognitive and moral profile.

  year = {2023},
  volume = {16},
  number = {1},
  pages = {20--34},
  doi = {10.1080/16544951.2023.2246257},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal for income-based tithing (10% for most of the rich) on grounds of demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustice. He proposes a principle of progressive giving based on wealth rather than income: those with greater accumulated wealth should give proportionally more. Aloyo argues this better addresses fairness concerns (inherited vs. earned wealth), accounts for net financial position, and rectifies historical injustices. Progressive wealth-based giving fits EA's reasons better than flat income-based tithing.

  RELEVANCE: This is the only EA paper explicitly proposing wealth-based giving as an alternative to income-based norms. Aloyo's progressive wealth principle directly parallels the current project's inquiry into asset-based norms. His fairness arguments (wealth captures historical advantages better than income) and net worth arguments (focusing on income ignores assets/debts) provide philosophical support for wealth-based alternatives. However, Aloyo focuses on fairness/justice concerns rather than pure utilitarian optimization, leaving open whether wealth-based norms better maximize utility—the current project's central question.

  POSITION: Progressive wealth-based giving as a fairer, more just alternative to EA's income-based tithing proposal.

  pages = {701--718},
  doi = {10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee883},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lichtenberg analyzes EA's relationship to consequentialism, arguing that most EA understandings imply consequentialist commitments despite EA's self-description as theory-neutral. She distinguishes the view that we're obligated to maximize the good from the view that producing more good is always morally better, arguing the latter is essential to any consequentialist theory. Lichtenberg examines the demandingness objection and EA's clash with common-sense morality regarding personal projects and special relationships.

  RELEVANCE: Lichtenberg's analysis helps clarify what utilitarian commitments require regarding charitable giving. If consequentialism requires that "producing more good is always morally better," then the choice between income and wealth-based giving norms should depend on which produces more good—not on which is more convenient or intuitive. Her discussion of demandingness suggests both income and wealth-based norms face similar objections; neither framework inherently resolves the demandingness problem. The paper highlights that EA must ultimately appeal to consequentialist reasoning to justify any giving norm.

  doi = {10.5406/21520542.38.1.02},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chappell defends EA's core "beneficentric" ideas against recent backlash, arguing that wanting to effectively benefit others is excellent and widely neglected. He addresses common objections: EA isn't inherently utilitarian, doesn't require perfect impartiality, and is compatible with caring about systemic change. Chappell emphasizes that reasonable people can disagree on implementation details while sharing EA's basic values: helping others and doing so effectively matters morally.

  RELEVANCE: Chappell's defense of EA's "core ideas" as separable from specific implementations supports examining alternative giving norms. If EA's essence is "benefit others effectively using evidence," then the income versus wealth question is precisely the kind of implementation detail EA should investigate empirically. His emphasis on EA being "widely neglected" suggests there's value in expanding EA thinking to under-examined domains—like the choice of giving metrics. The paper's focus on defending EA against critics rather than examining internal alternatives represents a characteristic feature of EA literature.

  number = {1},
  pages = {106--115},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820818000158},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz reframes the institutional critique of EA by arguing it's best understood as claiming EA relies on an overly individualistic approach, neglecting collective obligations. He argues EA can incorporate attention to collective obligations while maintaining its focus on individual action. Dietz suggests EA is "incomplete" rather than mistaken—it captures important truths about individual obligations but needs to be supplemented with an account of collective action and institutional change.

  RELEVANCE: Dietz's framework is relevant for thinking about giving norms. Both individual income-based giving and collective wealth taxation represent ways of implementing beneficent obligations. If EA's incompleteness stems from excessive individualism, examining wealth-based alternatives requires considering both individual wealth-based giving and collective mechanisms (wealth taxes). The current project should assess whether moving from income to wealth as a giving base simply shifts between individual/collective frames or whether wealth-based approaches inherently require more collective action.

  number = {4},
  pages = {511--526},
  doi = {10.1017/S0892679416000484},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rubenstein critically examines EA's approach to global poverty from the perspective of political ethics and humanitarian practice. She identifies valuable lessons from EA (emphasis on evidence, outcomes, impartiality) but argues EA undervalues process-oriented concerns like participation, voice, and dignity. Rubenstein suggests effective humanitarianism requires balancing outcome maximization with respect for beneficiaries' agency and local knowledge. She questions whether EA's emphasis on measurability biases it toward interventions that can be easily quantified.

  RELEVANCE: Rubenstein's critique of EA's "measurability bias" is directly relevant to the income versus wealth question. Income flows are more readily measurable than wealth stocks, which may partly explain EA's income focus. If wealth-based norms would actually produce better outcomes but are harder to measure and monitor, EA might systematically undervalue them due to epistemic convenience. This suggests the current research should carefully examine not just the theoretical superiority of wealth-based norms but also their practical measurability and enforceability.

  volume = {52},
  number = {1},
  pages = {88--115},
  doi = {10.1086/706867},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lechterman argues that EA faces a fundamental political problem: its emphasis on impartial, consequentialist reasoning about giving conflicts with the partial, relational commitments essential to democratic citizenship. By treating all beneficiaries as equally deserving regardless of political relationship, EA potentially undermines the bonds of mutual obligation that sustain democratic communities. Lechterman doesn't reject EA but argues it needs to be reconciled with legitimate partiality toward fellow citizens.

  RELEVANCE: This political critique has implications for income versus wealth-based giving norms. If EA's political problem stems from excessive impartiality, wealth-based norms might face similar objections—they don't inherently solve the tension between impartial beneficence and democratic partiality. However, wealth taxation represents a collective, political mechanism that might better align with democratic values than individualized income-based giving. The current project should consider whether wealth-based approaches offer any advantages in addressing EA's political legitimacy.

  POSITION: EA's impartial consequentialism creates tensions with legitimate democratic partiality and political obligation.

  number = {2},
  pages = {167--199},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques "Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism" (OOEA)—the subset of EA viewing effectiveness-maximizing giving as morally obligatory. She argues OOEA's emphasis on helping distant strangers over local communities is intuitively wrong and undermines solidarity. As an alternative, Pearlman proposes Mutual Aid: community-based networks of reciprocal support emphasizing empathy, solidarity, and care rather than impartial cost-effectiveness. She argues we have no obligation to use funds "effectively" in EA's sense; rather, we have broader obligations to address suffering that Mutual Aid fulfills.

  RELEVANCE: Pearlman's critique targets EA's income-based framework but from a different angle than the current project. Where this project asks whether wealth-based norms would better serve utilitarian goals, Pearlman questions utilitarian/impartialist goals themselves. However, her critique is relevant because it highlights how EA's focus on individual monetary donations (whether income or wealth-based) may neglect alternative forms of beneficence (time, care, community-building). The current project should acknowledge that even optimally-designed wealth-based norms face these broader critiques of the charity framework itself.

  number = {2},
  pages = {201--226},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904083},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In contrast to Pearlman's rejection of EA, Mouser argues that mutual aid and EA are complementary rather than opposed. EA's strategy of donating to effective charities is politically short-sighted, keeping activists on a "firefighter's treadmill" of addressing symptoms. Mutual aid offers a superior long-term strategy for effective altruists: building power through solidarity to enable systemic change. Mouser argues mutual aid is more politically effective than individual charitable giving, thus better serving EA's ultimate goal of maximizing positive impact.

  RELEVANCE: Mouser's argument suggests EA's strategic approach (individual donations) rather than its goal (maximum positive impact) may be the problem. This has implications for income versus wealth-based norms: perhaps both frameworks are similarly limited because they focus on individual resource transfers rather than collective power-building. However, wealth taxation could represent a collective mechanism bridging individual wealth-based giving and systemic change. The current project should consider whether wealth-based approaches enable different types of political action than income-based ones.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines ethical questions in philanthropy from multiple perspectives, including consequentialist, deontological, and virtue-ethical approaches. Contributors address questions about: who should give, how much, to whom, and through what mechanisms. The volume predates EA's mainstream emergence but addresses foundational questions about philanthropic obligations that EA later popularized. Topics include the relationship between charity and justice, duties to distant strangers, and institutional versus individual approaches to beneficence.

  RELEVANCE: This volume represents pre-EA philosophical work on giving obligations, providing historical context for EA's innovations and gaps. The absence of sustained discussion about income versus wealth as giving bases in pre-EA philanthropy ethics suggests this wasn't a central question before EA—or that EA's income focus inherited an unexamined default. The volume's emphasis on "who should give" (identifying moral agents) rather than "from what resources" (income vs. wealth) reveals a lacuna that remains in contemporary EA literature.

  number = {10},
  pages = {6198--6210},
  doi = {10.1287/MNSC.2020.3811},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andreoni and Serra-Garcia investigate why revocable pledges (like the GWWC pledge) can effectively increase charitable giving despite being non-binding. Using theory and experiments, they show pledges serve as screening devices: people who pledge reveal information about their giving motives, allowing nonprofits to target interventions (like gratitude expressions) more effectively. This reduces reneging and increases overall giving. The value of pledges lies not in commitment power but in information revelation that enables better donor management.

  RELEVANCE: This economic analysis of pledge effectiveness is highly relevant for understanding EA's 10% income pledge. If pledges work through information revelation and screening rather than commitment, then the choice of pledge metric (income vs. wealth) might matter less than the pledge's ability to screen donors and enable effective follow-up. However, this assumes both income and wealth-based pledges would screen similarly—an empirical question. The paper's focus on pledge mechanisms without questioning the income basis reveals another gap: behavioral economics of pledges hasn't examined alternative giving metrics.

  number = {3},
  pages = {238--257},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820823000055},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Buchak examines how risk aversion and ambiguity aversion should affect charitable giving decisions under uncertainty. She argues that even if expected value theory is the correct decision theory, rational risk aversion provides reasons to diversify donations across organizations rather than giving everything to the seemingly most effective one. Similarly, ambiguity aversion justifies supporting proven interventions over uncertain high-upside possibilities. Buchak shows these attitudes can be rational and should inform EA giving strategies.

  RELEVANCE: Buchak's analysis of risk and uncertainty in giving decisions has implications for income versus wealth-based norms. Wealth stocks are less volatile than income flows, potentially making wealth-based giving more predictable for charities. However, implementing wealth-based norms might involve greater measurement uncertainty and political risk. The current project should consider how risk and ambiguity attitudes affect the comparative appeal of income versus wealth-based frameworks, both for donors (pledge-takers) and beneficiaries (charities).

  POSITION: Risk and ambiguity aversion rationally inform charitable giving strategies, justifying diversification and proven interventions.
