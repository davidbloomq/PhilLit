====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the distinctive moral questions raised by wealth
accumulation and asset holdings, as opposed to income flows. Central
debates concern whether there is a distinct ethics of wealth beyond
income ethics, whether asset holdings generate special obligations,
and how inheritance shapes intergenerational inequality. Key positions
include libertarian defenses of bequest rights, egalitarian critiques
emphasizing wealth's role in replicating inequality, and limitarian
views proposing upper bounds on permissible wealth. The literature
also engages with whether wealth concentration undermines democratic
equality and whether asset redistribution through taxation or other
means is normatively required.

Recent work has focused on the intersection of wealth inequality and
political power, the ethics of offshore wealth management, and whether
inheritance is morally distinctive from other transfers. Philosophers
have debated whether wealth's intergenerational transmission creates
special justice concerns beyond those arising from income inequality
alone, and whether holdings (stocks) versus flows require different
normative treatment.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether utilitarian giving obligations
should target income or assets. If wealth holdings generate distinct
obligations beyond those arising from income—due to inheritance effects,
concentration of economic power, or differential marginal utility—then
income-based giving norms may be inadequate. The literature provides
independent (non-utilitarian) grounds for treating assets differently,
which may either reinforce or complicate utilitarian prescriptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers explicitly compare income-based versus asset-based frameworks
for philanthropic obligation. Most work addresses taxation and state
redistribution rather than individual giving. Limited engagement with
how marginal utility considerations interact with non-utility reasons
for asset-focused redistribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish arguments from marginal utility (which
apply to both income and wealth) from arguments specific to wealth's
distinctive features (inheritance, political power, market structure).
Consider how non-utilitarian concerns about wealth concentration might
modify or complement utilitarian giving prescriptions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Inheritance skepticism: 6 papers - Wealth transfer perpetuates unjust inequality
- Limitarianism: 3 papers - Upper limits on permissible wealth holdings
- Libertarian bequest rights: 2 papers - Property rights extend to bequests
- Asset taxation: 4 papers - Wealth taxes as mechanism of redistribution
- Democratic equality: 3 papers - Wealth threatens political equality

@book{halliday2018inheritance,
  author = {Halliday, Daniel},
  title = {Inheritance of Wealth: Justice, Equality, and the Right to Bequeath},
  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198803355.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Halliday argues that inheritance is unjust to the extent
  that it enhances the intergenerational replication of inequality. While
  he acknowledges some bequest rights, he contends that unlimited inheritance
  concentrates wealth across generations and undermines fair equality of
  opportunity. The book examines whether inheritance is morally distinctive
  from other property uses and concludes that its intergenerational effects
  create special justice concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's focus on whether assets
  versus income generate different obligations. Halliday's analysis suggests
  that wealth holdings have distinctive normative features due to their
  intergenerational transmission—a dimension absent from income-based
  approaches. This provides non-utilitarian grounds for asset-focused
  philanthropy or redistribution, though Halliday emphasizes taxation
  over voluntary giving.

  POSITION: Represents the inheritance-skeptic position within egalitarian
  political philosophy, arguing for significant constraints on bequest
  rights to promote intergenerational justice.

@book{dietsch2015catching,
  author = {Dietsch, Peter},
  title = {Catching Capital: The Ethics of Tax Competition},
  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190251512.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietsch analyzes the ethical challenges of tax competition
  and capital mobility, arguing that individuals and corporations should pay
  tax in jurisdictions where they are members. He contends that strategic
  tax-setting by states should be limited and proposes an international tax
  organization to enforce principles of tax justice. The book defends these
  reforms against efficiency objections and argues they enhance rather than
  constrain sovereignty.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the institutional framework for wealth taxation and
  redistribution. Relevant to the project because it examines whether the
  globally mobile nature of wealth creates distinctive obligations. If
  capital flight undermines traditional redistributive mechanisms, this may
  affect whether income-based or asset-based giving norms are more feasible
  or enforceable. Dietsch's focus on membership-based tax obligations also
  bears on where giving obligations lie.

  POSITION: Represents cosmopolitan tax justice, emphasizing global cooperation
  to prevent wealth from escaping redistributive obligations through mobility.

@article{arneson2002justice,
  author = {Arneson, Richard J.},
  title = {Why Justice Requires Transfers to Offset Income and Wealth Inequalities},
  journal = {Social Philosophy and Policy},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {19},
  number = {1},
  pages = {172--200},
  doi = {10.1017/s0265052502191084},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arneson argues that justice requires transfers to offset
  both income and wealth inequalities, grounding this requirement in a
  responsibility-sensitive egalitarian framework. He contends that one's
  wealth and income determine what one can purchase from markets, and that
  fair equality of opportunity demands offsetting inequalities arising from
  circumstances beyond individual control. Both income flows and wealth
  stocks affect opportunity and should be subject to redistributive transfers.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the distinction between income and wealth
  from an egalitarian perspective. Arneson treats both as relevant to justice
  but does not fully develop how their different temporal structures (flow
  vs. stock) might generate different obligations. His framework supports
  the project's investigation by showing that both income and wealth matter
  for opportunity, leaving open whether they should be treated differently
  in giving norms.

  POSITION: Luck egalitarian approach that treats both income and wealth as
  morally relevant but does not clearly differentiate their normative status.

@book{harrington2016capital,
  author = {Harrington, Brooke},
  title = {Capital without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent},
  year = {2016},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Based on ethnographic research, Harrington examines how
  wealth managers help the ultra-wealthy avoid taxes, creditors, and legal
  obligations through offshore structures. She reveals the professional
  culture that enables massive wealth shielding while staying within legal
  boundaries, arguing that these practices erode government authority and
  exacerbate global inequality. The book demonstrates how elite capital
  mobility operates through specialized professional intermediaries.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals the practical mechanisms by which wealth escapes
  redistributive obligations, whether through taxation or voluntary giving.
  This empirical insight matters for the project because it shows that
  asset-based obligations face unique enforcement challenges compared to
  income-based ones. If wealth can more easily evade obligations through
  offshore structures, this may favor income-focused giving norms despite
  theoretical arguments for wealth-based approaches.

  POSITION: Critical perspective on wealth management industry as enabling
  inequality through legal arbitrage and professional expertise.

@article{robeyns2017wellbeing,
  author = {Robeyns, Ingrid},
  title = {Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice: The Capability Approach Re-Examined},
  journal = {Open Book Publishers},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.11647/obp.0130},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Robeyns develops the capability approach and introduces
  "limitarianism"—the view that there should be upper limits on how much
  wealth individuals may hold. She argues that extreme wealth concentration
  is unjust because it: (1) could meet urgent unmet needs elsewhere,
  (2) undermines political equality, and (3) reflects objectionable political
  processes. Limitarianism complements sufficientarianism by setting both
  floors and ceilings on distribution.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant because limitarianism specifically targets
  wealth holdings rather than income flows. This represents a clear case
  where assets (stocks) are thought to generate obligations distinct from
  those arising from income. If limitarianism is correct, then asset-based
  giving norms may be more appropriate than income-based ones for addressing
  excessive wealth concentration. However, Robeyns emphasizes institutional
  redistribution over individual giving.

  POSITION: Introduces limitarianism as a distinct position in distributive
  justice, focusing specifically on wealth ceilings rather than income limits.

@article{chan2025exploring,
  author = {Chan, Benedict S. B.},
  title = {Exploring Economic Equality through a Dialogue between Confucianism and Limitarianism},
  journal = {Journal of Global Ethics},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {228--236},
  doi = {10.1080/17449626.2025.2525104},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chan explores how Confucian ethics might support limitarian
  principles by presenting limitarianism as a pragmatic approach to economic
  equality consistent with Confucian ideals. He examines how both traditions
  relate to sufficientarianism and how cross-cultural dialogue can enrich
  understanding of wealth limits. The paper bridges Eastern and Western
  approaches to wealth concentration.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how non-Western ethical traditions may independently
  support wealth-focused (rather than income-focused) redistribution. This
  cross-cultural perspective strengthens the case that wealth holdings have
  distinctive moral significance beyond what utilitarian calculus alone would
  suggest. The dialogue with Confucianism may also illuminate alternative
  frameworks for individual giving obligations.

  POSITION: Cross-cultural ethical inquiry supporting wealth limits through
  Confucian-limitarian synthesis.

@article{penner2014intergenerational,
  author = {Penner, J.},
  title = {Intergenerational Justice and the ``Hereditary Principle''},
  journal = {The Law \& Ethics of Human Rights},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {195--217},
  doi = {10.1515/lehr-2014-0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Penner examines whether the "hereditary principle"—the
  idea that property can be transmitted across generations—is compatible
  with intergenerational justice. He analyzes the tension between bequest
  rights rooted in property theory and concerns about perpetuating inequality
  across generations. The paper considers whether limits on inheritance are
  required by justice to future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Connects inheritance to intergenerational justice concerns,
  showing how wealth transmission affects not only contemporaries but future
  persons. This temporal dimension distinguishes wealth from income and may
  generate distinct obligations. If current wealth concentration harms future
  generations' opportunities, this provides an additional reason (beyond
  marginal utility) for asset-based rather than income-based redistribution.

  POSITION: Explores tensions between property rights theory and intergenerational
  justice in the context of inheritance.

@article{cappelen2023wealth,
  author = {Cappelen, Cornelius and Pedersen, J\o rgen},
  title = {Just Wealth Transfer Taxation: Defending John Stuart Mill's Scheme},
  journal = {Economics and Philosophy},
  year = {2023},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors defend Mill's proposal for wealth transfer
  taxation: individuals should be free to bequeath but not to receive large
  bequests. They argue this scheme balances respect for testator autonomy
  with concern for equality of opportunity among the next generation. By
  taxing recipients rather than estates, Mill's approach addresses wealth
  concentration while preserving some bequest rights.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a philosophical defense of treating wealth transfers
  differently from ordinary income or consumption. The focus on recipient-side
  taxation reflects concern with how wealth holdings affect opportunity,
  distinct from concerns about income flows. This distinction is directly
  relevant to whether giving norms should target income or assets—Mill's
  scheme suggests assets deserve special treatment.

  POSITION: Mill-inspired approach balancing limited bequest rights with
  egalitarian concern for wealth concentration across generations.

@article{huemer2014wealth,
  author = {Huemer, Michael},
  title = {Is Wealth Redistribution a Rights Violation?},
  journal = {Libertarianism.org},
  year = {2014},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Huemer argues that taxation for redistributive purposes
  violates property rights, responding to claims that individuals lack
  ownership of pretax income. He defends the libertarian view that property
  rights extend to wealth holdings and that redistributive taxation—whether
  on income or wealth—constitutes rights violations. Huemer rejects the idea
  that justice requires offsetting wealth inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the opposing libertarian position that denies
  distinctive obligations arising from wealth holdings. From this view,
  neither income nor assets generate mandatory redistributive obligations,
  whether through taxation or giving. This position challenges the premise
  that wealth concentration per se creates justice concerns, though it allows
  for voluntary philanthropy. The debate with egalitarians like Arneson and
  Halliday frames the project's central question.

  POSITION: Libertarian defense of property rights against both income and
  wealth redistribution requirements.

  author = {Flanigan, Jessica and Freiman, Christopher},
  title = {Wealth Without Limits: In Defense of Billionaires},
  journal = {Philosophy and Public Issues},
  year = {2021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Flanigan and Freiman argue against proposals to limit
  extreme wealth through taxation, contending that such limits violate rights
  and harm economic productivity. They respond to Robeyns's limitarianism by
  defending the permissibility of unlimited wealth accumulation, arguing that
  the wealthy often create value for others and that limiting wealth would
  reduce overall prosperity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the counterargument to limitarianism and wealth-focused
  redistribution. If Flanigan and Freiman are correct that extreme wealth is
  permissible, this would undermine asset-based giving norms unless they can
  be justified on purely utilitarian grounds (marginal utility). However,
  their focus on value creation may still support voluntary giving by the
  wealthy without mandatory limits.

  POSITION: Libertarian defense of unlimited wealth accumulation against
  limitarian proposals for wealth ceilings.

@article{timmer2024intergenerational,
  author = {Timmer, Dick},
  title = {Intergenerational Justice and Freedom from Deprivation},
  journal = {Utilitas},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820824000049},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmer defends "semi-strong sufficientarianism" for
  intergenerational justice, arguing that freedom from deprivation in one
  generation lexically outweighs providing affluence in another generation,
  but deprivation does not always have lexical priority. He proposes both
  deprivation and affluence thresholds and examines how to balance
  distributive concerns across generations.

  RELEVANCE: Bears on the project because intergenerational wealth transfer
  affects how current assets translate into future opportunities. If
  preventing deprivation in future generations has priority, this may support
  wealth-based giving (which affects intergenerational transfers) over
  income-based giving. However, Timmer's framework applies to both income and
  wealth, leaving open which should be the primary target of redistribution.

  POSITION: Sufficientarian approach to intergenerational justice emphasizing
  deprivation thresholds across generations.

@article{volacu2022wealth,
  author = {Volacu, Alexandru},
  title = {Wealth, Political Inequality, and Resilience: Revisiting the Democratic Argument for Limitarianism},
  journal = {Journal of Politics},
  year = {2022},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Volacu examines the "democratic argument" for limitarianism—
  that excessive wealth damages democracy through political inequality. He
  questions whether the standard version of this argument succeeds and proposes
  a revised account focused on democratic resilience rather than simply
  political equality. The paper explores how wealth concentration undermines
  democratic institutions beyond its effects on formal political equality.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights a non-utilitarian reason why wealth (as opposed to
  income) might merit special normative treatment: its effects on political
  power and democratic governance. This consideration would not apply equally
  to income flows, suggesting that wealth holdings create distinctive
  obligations. However, this democratic concern primarily justifies
  institutional limits rather than individual giving obligations.

  POSITION: Refines the democratic case for limitarianism by focusing on
  resilience of democratic institutions rather than equality alone.

  year = {2019},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {597--619},
  doi = {10.1177/0042098019839875},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using London housing data, the authors demonstrate how
  international "wealth chains"—offshore investment vehicles and wealth
  management structures—anchor capital in luxury property markets. They argue
  these mechanisms shield wealth from taxation and regulation, converting
  housing from homes into assets for accumulation. This process benefits the
  wealthy while exacerbating inequality and housing scarcity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence of how wealth holdings operate
  differently from income flows: wealth uses sophisticated legal structures
  to escape obligations and reshape markets. This practical distinction
  between assets and income bears on the feasibility of different giving
  norms—asset-based approaches must contend with wealth's capacity for
  structural shielding. The housing focus also shows how wealth concentration
  has concrete effects on basic needs.

  journal = {Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {25},
  number = {2},
  pages = {211--234},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Delmotte and Cowen critique mark-to-market capital taxation
  proposals, arguing they face severe implementation challenges and may not
  advance distributive justice as effectively as alternatives. They propose
  broadening income tax bases (including imputed rent from housing wealth)
  rather than direct wealth taxes. The paper examines practical obstacles to
  taxing unrealized capital gains.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses practical distinctions between taxing income versus
  wealth, showing that wealth's illiquid and fluctuating nature creates
  valuation and enforcement problems. These practical differences may affect
  whether asset-based or income-based giving norms are more feasible, even if
  theory supports asset-focused approaches. The imputed rent proposal
  represents a hybrid approach bridging income and wealth taxation.

  POSITION: Pragmatic critique of wealth taxation emphasizing implementation
  challenges and proposing alternatives within income tax framework.

@article{braun2015liberty,
  author = {Braun, S. Stewart},
  title = {Liberty, Political Rights and Wealth Transfer Taxation},
  journal = {Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Braun examines libertarian arguments against wealth transfer
  taxation, analyzing whether political rights and liberty considerations
  preclude taxing inheritance and gifts. He critically assesses whether
  libertarian principles permit wealth transfer taxes despite opposition to
  income redistribution, exploring tensions in libertarian thought about
  different forms of taxation.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies whether the libertarian position treats wealth
  transfers differently from income, or whether both are equally protected by
  property rights. If libertarian theory does distinguish them, this supports
  the project's inquiry into whether assets deserve different normative
  treatment. The focus on political rights also connects to democratic
  concerns about wealth concentration.

  POSITION: Explores libertarian perspectives on whether wealth transfer
  taxation violates liberty differently than income taxation.

  year = {2016},
  volume = {1},
  number = {1},
  doi = {10.37706/ijaz.v1i1.7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Malik analyzes zakat—the Islamic mandatory charitable
  tax—as a mechanism for wealth redistribution and social justice. He argues
  that zakat targets accumulated wealth (assets) rather than just income,
  functioning to prevent excessive wealth concentration and promote economic
  growth. The paper examines how reinstitutionalizing zakat could reduce
  poverty and inequality in Muslim societies.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a non-Western religious framework that explicitly
  targets wealth holdings rather than income flows for redistributive
  obligations. Islamic zakat principles distinguish sharply between income
  and wealth in calculating obligations, offering a model for asset-based
  giving norms. This religious tradition's focus on wealth stocks rather than
  income flows parallels philosophical arguments for treating assets
  distinctively.

  POSITION: Islamic economic framework treating wealth accumulation as
  generating mandatory redistributive obligations through zakat.

  journal = {Global Health},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.1017/9781108692137.035},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Wilson examines the ethics of "philanthrocapitalism"—
  ultra-wealthy individuals applying business methods to large-scale
  philanthropy. He analyzes whether massive giving by billionaires (especially
  the Gates Foundation) should be celebrated or critiqued, arguing that such
  philanthropy is only possible under extreme wealth inequality. Wilson
  considers whether giving can be a duty or remains discretionary, and how to
  ethically assess large-scale private philanthropy's effects on global health.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether extreme wealth holdings create giving
  obligations versus being permissible if wealth is philanthropically deployed.
  The tension Wilson identifies—philanthropy depends on inequality that may
  itself be unjust—bears on whether asset-based giving norms can be justified
  independently of addressing wealth concentration through taxation. The global
  health focus also connects to utilitarian concerns about maximizing welfare.

  POSITION: Critical but balanced analysis of mega-philanthropy questioning
  whether private giving by the ultra-wealthy can substitute for just
  redistribution.

  title = {Against Paretianism: A Wealth Creation Approach to Business Ethics},
  journal = {Business Ethics Quarterly},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {32},
  pages = {475--501},
  doi = {10.1017/beq.2021.31},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young argues against using Pareto efficiency as the core
  ethical principle in business ethics, proposing instead that wealth creation
  should be the key evaluative standard. He contends that Pareto efficiency's
  static conception fails to capture ethically important dynamic efficiency
  considerations, and that focusing on wealth creation better justifies market
  activities and distinguishes ethical from unethical profit-seeking.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about distributive justice, Young's emphasis
  on wealth creation as an ethical standard bears on how we should evaluate
  wealth holdings. If wealth creation has independent ethical significance
  (beyond distribution), this might affect whether accumulated assets should
  be treated differently from income in giving norms. However, wealth creation
  arguments typically defend accumulation rather than redistribution.

  POSITION: Business ethics framework emphasizing wealth creation over
  distributive efficiency, potentially supporting productive wealth holdings.
