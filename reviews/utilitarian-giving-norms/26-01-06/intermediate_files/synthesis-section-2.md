## Utilitarian Giving Obligations and Their Limits

The utilitarian case for substantial charitable giving begins with a deceptively simple observation: the marginal utility of money declines as wealth increases. A dollar transferred from an affluent individual to someone living in extreme poverty produces far greater welfare gains for the recipient than welfare losses for the donor. Peter Singer's (1972) foundational argument draws out this implication with characteristic directness: if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Applied to global poverty, this principle seems to require giving until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to others---potentially until one approaches the living standard of those being aided.

This demanding conclusion has provoked decades of philosophical response, generating both defenses of strong beneficence obligations and principled frameworks for limiting them. Yet a striking feature of this literature has gone largely unremarked: these foundational arguments are framed almost exclusively in terms of income sacrifice---what one "can afford" to give from ongoing resources---rather than accumulated wealth. The demandingness debate constrains overall sacrifice but remains silent on whether income or assets should serve as the sacrifice base. This section examines utilitarian foundations for giving obligations, the major limiting principles that have emerged, and how contemporary practice has operationalized these theoretical commitments through income-based norms whose justification, we shall see, remains underexamined.

### Foundational Arguments for Utilitarian Giving

Singer's 1972 argument established the template for utilitarian approaches to charitable obligation. The argument proceeds from an uncontroversial premise about preventing bad things to a radical conclusion about our duties to distant strangers. Distance and the number of potential helpers are, Singer argues, morally irrelevant: that others could help but do not does not diminish our obligation. The demanding implication follows from utilitarian logic itself: we should give until marginal costs equal marginal benefits, which for the affluent means giving far more than conventional charity expects.

Shelly Kagan (1989) defends an uncompromising version of this view, arguing that common-sense limits on beneficence obligations lack adequate justification. What appears demanding from the personal point of view carries no independent moral weight against impartial considerations. Kagan represents the "bite the bullet" response to demandingness: if utilitarian principles generate extensive obligations, so much the worse for our comfortable assumptions about the limits of duty. Peter Unger (1996) reinforces this demanding position by revealing how psychological factors distort our moral judgments---the salience of the drowning child versus the statistical life saved by donation reflects morally irrelevant features of how cases present themselves.

More recently, effective altruism has channeled these utilitarian insights into practical guidance. William MacAskill (2015, 2019) articulates the movement's core commitment: using evidence and reason to determine how to benefit others as much as possible, then acting on that basis. While MacAskill distinguishes effective altruism from strict utilitarianism, the movement inherits the utilitarian focus on consequences and welfare maximization. Crucially for our purposes, MacAskill's practical guidance centers on income-based metrics---earning to give, the 10% income pledge---without explicit defense of income over wealth as the relevant sacrifice base.

### The Demandingness Problem and Limiting Principles

The demandingness objection cuts to the heart of utilitarian beneficence: if morality really requires giving to marginal utility equality, it demands too much. Various philosophers have developed principled responses that preserve meaningful obligations while avoiding extreme demands.

Liam Murphy's (1993, 2000) "cooperative principle" offers perhaps the most influential limiting framework. On Murphy's view, agents are required only to contribute their fair share toward achieving the best outcome, calculated on the assumption that others will also contribute their fair shares. Under full compliance, each individual's fair share would be modest; the apparent extremity of beneficence obligations arises from non-compliance by others. Murphy's principle provides resources for percentage-based norms: if fair shares can be calculated as percentages, then a 10% pledge represents not an arbitrary stopping point but a principled distribution of collective responsibility. Yet Murphy's framework does not specify whether fair shares should be calculated from income flows or wealth stocks---either could, in principle, serve as the base.

Samuel Scheffler (1982) introduces "agent-centered prerogatives" that permit individuals to give disproportionate weight to their own projects and commitments. The personal point of view has independent normative significance: agents may permissibly favor their own interests by some proportional amount relative to the impersonal good. This structure limits moral demands while preserving consequentialist foundations. However, Scheffler does not specify the size of the prerogative, leaving the quantitative threshold arbitrary. His framework better justifies qualitative limits---that some giving is required but not all---than precise percentages.

Garrett Cullity (2004) develops a distinct "life-shaping" constraint on beneficence. The problem with demanding principles, Cullity argues, is not merely their cost but their iterative structure: each act of beneficence creates circumstances calling for further beneficence, generating a regress that undermines autonomous life-projects. The solution lies in preserving agents' capacity for autonomous agency---beneficence must not expand to consume one's ability to shape one's own life. This constraint could ground percentage-based norms by defining the threshold at which giving begins to undermine life-projects, but notably, such thresholds would vary with individual circumstances, potentially favoring context-sensitive asset-based norms over uniform income-based ones.

Brian McElwee (2017) usefully distinguishes "cost-based" demandingness objections (morality requires too much sacrifice) from "directive force" objections (morality issues too many requirements). Even if a 10% income pledge is not too costly for affluent agents, the continuous obligation to give may create excessive directive force---morality governing too much of life. McElwee's analysis suggests that complete giving norms require both quantitative thresholds (how much) and qualitative limits (when obligation applies).

Rule consequentialism provides yet another route to moderate demands. Brad Hooker (2000) argues that the right acts are those required by the learnable set of rules whose internalization by the overwhelming majority would have the best consequences. The optimific code will include limited beneficence requirements because unlimited requirements would be unlearnable and would undermine agent motivation. Hooker's "learnability" and "internalizability" constraints suggest that simple percentage-based rules may be more likely part of the optimific code than complex formulas---a consideration potentially favoring income-based norms for their psychological accessibility.

### Contemporary Practice and the 10% Default

The effective altruism movement has operationalized utilitarian giving obligations through the Giving What We Can pledge: a commitment to donate at least 10% of income to effective charities. This norm has achieved remarkable success in mobilizing sustained giving, with empirical research revealing distinctive psychological profiles among pledge-takers. Matti Wilks and colleagues (2023) find that pledge-takers score higher on moral expansiveness, actively open-minded thinking, and utilitarian subscales compared to matched controls, suggesting the norm attracts those predisposed to impartial moral concern.

Brian Berkey (2021) identifies effective altruism's philosophical core as requiring individuals to make significant contributions to benefiting others in ways that are optimific (or close to it) on empirically grounded assessments. The emphasis on practical action alongside theory suggests that EA should be receptive to empirical arguments about giving metrics. Yet the movement has not seriously examined whether income-based norms best serve its own stated goals.

Theron Pummer (2016) develops a conditional approach that sidesteps demandingness objections: even if we lack unconditional obligations to give, we may have strong conditional obligations to give effectively when we do give. This framework shifts the question from "how much to give" to "given that we give, how to give most effectively." But the conditional approach leaves open which metric---income or assets---should govern the "how much" question for those who do accept giving obligations.

Eamon Aloyo (2023) provides the only sustained argument within EA discourse for wealth-based rather than income-based giving norms. He critiques the tithing proposal on grounds of demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustice, arguing that progressive wealth-based giving better captures concerns about inherited versus earned resources. Yet Aloyo's argument proceeds primarily from fairness considerations rather than utilitarian optimization, leaving open whether wealth-based norms would actually maximize welfare gains from giving.

The dominance of income-based norms in effective altruism appears to reflect pragmatic convenience rather than principled justification. Income is regular and predictable, easily integrated into budgeting and automatic transfers. The 10% standard echoes religious tithing traditions, lending psychological familiarity. These practical virtues may justify income-based norms on rule-consequentialist grounds if they promote sustainable giving behavior. However, they do not establish that income represents the theoretically optimal sacrifice base for utilitarian purposes.

What emerges from this survey is a substantial gap: utilitarian theory generates strong prima facie obligations to give, various limiting principles provide theoretical resources for moderate giving norms, and contemporary practice has settled on income-based percentages as the operative standard. But none of this literature directly examines whether income or assets should serve as the metric against which sacrifice is measured. The demandingness debate constrains how much we must give, but the choice of sacrifice base---whether we measure from flows or stocks---remains an unexamined assumption. If income and assets have systematically different marginal utility profiles, this assumption may not be normatively neutral.
