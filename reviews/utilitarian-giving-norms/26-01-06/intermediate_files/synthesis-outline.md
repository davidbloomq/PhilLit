# Literature Review Outline

**Research Project**: Utilitarian Giving Norms: Income-Based versus Asset-Based Obligations
**Date**: 2026-01-06
**Total Literature Base**: 123 papers across 7 domains

---

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the central tension between utilitarian theory and practical philanthropic norms, establishing why the income versus asset question has been neglected despite its theoretical importance.

**Content**:
- Utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to aid others in need (Singer 1972, Kagan 1989)
- Contemporary philanthropic movements, especially effective altruism, have operationalized these obligations through income-based pledges (e.g., Giving What We Can's 10% commitment)
- The dominance of income-based norms lacks explicit philosophical defense; it may reflect pragmatic convenience rather than principled justification
- Central question: Given that marginal utility theory applies differently to income flows versus asset stocks, should utilitarian giving norms be reformulated around assets?
- Scope: This review examines utilitarian foundations, the demandingness debate, marginal utility theory, contemporary philanthropic practice, wealth ethics, and timing considerations to identify gaps that asset-sensitive giving strategies might fill

**Key Papers**: Singer 1972, MacAskill 2015, Murphy 1993, Layard et al. 2008, Aloyo 2023
**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: Utilitarian Giving Obligations and Their Limits

**Section Purpose**: Establish the theoretical foundations that generate utilitarian giving obligations and examine how the demandingness debate shapes acceptable limits, setting up the question of how to operationalize these limits in practice.

**Main Claims**:
1. Utilitarian theory generates strong prima facie obligations to give, but the extent of these obligations remains contested between maximizing and moderate views
2. Various limiting principles (cooperative fairness, agent-relative prerogatives, satisficing) provide theoretical resources for non-extreme giving norms, but none specifies the metric (income vs. assets) that norms should employ

### Subsection 1.1: Foundational Arguments for Utilitarian Giving

**Papers**: Singer 1972, Kagan 1989, Unger 1996, MacAskill 2019
**Content**:
- Singer's argument from marginal utility: if we can prevent suffering without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so
- The demanding implication: give until marginal costs equal marginal benefits
- Recent developments through effective altruism: emphasis on evidence-based maximization of impact
- Note: These foundational arguments are income-centric in their framing (discussing what one "can afford" to give from ongoing resources rather than from accumulated wealth)

**Gap Connection**: Foundational arguments establish the obligation but do not specify whether income or assets are the appropriate base for calculating sacrifice

### Subsection 1.2: The Demandingness Problem and Limiting Principles

**Papers**: Murphy 1993, Murphy 2000, Scheffler 1982, Cullity 2004, McElwee 2017, Hooker 2000
**Content**:
- Murphy's cooperative principle: fair share based on what full compliance would require
- Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives: permission to weight personal projects
- Cullity's life-shaping constraint: beneficence must not consume autonomous agency
- Hooker's rule-consequentialism: internalizability constraints on demanding rules
- McElwee's taxonomy: distinguishing cost-based from directive-force demandingness

**Gap Connection**: These limiting principles constrain overall sacrifice but are silent on income versus assets as the sacrifice base; Murphy's "fair share" could be calculated from either

### Subsection 1.3: Contemporary Practice and the 10% Default

**Papers**: MacAskill 2015, Berkey 2021, Wilks et al. 2023, Pummer 2016
**Content**:
- Giving What We Can's 10% income pledge as the dominant operationalization
- Berkey's identification of EA's philosophical core: optimific giving based on empirical evidence
- Psychological characteristics of pledge-takers (Wilks et al.)
- Pummer's conditional approach: if giving, give effectively
- The practical emphasis on income as metric appears to be inherited default rather than principled choice

**Gap Connection**: EA literature has not examined whether income-based norms best serve the movement's own goals of maximizing impact

**Section Summary**: Utilitarian theory generates giving obligations that require limiting principles to avoid extreme demands. The demandingness literature provides theoretical resources for moderate norms, but existing practice (income-based pledges) lacks explicit justification for choosing income over assets as the sacrifice base.

## Section 2: The Case for Income-Asset Asymmetry

**Section Purpose**: Develop the central theoretical argument that income and assets have systematically different marginal utility profiles, providing potential grounds for asset-sensitive giving norms.

**Main Claims**:
1. Empirical research on marginal utility of money has not adequately distinguished income flows from wealth stocks
2. Assets serve distinctive functions (precautionary savings, optionality, positional status) that create thresholds beyond which marginal utility declines steeply
3. Non-utilitarian considerations from wealth ethics provide additional, independent reasons for treating assets differently from income

### Subsection 2.1: Marginal Utility of Income and Consumption

**Papers**: Layard et al. 2008, Evans 2005, Acland & Greenberg 2023, Gandelman & Hernandez-Murillo 2015
**Content**:
- Elasticity of marginal utility of income: meta-analytic consensus around 1.2-2.0
- Logarithmic utility as robust approximation across methodologies
- Critical limitation: these estimates treat income and wealth interchangeably, conflating flow and stock
- The project's hypothesis: disaggregating income from wealth would reveal different marginal utility profiles

**Gap Connection**: Existing marginal utility literature provides no direct income-versus-wealth comparison

### Subsection 2.2: The Distinctive Functions of Wealth

**Papers**: Crainich et al. 2013, Fuster et al. 2020, Ghosh & Wendner 2018, Freiman 2014
**Content**:
- Precautionary savings: wealth provides insurance against income shocks (Crainich et al. on prudence)
- Empirical evidence: low-wealth households exhibit high marginal propensity to consume; high-wealth households smooth consumption (Fuster et al.)
- Threshold effect: once adequate insurance is achieved, wealth's marginal utility falls steeply
- Positional characteristics: wealth beyond security thresholds primarily serves relative status (Ghosh & Wendner)
- Philosophical implications: prioritarians should care about positional goods' welfare effects (Freiman)

**Gap Connection**: If wealth's marginal utility declines more steeply than income's above security thresholds, asset-based norms may generate greater welfare improvements per unit sacrifice

### Subsection 2.3: Wealth Ethics and Non-Utilitarian Considerations

**Papers**: Halliday 2018, Robeyns 2017, Volacu 2022, Wilson 2021, Arneson 2002
**Content**:
- Inheritance and intergenerational justice: wealth transmission perpetuates inequality (Halliday)
- Limitarianism: upper bounds on permissible wealth holdings (Robeyns)
- Democratic concerns: extreme wealth threatens political equality (Volacu)
- Philanthrocapitalism tensions: mega-giving depends on inequality that may itself be unjust (Wilson)
- These non-utilitarian concerns provide independent reasons to treat accumulated assets differently from income flows

**Gap Connection**: The wealth ethics literature and utilitarian giving literature remain poorly integrated; combining them could strengthen the case for asset-based norms

### Subsection 2.4: The Temporal Dimension and Deferred Giving

**Papers**: MacAskill 2023, Broome 1994, Cordelli & Reich 2016, Harris 2021, Mogensen 2019
**Content**:
- The anti-discounting consensus: pure time preference is ethically indefensible (Broome, Parfit)
- Give-now versus give-later: MacAskill's parameter-based framework (investment returns, cause diminishing returns, existential risk)
- Intergenerational justice concerns about endowments and deferred giving (Cordelli & Reich)
- Patient philanthropy through mission-correlated assets (Harris)
- Connection to asset-based norms: if assets are held for deferred giving, timing considerations become relevant

**Gap Connection**: The interaction between asset-based norms and temporal donation strategies remains unexamined

**Section Summary**: Assets beyond reasonable security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than income, due to satiation of precautionary motives and positional character of excess wealth. Non-utilitarian considerations from wealth ethics reinforce this asymmetry. However, no existing work directly tests whether asset-based norms would outperform income-based norms under expected-utility assumptions.

**Word Target**: 1000-1200 words

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what is missing in the existing literature and how the research project addresses these gaps.

### Gap 1: No Systematic Income-Asset Comparison in Utilitarian Giving Theory

**Evidence**:
- Singer's foundational argument and EA literature frame giving in terms of income sacrifice
- Aloyo (2023) is the only paper proposing wealth-based alternatives, but focuses on fairness rather than utilitarian optimization
- The demandingness literature (Murphy, Cullity, Scheffler) debates limits on sacrifice without specifying whether limits should apply to income or asset sacrifice
- Domain 1 synthesis guidance notes: "Surprisingly little discussion of asset-based vs. income-based formulations"

**Why it matters**: If income and assets have different marginal utility profiles, income-based norms may not maximize welfare gains from giving; the choice of metric is not normatively neutral

**How research addresses it**: The project directly compares income-based and asset-based norms under expected-utility assumptions, providing the first systematic utilitarian analysis of this choice

**Supporting literature**: Murphy 1993, Cullity 2004, MacAskill 2015, Aloyo 2023

### Gap 2: Marginal Utility Literature Does Not Disaggregate Income from Wealth

**Evidence**:
- Meta-analyses (Layard et al. 2008, Acland & Greenberg 2023) estimate "marginal utility of income" without distinguishing flows from stocks
- Precautionary savings literature (Crainich et al., Fuster et al.) shows wealth serves distinct insurance function
- Positional goods literature (Ghosh & Wendner, Freiman) suggests wealth has strong positional components
- No study directly compares marginal utility of a dollar of income versus a dollar of assets

**Why it matters**: The research hypothesis depends on assets having steeper marginal utility decline than income; this requires empirical validation rather than theoretical assumption

**How research addresses it**: The project develops expected-utility models that incorporate the distinct functions of income (consumption) and assets (insurance, optionality, status), deriving testable predictions about their differential marginal utility

**Supporting literature**: Layard et al. 2008, Fuster et al. 2020, Ghosh & Wendner 2018

### Gap 3: Threshold Specification for Asset-Based Norms

**Evidence**:
- Robeyns (2017) proposes limitarianism without specifying thresholds
- The precautionary savings literature suggests thresholds exist but does not quantify them for giving norm purposes
- EA's 10% income norm is justified pragmatically (achievable, sustainable) rather than theoretically derived
- No work specifies at what asset level the marginal utility argument for asset-based giving "kicks in"

**Why it matters**: Practical implementation of asset-based norms requires identifying the threshold beyond which assets have lower marginal utility than income; vague proposals ("give from excess wealth") lack action-guidance

**How research addresses it**: The project proposes specific threshold criteria based on precautionary savings adequacy and begins to operationalize them for practical giving guidance

**Supporting literature**: Robeyns 2017, Fuster et al. 2020, Cullity 2004

### Gap 4: Integration of Wealth Ethics and Utilitarian Giving Literature

**Evidence**:
- Wealth ethics (Halliday, Dietsch, Robeyns) focuses on taxation and institutional redistribution
- Utilitarian giving literature (Singer, MacAskill, EA movement) focuses on individual charitable donations
- Limited cross-citation between these literatures
- The project's hypothesis could draw on both: utilitarian marginal utility arguments plus non-utilitarian wealth ethics concerns

**Why it matters**: Stronger case for asset-based norms emerges from integrating multiple moral frameworks; addressing only utilitarian considerations may understate the case

**How research addresses it**: The project synthesizes utilitarian marginal utility arguments with wealth ethics literature on inheritance, political equality, and intergenerational justice, developing a pluralist case for asset-sensitive giving strategies

**Supporting literature**: Halliday 2018, Volacu 2022, Arneson 2002, Temkin 2022

### Gap 5: Practical and Motivational Feasibility of Asset-Based Norms

**Evidence**:
- EA's income-based norms succeeded partly due to psychological accessibility (regular, predictable, integrated into budgeting)
- Wilks et al. (2023) characterize pledge-takers but don't compare income vs. wealth pledge appeal
- Harrington (2016) shows wealth can evade obligations through sophisticated legal structures
- No behavioral research on whether donors would adopt asset-based pledges

**Why it matters**: Even theoretically superior norms may fail if psychologically or practically infeasible; income norms may win on implementation grounds despite losing on theoretical grounds

**How research addresses it**: The project acknowledges implementation challenges and considers hybrid approaches (e.g., asset-triggered income pledges) that might capture theoretical benefits while maintaining practical feasibility

**Supporting literature**: Wilks et al. 2023, Harrington 2016, Andreoni & Serra-Garcia 2021, Hooker 2000

**Synthesis**: These gaps collectively reveal that the dominance of income-based giving norms in utilitarian philanthropy represents an unexamined default rather than a principled choice. The project addresses this by: (1) providing the first systematic comparison of income versus asset bases under expected-utility assumptions, (2) developing theoretical models distinguishing their marginal utility profiles, (3) proposing concrete threshold criteria, (4) integrating utilitarian and non-utilitarian considerations, and (5) considering practical feasibility constraints.

**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the key findings from the literature and position the research contribution.

**Content**:
- Summary: Utilitarian theory generates strong giving obligations, moderated by demandingness considerations, and operationalized primarily through income-based norms like the 10% pledge
- The income-based default lacks principled justification; existing literature provides resources for, but does not develop, asset-sensitive alternatives
- Key insight: Assets beyond security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than income, suggesting asset-based norms could generate greater welfare improvements
- The research project fills a clear gap by providing the first sustained analysis of whether income-based or asset-based norms better serve utilitarian goals
- Expected contributions: (1) theoretical framework comparing income and asset bases, (2) threshold specification for asset-based giving, (3) integration of utilitarian and wealth ethics perspectives, (4) practical guidance for reforming philanthropic norms
- Broader implications: If asset-based norms prove superior, this has significant implications for effective altruism and philanthropic practice more generally

**Tone**: Analytical and focused, building a case for the research project's contribution while fairly representing alternative views. The review should establish that income-based norms are the status quo while making the case that this status quo lacks principled defense and that asset-based alternatives merit serious investigation.

**Key Tensions to Address**:
1. Demandingness objections apply to both income and asset norms, but may apply differently
2. Practical feasibility may favor income norms even if theory favors asset norms
3. Non-utilitarian considerations (inheritance, democracy) could either reinforce or complicate the utilitarian case
4. Timing considerations (give now vs. later) interact with asset-holding in complex ways

**Critical Perspectives to Include**:
- Murphy's cooperative principle potentially limits both income and asset obligations
- Gabriel's institutional critique questions individual giving focus generally
- Schmidtz's libertarian objection to redistribution based on marginal utility
- Pearlman's mutual aid alternative to impartial utilitarian giving

**Objections to Research Hypothesis**:
1. Asset illiquidity creates distinctive costs (Hooker's dimensional demandingness)
2. Wealth can evade obligations through legal structures (Harrington)
3. Income norms may be more psychologically sustainable (internalizability, Hooker 2000)
4. Non-utilitarian property rights may protect assets more than income (libertarian view)
5. Contractualism may not differentiate income and assets (Hills 2010)

The synthesis should engage these objections while making the case that the research project addresses a genuine gap and merits sustained philosophical attention.
