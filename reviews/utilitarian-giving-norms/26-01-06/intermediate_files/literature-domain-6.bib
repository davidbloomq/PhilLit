====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the temporal dimension of philanthropic decision-making,
focusing on whether to donate now or invest for larger future donations. The
literature addresses three interconnected questions: (1) the normative status
of pure time preference in ethics and public policy, (2) the practical
parameters affecting "give now versus later" decisions (investment returns,
cause timing, future uncertainty), and (3) the ethical implications of
endowments and patient philanthropy strategies.

The debate over pure time preference has roots in foundational work by Broome,
Parfit, and others who argued that discounting future well-being merely
because it occurs in the future is ethically indefensible. Recent work
(Lowry & Peterson, Mogensen, Beard & Kaczmarek) has challenged this consensus,
arguing for circumstances where time preference may be rational or justified.
The climate economics literature (Stern, Groom et al.) demonstrates the
practical stakes of these debates through social discount rate controversies.

The "give now versus later" question has gained prominence through effective
altruism discussions. MacAskill's analysis identifies key parameters: expected
investment returns, the rate of diminishing marginal utility of money donated
to a cause, correlation between investment returns and cause importance, and
existential risk. Cordelli and Reich examine the intergenerational justice
implications of philanthropic timing, particularly regarding endowments that
defer giving to benefit future generations. Core and Donaldson introduce the
proximity preference framework for understanding charitable allocation across
both distance and time.

Recent work on impact investing (Harris) and venture philanthropy suggests
that the choice is not binary—patient investors may hold mission-correlated
assets that provide both financial returns and strategic value for future
giving opportunities.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether asset-based utilitarian giving norms
should incorporate deferred donation strategies. If utilitarian obligations
permit or require investing assets to maximize total donations over time, this
has implications for: (1) whether asset thresholds should trigger immediate
liquidation and donation, (2) how to weigh present need against potentially
larger future donations, and (3) whether patient philanthropy is consistent
with utilitarian urgency to reduce suffering.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature lacks direct engagement with how asset-based versus income-based
giving norms interact with temporal donation strategies. There is limited
empirical work on how actual donors navigate give-now-versus-later tradeoffs
across different wealth levels. The role of liquidity constraints and
consumption smoothing in optimal giving timing deserves more attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, distinguish between: (1) pure philosophical arguments about
time preference, (2) empirical parameters in climate/public economics that
inform social discount rates, (3) practical EA frameworks for individual donor
decisions, and (4) institutional questions about endowments and foundations.
The interaction between time-discounting and asset-versus-income norms may
reveal whether asset-based obligations create pressure toward deferred giving
that income-based norms avoid.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Anti-discounting consensus (Broome, Parfit, Rawls): 7 papers - Pure time
  preference is ethically indefensible; future well-being should not be
  discounted merely due to temporal location
- Qualified defense of time preference (Lowry & Peterson, Mogensen): 3 papers -
  Some forms of time preference may be rational or justified by partiality
- Give-now advocates: 3 papers - Uncertainty, urgency, and risk of value drift
  favor immediate giving
- Patient philanthropy: 5 papers - Investment, strategic timing, and
  mission-correlated assets can justify deferred giving

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Broome argues that discounting future benefits in
  cost-benefit analysis is not justified by pure time preference—the view that
  a benefit is less valuable merely because it occurs in the future. He
  distinguishes between discounting for diminishing marginal utility and
  discounting for uncertainty, which may be legitimate, and pure time
  preference, which he argues is ethically arbitrary. The paper provides a
  philosophical foundation for debates about the social discount rate in
  climate economics and intergenerational justice.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper establishes the anti-discounting position
  that is central to debates about deferred giving. If pure time preference is
  ethically indefensible, then utilitarian obligations to give cannot be
  weakened simply because donations would occur in the future. This has direct
  implications for whether investing to give later can be justified on
  utilitarian grounds—it must be defended by appeal to investment returns or
  strategic timing, not by discounting future beneficiaries' interests.

  POSITION: Represents the anti-discounting consensus in ethics; influential
  in debates about climate policy and intergenerational obligations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cordelli and Reich examine the intergenerational justice
  implications of philanthropic endowments—institutional structures that defer
  giving to benefit future generations. They argue that endowments raise
  questions about whether current donors have obligations to address present
  needs versus investing for future impact, and whether elite control of
  intergenerational resource allocation is democratically legitimate. The
  chapter distinguishes between individual deferred giving and institutional
  perpetuity.

  RELEVANCE: This work directly addresses the temporal dimension of giving
  norms. The tension they identify between present obligation and future impact
  is central to evaluating whether asset-based utilitarian norms should permit
  or require investment strategies. Their democratic concerns about endowments
  may extend to individual patient philanthropy if wealthy donors defer giving
  based on speculative assessments of future value.

  POSITION: Critical perspective on patient philanthropy through endowments;
  emphasizes democratic accountability and present obligations.

  doi = {10.1515/9780691184395-007},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reich extends his analysis of philanthropy's temporal
  dimension, arguing that perpetual endowments represent a problematic
  extension of donor control across generations. He contends that while
  individuals may permissibly defer giving through investment, institutional
  structures that lock in donor intent indefinitely raise democratic legitimacy
  concerns. The chapter examines alternative models including sunset
  provisions and mission flexibility.

  RELEVANCE: Reich's work helps distinguish between individual deferred giving
  decisions (which may be justified by strategic considerations) and
  institutional perpetuity (which raises governance concerns). For asset-based
  utilitarian norms, this suggests that while investing to give later may be
  permissible for individuals, creating permanent structures that defer giving
  across generations may be more problematic.

  POSITION: Democratic critique of perpetual philanthropy; accepts some forms
  of temporal discretion for donors while questioning intergenerational lock-in.

@incollection{macaskill2023when,
  author = {MacAskill, William},
  title = {When Should an Effective Altruist Donate?},
  booktitle = {Giving in Time},
  editor = {Madoff, Ray and Soskis, Benjamin},
  year = {2023},
  publisher = {The Rowman \& Littlefield Publishing Group},
  doi = {10.5040/9798216424963.ch7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill provides a framework for the "give now versus give
  later" decision within effective altruism. He identifies four key parameters:
  (1) expected investment returns, (2) the rate of diminishing marginal utility
  of money donated to a cause (which reflects both funding growth and solved
  problems), (3) correlation between investment returns and cause importance,
  and (4) existential risk. He argues that for many causes with rapidly
  diminishing returns to funding, giving now is likely optimal, but patient
  philanthropy may be justified for emerging or speculative causes.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most direct analysis of deferred giving within the
  utilitarian framework most relevant to the project. MacAskill's framework
  reveals that the give-now-versus-later decision depends on empirical
  parameters, not just pure time preference. For asset-based giving norms,
  this suggests that optimal timing may vary by cause area and individual
  circumstances, rather than supporting a uniform immediate-liquidation rule.

  POSITION: Pragmatic effective altruism position; emphasizes empirical
  parameters over philosophical arguments about time preference.

  volume = {65},
  number = {260},
  pages = {437--454},
  doi = {10.1093/pq/pqu085},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lowry and Peterson challenge the anti-discounting consensus
  established by Sidgwick, Ramsey, Rawls, and Parfit. They argue that pure
  time preference—preferring something merely because of when it occurs—is not
  always irrational. They defend limited time preference on grounds including
  personal projects, uncertainty about future preferences, and the
  phenomenology of temporal experience. Their defense is qualified and does not
  extend to all contexts.

  RELEVANCE: This paper challenges the philosophical foundation for the view
  that deferred giving cannot be justified by time preference alone. If some
  forms of time preference are rational, this potentially opens space for
  donors to weight present donations more heavily than the anti-discounting
  view permits. However, their qualified defense may not extend to
  intergenerational contexts relevant to philanthropy.

  POSITION: Qualified defense of pure time preference; challenges
  anti-discounting consensus while acknowledging contextual limits.

@article{mogensen2019only,

  journal = {Utilitas},

  volume = {31},
  number = {4},
  pages = {449--468},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820819000062},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mogensen examines whether "discounting for kinship"—giving
  greater weight to nearer generations due to agent-relative reasons of
  partiality—can justify a positive rate of pure intergenerational time
  preference. He responds to Parfit's objections and argues that partiality
  between generations may provide the only plausible ethical argument for
  discounting future well-being. He remains skeptical that this argument
  succeeds but treats it as the strongest case for time preference.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explores whether agent-relative reasons could justify
  preferring present over future beneficiaries in philanthropic contexts. For
  asset-based giving norms, this raises the question of whether donors have
  stronger obligations to present versus future recipients, potentially
  supporting immediate giving over investment strategies even when expected
  returns favor delay.

  POSITION: Sympathetic exploration of the strongest case for time preference
  via partiality; maintains skepticism about whether the argument succeeds.

  journal = {Utilitas},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {35},
  number = {3},
  pages = {215--234},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820823000109},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beard and Kaczmarek argue that in the context of existential
  risk and vast future populations, some degree of pure time preference may be
  reasonable. They identify three considerations: the asymmetry of causal
  influence (we can only affect the future), the distribution of benefits from
  using spacetime as a resource, and the burdens of care given the former two.
  Surprisingly, they find that time preference may not weaken the case for
  existential risk mitigation as commonly assumed.

  RELEVANCE: This recent work challenges assumptions about how time preference
  affects long-term cause prioritization. For asset-based giving norms, it
  suggests that even if some time preference is justified, this may not
  necessarily favor present over future donations in all cause areas—
  particularly those related to existential risk or long-term trajectories.

  POSITION: Novel argument for limited time preference compatible with
  longtermist priorities; challenges conventional wisdom about time preference
  and existential risk.

  number = {3},
  pages = {261--284},
  doi = {10.1080/00346760903480517},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Core and Donaldson develop a framework for understanding
  charitable allocation decisions across both physical distance and temporal
  distance. They introduce the concept of "proximity preference"—the tendency
  to favor recipients who are closer in space, psychic identity, or time. They
  examine how US donors allocate between present and future beneficiaries,
  particularly through endowments serving wealthy versus needy populations, and
  argue that while donor preferences matter, recipient need should be the
  dominant factor.

  RELEVANCE: This paper explicitly connects spatial and temporal dimensions of
  giving, providing a framework for understanding how proximity preferences
  might affect asset-based versus income-based norms. If donors exhibit
  temporal proximity preference, this could favor immediate giving over
  investment strategies, independent of economic or strategic considerations.
  The paper's normative stance prioritizing need over proximity supports
  focusing on cause effectiveness rather than timing per se.

  POSITION: Economic and ethical analysis emphasizing need over proximity
  preferences; critical of endowments favoring wealthy future recipients.

  pages = {467--491},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-resource-111920-020721},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Groom et al. provide a comprehensive review of the academic
  literature on long-term social discount rates, emphasizing how small changes
  in the discount rate have enormous effects on the evaluation of projects with
  long time horizons (climate mitigation, infrastructure, etc.). They examine
  the integration of academic insights into governmental guidance and find
  substantial variation across countries. The review emphasizes the importance
  of declining discount rates for distant-future outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on public policy rather than individual
  philanthropy, this review illuminates the parameters affecting time-dependent
  decisions. The sensitivity of long-term project value to discount rates has
  parallels in give-now-versus-later decisions for individual donors. The
  review's discussion of declining discount rates may be relevant to
  multi-generational philanthropic planning.

  volume = {15},
  pages = {93--113},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-financial-101822-112948},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Caplin and Leahy analyze how market interest rates may not
  reflect population-wide discount rates when some market participants are
  missing—either current participants (like constrained borrowers) or future
  participants (future generations). They argue that missing current
  participants implies average discount rates above market rates, while missing
  future participants implies rates below market rates. They examine
  implications for social discount rate policy, including the role of legacy
  preferences and intergenerational altruism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a sophisticated analysis of how discount rates
  should account for participants absent from current markets, including future
  beneficiaries of philanthropy. For asset-based giving norms, this suggests
  that market returns alone may not determine optimal giving timing—altruistic
  donors must consider that future beneficiaries cannot currently "bid" for
  resources. The legacy utility discussion may be relevant to motivations for
  deferred giving.

  missing markets and intergenerational transfers.

@article{harris2021investing,

  title = {Investing for Impact in General Equilibrium},
  journal = {SSRN Working Paper},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3939991},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harris develops a general equilibrium model combining
  investment, production, and non-pecuniary impact considerations. He shows
  that investors with high urgency make substantial allocations to pure
  philanthropy, while more patient investors tilt toward mission-correlated
  assets—investments whose financial returns correlate with positive
  developments in their impact opportunity set. The model demonstrates that
  "investing for impact" does not mean pure impact investing but rather
  strategic portfolio construction considering impact returns alongside
  financial returns.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges the give-now-versus-later decision with
  portfolio construction for impact-motivated investors. It suggests that the
  choice is not binary between immediate donation and standard investment, but
  includes intermediate strategies of holding mission-correlated assets. For
  asset-based giving norms, this implies that optimal asset management may
  differ from both immediate liquidation and wealth maximization, depending on
  the correlation between investment returns and cause trajectories.

  POSITION: Financial economics model of impact investing; emphasizes patient
  philanthropy through strategic asset allocation rather than immediate giving.

  volume = {4},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--22},
  doi = {10.1086/688584},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Asheim and Nesje demonstrate a paradoxical result: in a
  two-sector growth model with negative atmospheric externalities (like climate
  change), increased intergenerational altruism can undermine long-term
  well-being. Each dynasty's attempt to help future generations through
  increased altruism leads to behaviors that collectively worsen outcomes. This
  contrasts with standard one-sector models where sufficient altruism
  guarantees good outcomes. The result highlights the importance of collective
  action rather than individual altruism alone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals limits of individual altruism in addressing
  problems requiring collective action. For asset-based giving norms, it
  suggests that individual optimization of giving timing may be insufficient—
  what matters is the collective effect of individual strategies. The result
  cautions against inferring that more patient (future-oriented) individual
  giving necessarily improves long-term outcomes.

  year = {2007},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511817434},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The Stern Review famously argued for urgent climate action
  based on a near-zero pure rate of time preference and low elasticity of
  marginal utility. Stern's choice of a 0.1% pure time preference rate (to
  account only for extinction risk) led to much higher valuations of
  distant-future climate damages than alternative discount rate approaches. The
  review sparked intense debate about the appropriate discount rate for
  intergenerational cost-benefit analysis.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on climate policy, the Stern Review demonstrates the
  enormous practical stakes of time preference debates. The controversy over
  Stern's discount rate choice illustrates the tension between ethical
  arguments against discounting and economic modeling conventions. For
  philanthropic timing, it shows how different time preference assumptions lead
  to radically different conclusions about present versus future resource
  allocation.

  pages = {272--291},
  doi = {10.1080/1350178X.2017.1356057},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kelleher examines the role of pure time preference in
  intertemporal welfare economics, analyzing debates between economists who
  accept positive time preference and philosophers who reject it. He argues
  that the disagreement partly reflects different methodological commitments:
  economists often treat time preference as a descriptive parameter of actual
  preferences, while philosophers treat it as a normative question about
  rational or ethical evaluation. Kelleher defends the economists' approach in
  certain contexts while acknowledging the force of philosophical objections.

  RELEVANCE: This paper helps clarify what is at stake in time preference
  debates for philanthropic timing decisions. It distinguishes between
  describing actual donor preferences (which may exhibit time preference) and
  prescribing what utilitarian obligations require (which may exclude pure time
  preference). For asset-based giving norms, this suggests the question is not
  just what donors prefer but what they ought to prefer from a utilitarian
  standpoint.

  qualified role for time preference in positive economics while acknowledging

  pages = {47--82},
  doi = {10.1093/aristotelian/84.1.47},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Parfit argues that bias toward the near—preferring benefits
  merely because they are temporally nearer—is rationally indefensible,
  analogous to preferring one's future Tuesday-self over one's future
  Wednesday-self. He distinguishes this from the rational preference for
  earlier over later painful experiences (due to relief) and argues that the
  former is a cognitive bias we should reject. This argument extends to the
  intergenerational case, suggesting that temporal location alone cannot
  justify differential concern.

  RELEVANCE: Parfit's argument against pure time preference provides the
  philosophical foundation for much of the anti-discounting position in
  philanthropy timing debates. If his argument succeeds, then giving now cannot
  be justified merely because present needs are temporally nearer—it must be
  defended on grounds of urgency, uncertainty, or strategic considerations. For
  asset-based norms, this supports evaluating investment strategies on
  consequentialist grounds rather than temporal proximity.

  foundational for anti-discounting view.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This blog post explains "hits-based giving," an approach
  borrowed from venture capital where donors make multiple high-risk,
  high-reward donations expecting most to fail but some to succeed dramatically.
  The post argues that this approach, advocated by Open Philanthropy, may be
  particularly appropriate for speculative causes or emerging issues where
  conventional charity evaluation is difficult. It discusses how to implement
  hits-based strategies through diversification and expected value reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: Hits-based giving represents an alternative to both immediate
  giving to proven interventions and patient philanthropy through investment.
  It suggests a third path: immediate deployment to high-variance opportunities.
  For asset-based giving norms, this raises the question of whether large asset
  holders should liquidate and deploy to hits-based portfolios rather than
  either holding assets or giving to proven charities. The approach emphasizes
  active grant-making rather than passive investment.

  POSITION: Effective altruism approach to high-risk, high-reward giving;
  emphasizes active deployment over patient investment.

  number = {1},
  pages = {89--112},
  doi = {10.1515/MOPP-2018-0060},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mintz-Woo defends utility discounting based on risk rather
  than pure time preference. He argues that when future utility faces
  model-independent risk (outcomes that won't materialize due to unpredictable
  events), rational discounting is justified. He distinguishes this "probability
  discounting" from pure time preference and responds to objections from Parfit
  and Broome. The resulting discount rates are typically lower than descriptive
  rates but positive.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a middle ground between zero discounting and
  conventional rates based on pure time preference. For philanthropic timing,
  it suggests that some discounting of future donations may be justified not
  because they occur later but because of genuine uncertainty about whether
  they will occur (donor death, value drift, societal disruption). This could
  favor give-now strategies without requiring pure time preference.

  POSITION: Defense of limited discounting based on risk rather than pure time
  preference; responds to anti-discounting arguments.
