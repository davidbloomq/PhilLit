====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The demandingness objection is one of the most persistent challenges to consequentialist and utilitarian moral theories. The debate centers on whether morality can reasonably demand that agents give to the point of marginal utility equality, as Singer's famous 1972 argument suggests, or whether there must be principled limits on moral obligation. Three main response strategies have emerged: (1) agent-relative prerogatives that permit agents to give special weight to their own projects and commitments (Scheffler 1982); (2) satisficing approaches that require only "good enough" rather than optimal outcomes (Slote, Pettit); and (3) threshold or cooperative principles that distribute obligations fairly across agents (Murphy 1993, 2000). Recent work has explored institutional responses (Miklos & Tanyi 2020), scalar approaches that dispense with obligation-talk altogether (Norcross 2020), and refined accounts of what counts as "demanding" (McElwee 2017, York 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central tension in utilitarian giving norms: whether income-based pledges (e.g., 10%) represent arbitrary stopping points or defensible thresholds. Murphy's cooperative principle provides a theoretical foundation for percentage-based norms, while satisficing and threshold views explain why agents need not give to the point of marginal utility equality. The demandingness debate reveals how utilitarian theory must accommodate practical constraints while maintaining moral force.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively debates theoretical foundations for limiting demands, there is surprisingly little work comparing specific mechanisms (income-based vs. asset-based thresholds, percentage bands, time-limited pledges). The connection between demandingness theory and practical charitable giving movements (Giving What We Can, effective altruism) remains underdeveloped, despite Singer's explicit move toward 10% recommendations in later work.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay special attention to the evolution of Singer's position from the demanding 1972 principle to the more pragmatic 10% recommendation in later work. Note how Murphy's cooperative principle provides the most direct theoretical justification for percentage-based norms. Consider whether satisficing and threshold approaches are ultimately compatible or represent distinct theoretical commitments.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Agent-relative prerogatives (Scheffler, Portmore, Lazar): 7 papers - Permits weighting own projects/commitments
- Satisficing consequentialism (Slote, Pettit, Bradley, McKay): 5 papers - Requires only "good enough" outcomes
- Cooperative/threshold principles (Murphy, Cullity, Hurka): 4 papers - Distributes obligations fairly across agents
- Scalar consequentialism (Norcross, McElwee): 2 papers - Dispenses with deontic categories altogether

@article{singer1972famine,
  author = {Singer, Peter},
  title = {Famine, Affluence, and Morality},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},

  volume = {1},

  pages = {229--243},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Applied to global poverty, this principle requires affluent individuals to donate to famine relief until they reach the level at which giving more would cause as much suffering to themselves as they would prevent. Distance and number of potential givers are morally irrelevant.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational paper establishing the demandingness problem for utilitarian giving obligations. Singer's principle implies giving far beyond conventional charity - potentially until marginal utility equality. His later retreat to a 10% recommendation (in "The Life You Can Save") marks a crucial shift relevant to whether income-based thresholds can be principled rather than merely pragmatic compromises.

  POSITION: Maximizing act-utilitarianism applied to beneficence; represents the most demanding position in the debate, though Singer later moderates it.

  year = {1989},
  doi = {10.1093/0198239165.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kagan defends an uncompromising consequentialism against common-sense morality, arguing that ordinary morality's limits on moral demands (agent-relative prerogatives, constraints against harming) lack adequate justification. Contra Scheffler, he contends that the personal point of view cannot justify permissions to do less than maximize the good. The demandingness objection fails because it simply asserts, rather than justifies, the legitimacy of personal concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Kagan represents the "bite the bullet" response to demandingness: accepting that morality really does demand sacrifices that ordinary morality deems supererogatory. This position sets the standard against which moderate responses (satisficing, thresholds, prerogatives) must be measured. For income vs. asset-based norms, Kagan's view implies neither is privileged - both are mere stopping points unless they maximize utility.

  POSITION: Maximizing consequentialism; rejects agent-relative prerogatives and defends extreme demands as genuine moral requirements.

@article{murphy1993demands,

  title = {The Demands of Beneficence},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy introduces the "cooperative principle" as an alternative to simple consequentialism: the obligation of beneficence requires agents to contribute only their fair share toward achieving the best outcome, calculated on the assumption that others will also contribute their fair shares. This principle limits demands without appealing to agent-relative prerogatives, avoiding both excessive demandingness and the counterintuitive implications of satisficing.

  RELEVANCE: Murphy's cooperative principle provides the strongest theoretical foundation for percentage-based giving norms. If fair shares can be calculated as percentages of income (or wealth), then 10% pledges represent not arbitrary stopping points but principled distributions of the collective burden. This directly supports income-based over purely asset-based norms, as fair shares are naturally calculated from flows rather than stocks.

  POSITION: Limited consequentialism via cooperative fairness; represents a middle path between maximizing demands and agent-relative prerogatives.

  year = {2000},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780195079760.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the 1993 cooperative principle into a systematic nonideal theory. When full compliance is not actual, moral principles must be adjusted to account for the partial compliance context. The cooperative principle applies even when others fail to contribute, but the calculation of fair shares must reflect realistic expectations about compliance. Murphy argues this avoids the "collectivization" problem where individual obligations depend implausibly on aggregate behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the practical challenge that most people do not give their fair share. For utilitarian giving norms, this raises the question: Should norms be calculated assuming full compliance (ideal theory) or actual partial compliance (nonideal theory)? Murphy's approach suggests that percentage-based pledges like 10% might be fair shares under ideal theory, but whether they suffice under nonideal theory depends on empirical compliance rates.

  POSITION: Cooperative consequentialism in nonideal theory; bridges ideal moral principles with realistic expectations.

@book{scheffler1982rejection,
  author = {Scheffler, Samuel},
  title = {The Rejection of Consequentialism: A Philosophical Investigation of the Considerations Underlying Rival Moral Conceptions},
  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1982},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Scheffler introduces "agent-centered prerogatives" - permissions to devote more weight to one's own projects and commitments than strict consequentialism allows. The prerogative is grounded in the independent normative significance of the personal point of view. Agents may permissibly favor their own interests by a certain proportional amount (M) relative to the impersonal good. This structure allows morality to make significant demands while avoiding the extremity of maximizing consequentialism.

  RELEVANCE: Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives provide the canonical alternative to Murphy's cooperative approach for limiting demandingness. The proportional weighting (M) could theoretically justify income-based thresholds: agents may retain M% of income for personal projects. However, Scheffler does not specify M's value, leaving the stopping point arbitrary. This framework better justifies qualitative limits (some giving required, not all) than quantitative thresholds (why 10% rather than 5% or 20%?).

  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2004},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cullity argues that extremely demanding principles of beneficence fail not because they conflict with agent-relative prerogatives, but because they generate an iterative problem: each act of beneficence creates circumstances calling for further beneficence, creating a regress that undermines the possibility of autonomous life-projects. The solution is a "life-shaping" constraint: beneficence must not expand to consume the agent's capacity for autonomous agency. This generates moderate, though still substantial, obligations to aid.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's "life-shaping" approach provides an alternative theoretical foundation for limited giving obligations that avoids both Murphy's dependence on others' compliance and Scheffler's unspecified proportional weighting. The autonomous agency constraint could justify percentage-based norms by defining the threshold at which giving begins to undermine life-projects. However, this threshold varies by individual circumstances, potentially supporting asset-based over uniform income-based norms.

  POSITION: Limited beneficence grounded in autonomous agency; distinct from both cooperative and prerogative-based approaches.

  title = {Demandingness Objections in Ethics},
  journal = {The Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {67},
  number = {266},
  pages = {84--105},
  doi = {10.1093/pq/pqw020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McElwee provides a taxonomic analysis of demandingness objections, distinguishing "cost-based" objections (morality requires too much sacrifice) from "directive force" objections (morality issues too many requirements). He argues that many alleged solutions to demandingness (like satisficing) only address one dimension while failing on the other. A successful response must explain both why certain costs are too demanding and why morality's directive authority has limits.

  RELEVANCE: McElwee's distinction between cost and directive force dimensions illuminates why simple percentage thresholds (like 10%) may not fully solve demandingness. Even if 10% isn't too costly for affluent agents, the continuous obligation to give may create excessive directive force - morality governing too much of life. This suggests that complete giving norms might need both quantitative thresholds (how much) and qualitative limits (when obligation applies).

  POSITION: Meta-level analysis of demandingness objections; argues for multidimensional understanding of what makes theories demanding.

  pages = {1--17},
  url = {http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3521354.0007.008},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sobel argues that the demandingness objection cannot provide independent reason to reject consequentialism because it presupposes anti-consequentialist commitments in determining what counts as "too demanding." The objection must rely on prior judgments about which costs matter morally (personal projects vs. impartial good), but these judgments are precisely what's at issue between consequentialists and their critics. Thus the objection begs the question.

  RELEVANCE: If Sobel is correct, attempts to justify income-based vs. asset-based giving thresholds by appeal to demandingness may be circular: the choice already presupposes a view about whether personal wealth accumulation has moral standing independent of utility maximization. This suggests that the debate over giving norms must be settled on consequentialist grounds (which maximizes utility?) rather than by appeal to intuitions about excessive demands.

  POSITION: Defends consequentialism against demandingness objections; argues the objection lacks independent force.

@article{york2024moral,

  journal = {Journal of Ethics and Social Philosophy},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {28},
  number = {2},
  doi = {10.26556/jesp.v28i2.3130},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: York argues that demandingness should be evaluated not just in the actual world but across possible worlds - theories are demanding to the extent they require significant sacrifices across a wide range of circumstances. This "modal demandingness" reveals that commonsense morality, despite appearing less demanding than consequentialism actually, may be extremely demanding in many possible worlds (e.g., where saving lives requires only minor sacrifices). This undermines purely cost-based demandingness objections.

  RELEVANCE: York's modal approach has implications for evaluating giving norms: income-based thresholds like 10% may appear reasonable in affluent societies but extremely demanding (or insufficiently demanding) in radically different economic circumstances. This suggests that robust giving norms should be formulated with sensitivity to modal variation - perhaps asset-based norms better track what agents can sacrifice across varied economic conditions.

  POSITION: Methodological contribution to demandingness debate; argues for counterfactual evaluation of moral theories.

@book{hooker2000ideal,

  title = {Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality},
  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2000},
  doi = {10.1093/0199256578.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hooker defends rule-consequentialism: the right act is what would be required by the learnable set of rules whose internalization by the overwhelming majority would have the best consequences. This approach, Hooker argues, avoids act-consequentialism's demandingness while maintaining consequentialist foundations. The optimific code will include limited beneficence requirements because unlimited requirements would be unlearnable and would undermine agent motivation.

  RELEVANCE: Rule-consequentialism provides a structural explanation for why utilitarian giving norms should have defined thresholds rather than requiring giving to marginal utility equality. The "learnability" and "internalizability" constraints suggest that simple percentage-based rules (give 10% of income) are more likely part of the optimific code than complex asset-based formulas or unlimited requirements. This supports income-based norms on consequentialist grounds.

  POSITION: Rule-consequentialism as solution to demandingness; argues for moderate, internalize beneficence rules.

  number = {2},
  pages = {97--108},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820806001877},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bradley argues that satisficing consequentialism - which permits agents to aim for "good enough" outcomes rather than optimal ones - faces fatal objections. Crucially, satisficing permits agents to prevent better outcomes from obtaining, which violates the core consequentialist commitment that better outcomes are always preferable. Any coherent satisficing view must explain why it's permissible to block improvements, but no such explanation is compatible with genuine consequentialism.

  RELEVANCE: Bradley's critique challenges attempts to justify fixed giving thresholds (like 10% of income) on satisficing grounds. If giving 15% would produce better outcomes than 10%, satisficing seems to permit arbitrarily stopping at 10%, which conflicts with consequentialist foundations. This suggests that defensible income-based thresholds must be grounded in something other than satisficing - perhaps Murphy's cooperative principle or Hooker's rule-consequentialism.

  pages = {149--157},
  doi = {10.1007/s11406-021-00382-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McKay proposes a revised satisficing consequentialism that avoids Bradley's objection by incorporating an "effort ceiling" - agents must produce at least as much good as they could given how much effort they're exerting, but need not exert maximal effort. This allows satisficing to respond to demandingness (by limiting effort required) while avoiding the implication that agents may gratuitously prevent better outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: McKay's effort-based satisficing could justify giving norms based on effort constraints rather than fixed percentages. This might support more flexible norms than strict income-based thresholds: agents exerting high effort in careers with significant social value might have lower giving obligations than those in less socially valuable work, even at equal incomes. However, operationalizing "effort" comparisons seems challenging for practical giving norms.

@article{hurka1990two,

  volume = {59},
  number = {1},
  pages = {107--111},
  doi = {10.1007/BF00368395},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hurka distinguishes two versions of satisficing: "good enough" satisficing (achieving outcomes above a threshold) and "close enough" satisficing (achieving outcomes sufficiently close to optimal). He argues that only "good enough" satisficing is plausible, as "close enough" satisficing permits arbitrary choices between equally-close-to-optimal alternatives without principled justification.

  RELEVANCE: Hurka's distinction clarifies the theoretical options for threshold-based giving norms. "Good enough" satisficing would require giving sufficient to address poverty effectively (absolute threshold), while "close enough" satisficing would require giving close to the optimal amount (relative threshold). Income-based percentages might represent "good enough" thresholds if they achieve adequate aggregate relief, but this requires empirical validation that the threshold is actually sufficient.

  pages = {1--27},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199662951.003.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hurka and Shubert defend agent-relative permissions via a "moving band" approach: the permission to favor oneself varies with the stakes involved. At low stakes, agents have wide permissions to favor personal interests; as stakes increase (more good at risk), permissions narrow. This avoids both implausible absolutism (same permission at all stakes) and the collapse into full consequentialism (no permissions at high stakes).

  RELEVANCE: The "moving band" structure could justify graduated giving obligations based on wealth levels: the very wealthy have narrower permissions to retain wealth than the moderately affluent. This might support progressive asset-based norms over flat income-based percentages - those with vast wealth have stronger obligations to give because the stakes (lives saved per dollar) are so high. The approach provides theoretical grounding for graduated rather than flat percentage pledges.

  volume = {113},
  number = {2},
  pages = {303--332},
  doi = {10.1086/342859},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Portmore argues that agent-centered options can be accommodated within consequentialism by adopting "position-relative" consequentialism, which evaluates acts relative to agent-relative value rankings. On this view, it can be right for an agent to choose A over B even though B produces more impersonal value, because A produces more agent-relative value from that agent's perspective. This reconciles options with consequentialist structure.

  RELEVANCE: Position-relative consequentialism could justify different giving obligations for differently-situated agents on consequentialist grounds: agents with dependent children or local community ties might face different optimization functions than single cosmopolitans. This framework better supports context-sensitive asset-based norms than uniform income-based percentages, as agent-relative value depends on total resources and responsibilities, not just income flows.

  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198844990.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Norcross defends "scalar consequentialism," which abandons deontic categories (right/wrong, obligatory/permissible) entirely in favor of purely scalar evaluation (better/worse). On this view, there are no obligations or permissions, only actions that produce more or less good. This dissolves the demandingness objection: there's nothing to be too demanding about if there are no demands, only a spectrum from better to worse actions.

  RELEVANCE: Scalar consequentialism radically reframes the question about giving norms: there's no threshold separating obligatory from supererogatory giving, just a continuum where more giving is always better. This challenges the very coherence of debates over whether 10% vs. 20% is "required" - all such questions dissolve into questions of degree. However, for practical purposes, scalar consequentialism provides no action-guidance on where to stop giving, which is precisely what giving pledges attempt to provide.

  number = {1},
  pages = {233--255},
  doi = {10.1111/papq.12252},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lazar examines how consequentialist theories can accommodate agent-relative options without abandoning consequentialism's core commitments. He argues that options must be grounded in facts about value (what makes outcomes good) rather than facts about agency (what preserves autonomy). Options are permissible when allowing agents to favor their own interests produces better outcomes than requiring impartiality, considering effects on agent motivation and social coordination.

  RELEVANCE: Lazar's value-based grounding for options suggests that giving thresholds should be justified by their consequences for overall utility, including effects on agent motivation and social trust. This supports moderate income-based norms like 10% if: (a) they maximize long-term compliance compared to more demanding rules, and (b) they coordinate social expectations effectively. The approach combines elements of Hooker's rule-consequentialism with Scheffler's options framework.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mikl\'{o}s and Tanyi propose "institutional consequentialism" as a response to demandingness: institutions, rather than individuals, should bear the consequentialist burden of maximizing utility. Individuals have obligations to establish and maintain appropriate institutions, but in functioning institutional contexts, individuals face only moderate demands. This shifts excessive demands from individual beneficence to institutional design and support.

  RELEVANCE: Institutional consequentialism suggests that individual giving obligations should be calibrated to existing institutional capacity: where effective poverty-relief institutions exist, individual obligations may be limited to tax support and modest supplemental giving; where institutions fail, individual obligations expand. This could justify variable giving norms across contexts rather than universal income-based percentages - higher individual giving obligations in contexts of institutional failure.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Woollard examines Hooker's rule-consequentialist treatment of the "disaster clause" - the override that permits violating ordinary rules when necessary to prevent catastrophic outcomes. She argues that Hooker can maintain space for vagueness in what counts as "disaster" while avoiding over-demandingness. The optimific code need not specify precise thresholds, and this vagueness is a virtue rather than a vice.

  RELEVANCE: Woollard's defense of vague thresholds in rule-consequentialism has implications for giving norms: perhaps there's no precise answer to "exactly how much must I give?" compatible with rule-consequentialism. This could support ranges rather than fixed percentages (e.g., "give 5-15% of income") and explains why debates over exact thresholds (10% vs. 12%) may be misguided - the optimific code permits reasonable variation around a vague standard.
