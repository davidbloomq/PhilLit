# Literature Review Plan: Utilitarian Giving Norms — Income vs. Asset-Based Obligations

## Research Idea Summary

This project examines whether utilitarian obligations to charitable giving are better implemented through income-based norms (e.g., the 10% pledge) or asset-based norms. The central hypothesis is that assets beyond a reasonable security threshold have lower marginal utility than income, which remains tied to ongoing needs. Consequently, asset-sensitive giving strategies may be favored under expected-utility assumptions, yet existing philanthropic norms neglect this asymmetry.

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the philosophical basis for utilitarian obligations to give to charity, and how demanding are these obligations?
2. How does marginal utility theory apply differently to income versus net assets, and what are the welfare implications?
3. Why do existing philanthropic norms (e.g., Giving What We Can) emphasize income-based commitments, and is this emphasis morally justified?
4. What considerations bear on the timing of giving — immediate donation versus wealth accumulation and deferred giving?
5. Are there principled reasons to treat assets differently from income in formulating giving obligations?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Utilitarian Foundations of Charitable Obligation

**Focus**: Core arguments establishing utilitarian duties to aid others, from Singer's original argument to contemporary refinements.

**Key Questions**:
- What grounds the utilitarian obligation to give?
- How do different utilitarian theories (act, rule, indirect) frame this obligation?
- What is the relationship between beneficence, justice, and charity in utilitarian frameworks?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP articles on "Consequentialism," "The History of Utilitarianism," "Moral Demands of Affluence"
- PhilPapers categories: Normative Ethics > Consequentialism; Applied Ethics > Poverty and Aid
- Key terms: ["utilitarian obligation charity", "duty to aid poor", "Singer famine affluence", "beneficence consequentialism", "impartial welfarism giving"]
- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Establishes the philosophical foundation that generates the obligation question. Without clarity on the nature of utilitarian giving obligations, the income vs. asset question cannot be properly framed.

### Domain 2: Demandingness and Limits of Utilitarian Obligation

**Focus**: The demandingness objection to utilitarianism and responses, including threshold views, satisficing, and agent-relative prerogatives.

**Key Questions**:
- How demanding is the utilitarian obligation to give? Must agents give until marginal utility equals?
- What are principled stopping points for utilitarian giving?
- How do satisficing and threshold views modify the obligation?
- What role do agent-relative permissions play in limiting demands?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP article on "The Limits of Moral Obligation"; PhilPapers on demandingness
- Key terms: ["demandingness objection utilitarianism", "limits moral obligation", "satisficing consequentialism", "agent-relative prerogatives", "how much should we give", "threshold giving"]
- Expected papers: 15-20 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: The demandingness debate determines what counts as "enough" giving. If utilitarian demands are limitless, the income vs. asset question becomes moot; if limits exist, their placement directly affects the comparison.

---

### Domain 3: Marginal Utility Theory — Income, Wealth, and Welfare

**Focus**: Economic and philosophical literature on the marginal utility of money, with specific attention to differences between income streams and asset stocks.

**Key Questions**:
- How does marginal utility of money decline with income vs. with wealth?
- What functions do assets serve beyond consumption (insurance, optionality, status)?
- At what thresholds do additional assets cease contributing meaningfully to welfare?
- How do positional goods and relative wealth affect utility calculations?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Economics literature via OpenAlex; philosophical discussions of welfare economics
- Key terms: ["marginal utility income", "marginal utility wealth", "diminishing returns money", "welfare economics wealth", "precautionary savings utility", "positional goods wealth"]
- Cross-disciplinary: Economic Journal, Journal of Economic Perspectives, QJE
- Expected papers: 15-20 key papers (mix of philosophy and economics)

**Relevance to Project**: Central to the hypothesis. The claim that assets have systematically lower marginal utility than income requires empirical and theoretical support. This domain tests whether the income/asset asymmetry is well-founded.

---

### Domain 4: Effective Altruism and Contemporary Philanthropic Norms

**Focus**: The effective altruism movement, Giving What We Can pledges, and the normative frameworks underlying contemporary giving practices.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the basis for the 10% income pledge and similar norms?
- How do EA philosophers justify income-based giving norms?
- What empirical evidence exists on giving behavior and motivation?
- Are there explicit discussions of asset-based alternatives within EA?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: PhilPapers on effective altruism; SEP article on "Effective Altruism"
- Key terms: ["effective altruism", "Giving What We Can", "10 percent pledge", "earning to give", "philanthropic norms", "optimal giving"]
- Additional sources: Journal of Practical Ethics, EA Forum philosophical posts
- Expected papers: 12-15 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: This domain covers the "status quo" that the research critiques. Understanding why existing norms emphasize income is necessary before arguing for asset-based alternatives.

---

### Domain 5: Wealth Ethics, Asset Inequality, and Distributive Justice

**Focus**: Philosophical literature on wealth accumulation, inheritance, asset inequality, and whether holdings (vs. flows) generate special obligations.

**Key Questions**:
- Is there a distinct ethics of wealth beyond income ethics?
- What obligations attach to asset holdings vs. income flows?
- How do inheritance, intergenerational justice, and wealth concentration bear on giving?
- What is the relationship between asset redistribution and charitable giving?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP articles on "Distributive Justice," "Inheritance and Wealth Transfer"
- PhilPapers categories: Political Philosophy > Economic Justice; Applied Ethics > Wealth
- Key terms: ["ethics wealth accumulation", "wealth inequality obligations", "inheritance justice", "asset redistribution", "capital versus income justice", "wealth taxation philosophy"]
- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Provides independent reasons (beyond marginal utility) to treat assets differently from income. May reveal existing arguments for asset-based obligations that could strengthen the research.

---

### Domain 6: Time-Discounting, Deferred Giving, and Investment Ethics

**Focus**: The temporal dimension of giving: whether to donate now or invest and donate later, and the ethics of time-discounting in philanthropic contexts.

**Key Questions**:
- Should donors give now or invest for larger future donations?
- How should philanthropic time-discounting differ from personal time-discounting?
- What are the opportunity costs of asset holding versus immediate giving?
- How do investment returns, cause timing, and future uncertainty affect optimal giving strategies?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: PhilPapers on philanthropy timing; EA literature on give now vs. later
- Key terms: ["give now versus later", "philanthropic investment", "patient philanthropy", "time discounting charity", "opportunity cost giving", "deferred donation"]
- Semantic Scholar: recent papers on philanthropy timing
- Expected papers: 10-15 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: The income vs. asset question connects to timing. Asset-based giving may involve deferred donation through investment. This domain examines when such strategies are justified.

---

### Domain 7: Objections, Limitations, and Critical Perspectives

**Focus**: Arguments against utilitarian giving obligations, critiques of effective altruism, and reasons to be skeptical of the income/asset asymmetry hypothesis.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the strongest objections to utilitarian demands to give?
- Do deontological or virtue ethics perspectives reject asset-based obligations?
- Are there reasons the income/asset asymmetry might not hold (e.g., liquidity, agency)?
- What practical or motivational considerations favor income-based norms?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: PhilPapers on critiques of EA and utilitarian giving
- Key terms: ["critique effective altruism", "against utilitarian charity", "limits philanthropy", "objections Singer", "virtue ethics charity", "deontological giving"]
- Expected papers: 10-12 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Essential for balanced analysis. The research should anticipate objections, including reasons the status quo (income-based norms) may be correct despite the marginal utility argument.

## Coverage Rationale

These seven domains provide comprehensive coverage by addressing:

1. **Foundational theory** (Domains 1-2): Why utilitarians must give and how much
2. **Core hypothesis** (Domain 3): The marginal utility asymmetry between income and assets
3. **Current practice** (Domain 4): Existing norms and their justification
4. **Alternative frameworks** (Domain 5): Independent reasons for asset-based obligations
5. **Temporal dimension** (Domain 6): The timing question that connects income/asset issues
6. **Critical balance** (Domain 7): Objections and limitations

The domains are ordered from foundational to applied, with the critical domain ensuring the review is not merely confirmatory.

## Expected Gaps

Based on preliminary analysis, the research may address:

1. **Systematic comparison**: No existing work directly compares income vs. asset norms from a utilitarian perspective
2. **Marginal utility application**: While marginal utility of money is studied, its differential application to income vs. assets for giving norms is underexplored
3. **Threshold identification**: Little philosophical work specifies at what asset level the marginal utility argument kicks in
4. **Integration**: The EA literature and wealth ethics literature are not well integrated

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 7
- **Estimated papers**: 85-120 total
- **Key positions**: Singer-style strong demands; satisficing/threshold views; EA pragmatism; wealth ethics perspectives; give-now vs. give-later

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Singer (1972), Unger (1996), Scheffler on prerogatives, MacAskill on EA
2. **Recent developments**: Post-2015 EA literature, recent wealth inequality ethics, patient philanthropy debates
3. **Critical responses**: Critiques of EA (e.g., Srinivasan), demandingness literature, virtue ethics on giving
4. **Empirical grounding**: Economics literature on marginal utility of wealth vs. income

## Notes for Researchers

- **Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**: `search_sep.py` for foundational articles, `search_philpapers.py` for philosophical literature, `s2_search.py` for recent academic work
- **Cross-disciplinary searches**: Domain 3 requires economics literature — use `search_openalex.py` for welfare economics and `s2_search.py` with economics filters
- **Recent papers**: Use `--recent` flag for Domains 4 and 6 where EA and patient philanthropy debates are evolving
- **SEP priority**: Start Domains 1, 2, 4, and 5 with SEP for foundational context before searching for individual papers
- **Balance confirmatory and critical**: Domain 7 should receive thorough attention; do not underweight objections to the research hypothesis
- **BibTeX annotations**: Include detailed abstracts and relevance notes, especially for the income/asset distinction when papers discuss it
- **Author networks**: Peter Singer, William MacAskill, Toby Ord, Samuel Scheffler, and Liam Murphy are central figures; track their work and citations
