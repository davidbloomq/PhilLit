## The Case for Income-Asset Asymmetry

The utilitarian case for giving obligations rests on the diminishing marginal utility of money: each additional dollar provides less welfare to those who already have more. Yet this foundational principle has been applied almost exclusively to income flows rather than wealth stocks, despite the significant conceptual and empirical differences between them. This section develops the central theoretical argument that income and assets have systematically different marginal utility profiles, providing potential grounds for asset-sensitive giving norms.

### Marginal Utility of Income and Consumption

The empirical literature on marginal utility has established robust estimates of the elasticity of marginal utility of income, the parameter governing how quickly utility gains decline as income rises. Layard, Mayraz, and Nickell (2008), using life satisfaction data across and within countries, estimate an elasticity of approximately 1.26, implying that the relationship between income and utility is roughly logarithmic. This means a one percent increase in income generates roughly equal utility gains regardless of baseline income level—a finding with profound implications for redistribution. Evans (2005) arrives at similar conclusions using consumption data for OECD countries, finding elasticities ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 with most estimates between 1.0 and 1.5. The most recent comprehensive synthesis, by Acland and Greenberg (2023), recommends an elasticity of 1.6 (with sensitivity bounds of 1.2-2.0) for policy applications, reflecting methodological consensus across decades of empirical work.

However, a critical limitation pervades this literature: the conflation of income flows with wealth stocks. Studies estimate "marginal utility of income" without disaggregating how the utility functions might differ between a dollar received as current income versus a dollar held as accumulated wealth. Gandelman and Hernandez-Murillo (2015), estimating risk aversion using happiness data across 75 countries, find remarkable consistency in parameters—but again treat all monetary resources equivalently. The project's central hypothesis—that income and wealth have distinct marginal utility profiles—cannot be directly tested using existing estimates, because the foundational measurement work does not distinguish between these categories.

### The Distinctive Functions of Wealth

Wealth serves functions that income alone cannot fulfill, and these distinctive functions create threshold effects in marginal utility that the income-consumption literature misses. The most important is the precautionary savings motive: accumulated assets provide insurance against future income shocks. Crainich, Eeckhoudt, and Trannoy (2013) demonstrate that even individuals who are risk-loving (with convex utility in wealth) exhibit prudence—they accumulate precautionary savings against uncertainty. This finding establishes that wealth accumulation for insurance purposes is a robust behavioral pattern across different utility specifications, not merely a feature of risk aversion.

The empirical evidence on household finance confirms that wealth levels dramatically affect consumption responses to income changes. Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar (2020) show enormous heterogeneity in marginal propensity to consume: low-wealth households spend most of windfall gains while high-wealth households smooth consumption effectively. This asymmetry reveals that wealth's marginal utility is much higher for low-wealth households—where precautionary needs remain unmet—than for high-wealth households who possess adequate buffers. A threshold effect emerges: once sufficient insurance has been accumulated, additional wealth provides diminishing utility because the precautionary motive is satiated.

Beyond insurance, wealth serves as a positional good whose value depends partly on relative standing. Ghosh and Wendner (2018) analyze economies where households care about both absolute and relative wealth, demonstrating that positional preferences lead to over-accumulation of capital relative to social optima. Individuals fail to internalize the negative externality of reducing others' relative position through their own accumulation. This creates a wedge between private and social marginal utility: from society's perspective, the marginal utility of additional wealth declines more steeply than individuals perceive, because much of the perceived value is zero-sum status competition. Freiman (2014) argues that prioritarians should account for positional characteristics because they affect absolute wellbeing, not merely relative standing—when goods are partially positional, scarcity creates genuine welfare differences that utilitarian and prioritarian frameworks alike must address.

The synthesis of these literatures suggests a hypothesis that existing marginal utility estimates fail to capture: wealth beyond reasonable security thresholds may have systematically lower marginal utility than equivalent income. Income enables consumption and maintains living standards; wealth beyond insurance needs primarily serves positional competition where gains to one are largely offset by losses to others.

### Wealth Ethics and Non-Utilitarian Considerations

Independent of utilitarian marginal utility calculations, the philosophical literature on wealth ethics provides additional reasons for treating assets differently from income. Halliday (2018) argues that inheritance is unjust to the extent that it perpetuates intergenerational inequality, concentrating advantage across generations and undermining fair equality of opportunity. While income inequality affects contemporaries, wealth transmission compounds inequality over time. This temporal dimension distinguishes assets from income flows in normatively significant ways: present wealth holdings represent not merely current capacity but future intergenerational transfers.

Robeyns (2017) develops limitarianism—the view that there should be upper bounds on permissible wealth holdings. She grounds this position in multiple considerations: extreme wealth could meet urgent unmet needs elsewhere, undermines political equality, and reflects objectionable political processes. Crucially, limitarianism targets wealth stocks rather than income flows, representing a clear case where assets are thought to generate obligations distinct from those arising from ongoing income. Volacu (2022) refines the democratic argument for limitarianism, focusing on how excessive wealth threatens democratic resilience beyond its effects on formal political equality—concentrated wealth corrodes democratic institutions through channels that income inequality alone cannot.

Wilson (2021) identifies a tension in "philanthrocapitalism"—massive giving by the ultra-wealthy—that illuminates the distinctive ethical character of extreme asset holdings. Such philanthropy is only possible under conditions of extreme wealth inequality that may itself be unjust; the very capacity for mega-giving depends on a prior distribution that egalitarians would challenge. This does not necessarily condemn large-scale giving, but it suggests that asset-based norms must engage with wealth ethics, not merely utilitarian optimization. Arneson (2002), arguing from a luck egalitarian framework, contends that justice requires transfers to offset both income and wealth inequalities because both affect what individuals can achieve. Yet his framework does not fully develop whether the temporal structures of flow versus stock generate different obligations—leaving conceptual space for the project's inquiry.

### The Temporal Dimension and Deferred Giving

Asset-based giving norms intersect with questions of philanthropic timing in ways that income-based norms largely avoid. When obligations attach to accumulated wealth, the question arises whether that wealth should be donated immediately or invested for potentially larger future donations. Broome (1994) establishes the anti-discounting position foundational to this debate: discounting future benefits merely because they occur in the future—pure time preference—is ethically arbitrary. Legitimate discounting for uncertainty or diminishing marginal utility is distinct from pure time preference. If this view is correct, deferred giving cannot be justified by temporal location alone.

MacAskill (2023) provides the most systematic framework for give-now-versus-later decisions within effective altruism. He identifies four key parameters: expected investment returns, the rate of diminishing returns to funding for specific causes, correlation between investment returns and cause importance, and existential risk. For causes with rapidly diminishing returns to funding, giving now is likely optimal; for emerging or speculative causes, patient philanthropy may be justified. This framework reveals that optimal timing depends on empirical parameters rather than pure time preference—and these parameters may interact differently with asset-based versus income-based norms.

Cordelli and Reich (2016) examine the intergenerational justice implications of deferred giving through endowments. They argue that such structures raise questions about whether current donors may permissibly prioritize future over present beneficiaries, and whether elite control of intergenerational resource allocation is democratically legitimate. Harris (2021) offers a more favorable view of patient philanthropy, developing a model where investors with high urgency allocate to immediate giving while more patient investors hold "mission-correlated assets"—investments whose returns correlate with favorable developments in their impact opportunity set. This suggests that the choice between immediate and deferred giving is not binary: strategic asset management may outperform both immediate liquidation and pure wealth maximization.

Mogensen (2019) explores whether agent-relative partiality could justify positive intergenerational time preference—giving greater weight to nearer generations. While skeptical that this argument succeeds, he treats it as the strongest case for time preference in philanthropic contexts. The interaction between asset-based norms and temporal strategies remains underexplored: if assets trigger obligations but those obligations may be fulfilled through investment rather than immediate donation, then asset-based norms may not differ as sharply from income-based norms in their practical implications as their theoretical foundations suggest.

The emerging synthesis points toward a research gap: if wealth's marginal utility declines more steeply than income's above security thresholds—due to satiation of precautionary motives and the positional character of excess wealth—then asset-based norms may generate greater welfare improvements per unit of subjective sacrifice than income-based norms. Non-utilitarian considerations from wealth ethics reinforce this asymmetry by identifying features of asset holdings (intergenerational transmission, political power, positional externalities) that lack analogues in income flows. Yet no existing work directly tests whether asset-based norms would outperform income-based norms under expected-utility assumptions, nor specifies the thresholds at which the argument for asset-based obligations becomes compelling.
