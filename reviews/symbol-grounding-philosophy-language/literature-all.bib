DOMAIN: Symbol Grounding Problem - Core Formulations and Reviews
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The symbol grounding problem (SGP), formulated by Stevan Harnad in 1990, originates from Searle's Chinese Room Argument and asks how symbols in a computational system acquire intrinsic semantic content rather than merely parasitic meaning derived from an external interpreter. Harnad's original formulation proposed hybrid symbolic/connectionist systems with sensorimotor grounding as a solution. The field has since generated diverse approaches: sensorimotor embodiment (Vogt 2002), action-based semantics (Taddeo & Floridi 2005, 2007), social grounding (Steels 2008), and causal-historical theories (Bielecka 2015). Critical debates persist about whether the problem has been solved (Steels 2008 vs. Bringsjord 2015), what constitutes a valid solution (Müller 2015), and whether proposed solutions satisfy the "zero semantic commitment" condition (Bielecka 2015). Recent work extends SGP to large language models (Gubelmann 2024, Floridi et al. 2025), challenging whether LLMs circumvent or genuinely address the problem.

The core debate concerns whether symbols can be grounded in: (a) nonsymbolic sensorimotor capacities; (b) action/interaction patterns; (c) formal/computational structures alone; or (d) whether grounding requires phenomenal consciousness. Most solutions appeal to embodiment, robotics, or hybrid architectures, but critics argue these merely shift rather than solve the problem.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain establishes the SGP as formulated within cognitive science and AI, providing the foundation for investigating how philosophers of language engage with it. The hypothesis that SGP may presuppose a narrow meta-semantic view (possibly denotational semantics) can be evaluated by examining which semantic theories are implicitly or explicitly assumed in these formulations and proposed solutions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While extensive work addresses sensorimotor and robotic grounding, there is limited engagement with mainstream philosophy of language traditions (Fregean, Davidsonian, Kripkean approaches). Few papers explicitly connect SGP to meta-semantic debates about what determines reference. The assumption that symbols must be "grounded" in a specific way is rarely questioned from the perspective of use-based or inferentialist semantics.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should distinguish foundational formulations (Harnad, Searle) from proposed solutions and critical evaluations. Map the solution space along dimensions: symbolic/nonsymbolic, representationalist/non-representationalist, internalist/externalist. Identify implicit semantic assumptions in each approach for later comparison with philosophy of language literature in other domains.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Hybrid sensorimotor grounding (Harnad 1990, Vogt 2002): 6 papers - Symbols must be grounded bottom-up via nonsymbolic categorical perception
- Action-based semantics (Taddeo & Floridi 2005-2007): 3 papers - Grounding via agent-environment interaction patterns
- Social/cultural grounding (Steels 2008): 2 papers - Language games and cultural emergence solve SGP
- Skeptics (Bringsjord 2015, Bielecka 2015, Müller 2015): 3 papers - SGP remains unsolved or poorly formulated
- LLM-related (Gubelmann 2024, Floridi 2025): 2 papers - Whether LLMs circumvent or fail the SGP

DOMAIN: Philosophy of Language - Theories of Meaning and Reference
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 20 total (High: 8, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses the major philosophical theories of linguistic meaning
and reference. The central debate concerns how expressions acquire meaning:
through reference to objects in the world (referentialism/denotationalism),
through descriptive content associated with expressions (descriptivism), through
inferential relations between expressions (inferentialism), or through use in
language games (use theories). The Kripke-Putnam revolution in the 1970s
established direct reference theory and semantic externalism as dominant
positions, challenging Fregean descriptivism. Recent decades have seen renewed
interest in inferentialist alternatives (Brandom) and two-dimensional semantics
(Chalmers) that attempt to reconcile referentialist insights with the role of
conceptual content. Metasemantics—theories about what facts ground meaning—has
emerged as a distinct field examining whether meaning is fixed by causal-
historical chains, community practices, functional roles, or normative
inferential patterns.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The symbol grounding problem presupposes that symbols require "grounding" in
non-symbolic reality—a claim that makes most sense within referentialist/
denotational frameworks where meaning is fundamentally about word-world
relations. Alternative theories (inferentialism, use theories, conceptual role
semantics) suggest meaning might be constituted by intralinguistic relations,
making the grounding problem appear theoretically parochial rather than
universal. This domain provides the theoretical apparatus to assess whether
SGP implicitly assumes one metasemantic view and whether it dissolves under
alternative frameworks.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The connection between theories of meaning and the symbol grounding problem
remains underexplored in philosophy of language. Few papers explicitly examine
how different metasemantic theories bear on grounding requirements for AI
systems. The literature would benefit from work examining whether inferentialist
or use-theoretic frameworks make the SGP disappear or transform it into a
different kind of problem.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize the synthesis around competing metasemantic visions: (1) referentialist
views that make grounding central, (2) descriptivist views where grounding is
mediated by sense, (3) inferentialist views where meaning is role in reasoning,
(4) use theories where meaning is practice-embedded. Show how each framework
would diagnose the SGP differently. Recent metasemantics literature (Speaks,
Burgess-Sherman) provides tools for this comparison.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Direct Reference/Causal Theories: 8 papers - Kripke, Donnellan, Devitt establish that proper names and natural kind terms refer directly via causal-historical chains, not descriptive content
- Inferentialism: 6 papers - Brandom, Peregrin, Hlobil argue meaning is constituted by inferential role in reasoning practices
- Two-Dimensional Semantics: 2 papers - Chalmers attempts to reconcile Kripkean insights with role of conceptual content
- Metasemantics: 4 papers - Recent work on what grounds meaning facts (externalism, conceptual role, normative patterns)

DOMAIN: Meta-semantics and Semantic Foundations
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Meta-semantics investigates what makes semantic facts obtain—the foundations
of meaning itself. It asks: in virtue of what do expressions have the semantic
contents they do? This domain is distinct from first-order semantics (which
specifies what expressions mean) and addresses the grounding question of what
determines those meanings. Major positions include: use-based accounts (meaning
grounded in linguistic practice), causal-historical theories (reference fixed
by causal chains), teleosemantic views (meaning grounded in biological function),
interpretationist approaches (meaning determined by interpretation), and
reference magnetism (naturalness constrains reference). Recent work has
increasingly questioned idealized assumptions in traditional meta-semantics,
exploring non-ideal foundations that account for power, diversity of goals,
and social position. The field has also seen growth in conceptual engineering—
the normative project of revising concepts—which raises meta-semantic questions
about the feasibility and mechanisms of semantic change.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to evaluating whether the symbol grounding problem (SGP)
presupposes a narrow meta-semantic view. If the SGP assumes denotational or
referential semantics must be grounded in a particular way, examining the full
landscape of meta-semantic positions reveals whether that assumption is
warranted. The recent emphasis on non-ideal foundations and use-based accounts
provides alternatives to purely referential approaches, potentially dissolving
or reframing the grounding problem.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Relatively few papers directly connect meta-semantic theory to the symbol
grounding problem as formulated in AI/cognitive science. Most meta-semantic
work focuses on natural language rather than formal or artificial symbol
systems. The interaction between meta-semantics and embodied/grounded cognition
remains under-explored philosophically.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay attention to the distinction between semantic theories (which specify
meanings) and meta-semantic theories (which explain what grounds those meanings).
Consider whether different meta-semantic positions would diagnose the SGP
differently—some might see it as a pseudo-problem arising from false meta-
semantic assumptions. The recent turn toward non-ideal and pragmatic foundations
may offer resources for reframing grounding concerns.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Interpretationism (5 papers): Meaning determined by interpretation practices
- Reference magnetism (4 papers): Natural properties constrain reference
- Use-based theories (3 papers): Linguistic practice grounds meaning
- Non-ideal foundations (3 papers): Social context shapes semantic facts
- Conceptual engineering (3 papers): Normative dimension of meaning revision

DOMAIN: Philosophy of Mind - Intentionality and Mental Content
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the fundamental problem of how mental states have
content and are "about" things in the world. The field divides into
several major theoretical camps: (1) Causal theories (Dretske, Fodor)
explain mental content through informational/causal relations between
mental states and worldly states of affairs. (2) Teleosemantic theories
(Millikan) ground content in biological functions shaped by natural
selection. (3) Conceptual role semantics emphasizes inferential
connections among mental states. (4) Phenomenal intentionality theories
(Loar, Kriegel, Mendelovici) argue that consciousness itself grounds
intentionality. (5) Externalist theories (Burge, Putnam) hold that
mental content is partially constituted by environmental factors.

The Chinese Room argument (Searle 1980) presents a decisive challenge to
computational theories of mind, arguing that syntactic symbol manipulation
cannot generate genuine semantic understanding. This connects directly to
the symbol grounding problem: computational systems manipulate formal
symbols, but these symbols lack intrinsic meaning. Searle's argument has
motivated both defenses of biological bases for intentionality and
attempts to naturalize intentionality within computational frameworks.

Recent work has extended these debates to large language models,
questioning whether statistical patterns can constitute genuine
linguistic intentionality (Grindrod 2024). The field exhibits ongoing
tension between internalist approaches (content supervenes on intrinsic
states) and externalist approaches (content depends on environmental
relations).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The symbol grounding problem is fundamentally a problem about
intentionality: How do symbols come to be about things? Philosophical
theories of mental content provide crucial background for understanding
different meta-semantic assumptions that might underlie the SGP.
Externalist theories suggest the SGP may presuppose an overly narrow,
internalist conception of content. Phenomenal intentionality theories
offer alternatives to purely computational accounts. Understanding these
debates is essential for evaluating whether the SGP rests on contentious
meta-semantic assumptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While extensive work addresses the metaphysics of intentionality, less
attention has been paid to how different meta-semantic theories
specifically relate to the SGP formulation. The connection between
conceptual role semantics and symbol grounding remains under-explored.
Recent LLM work has just begun connecting to these traditional debates.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should map how different theories of mental content imply
different views on symbol grounding. Pay special attention to the
internalism/externalism divide and whether externalist meta-semantics
dissolves or reshapes the SGP. The Chinese Room provides a crucial
bridge between philosophy of mind and computational linguistics.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Causal/Informational Theories: 5 papers - Content arises from
  causal-informational relations (Dretske, Fodor)
- Teleosemantics: 4 papers - Content grounded in biological function
  (Millikan, Neander)
- Phenomenal Intentionality: 4 papers - Consciousness grounds
  intentionality (Loar, Mendelovici, Kriegel)
- Externalism: 3 papers - Content depends on environmental factors

DOMAIN: Philosophical Critiques of the Symbol Grounding Problem
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 6, Medium: 6, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The symbol grounding problem (SGP), formulated by Harnad in 1990, asks how
computational symbols can be intrinsically meaningful rather than parasitic on
human interpretation. Philosophical engagement with the SGP reveals deep
disagreements about whether it represents a genuine problem or rests on
confused assumptions about meaning and semantics. Critics argue that the SGP
presupposes a narrow, denotational view of semantics and neglects alternative
theories of meaning (use-based, inferentialist, or pragmatist accounts). A
central debate concerns whether the problem assumes a computational theory of
mind that many philosophers reject. Recent work questions whether the SGP
applies to modern AI systems like LLMs or whether it dissolves when proper
attention is paid to the role of linguistic practice and normativity.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central hypothesis: that the SGP may
presuppose a narrow meta-semantic view. Papers here examine which theoretical
commitments underlie the problem's formulation and whether alternative
frameworks (pragmatism, inferentialism, use theories) render it ill-posed or
solvable. Understanding these critiques is essential to evaluating whether
the SGP identifies a genuine constraint or reflects unexamined semantic
assumptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial critique of proposed *solutions* to the SGP, there
is less direct philosophical analysis of whether the problem's *formulation*
itself is theoretically coherent. Few papers explicitly connect Wittgensteinian
meaning-as-use perspectives to the SGP debate. Recent AI developments (LLMs,
multimodal models) have prompted new evaluations, but systematic philosophical
engagement with these systems remains limited.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Key tension: Is the SGP a genuine explanatory challenge or does it presuppose
questionable meta-semantic commitments (e.g., that meaning requires causal
grounding in sensory experience, or that semantics is fundamentally
denotational)? Synthesis should trace how different semantic frameworks
(referentialist, inferentialist, pragmatist) generate different attitudes
toward the problem. Consider also whether recent critiques of the SGP's
applicability to LLMs reveal deeper issues with the problem's scope.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- SGP as genuine problem: 6 papers - Harnad's original formulation and
  defenders arguing the problem remains unsolved
- SGP as ill-posed/pseudo-problem: 5 papers - Critics arguing it presupposes
  flawed semantic theories or computational assumptions
- Alternative framings: 4 papers - Attempts to reframe the problem in more
  tractable terms or identify which version deserves attention

DOMAIN: Contemporary Philosophy of AI and Language Models
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-09
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 10, Medium: 6, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP (AI entry), PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain represents the most recent wave of philosophical engagement with
large language models (LLMs), emerging primarily from 2023-2025. The appearance
of models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and ChatGPT has reinvigorated classical debates
about meaning, understanding, and symbol grounding in unexpected ways. Three
major positions have crystallized: (1) LLMs demonstrate that sensorimotor
grounding is not necessary for linguistic understanding (Chalmers, Lyre, Havlík);
(2) LLMs reveal that understanding requires more than statistical patterns and
lack genuine semantic grounding (Harnad, Bottazzi & Ferrario); and (3) LLMs
operate through alternative semantic frameworks like inferentialism or semiotics
rather than traditional referential semantics (Arai & Tsugawa, Picca). A
distinctive feature of this literature is its use of LLMs as test cases for
philosophical theories of meaning, reversing the traditional direction where
philosophy evaluates AI. The "stochastic parrots" critique (Bender et al. 2021)
serves as a central reference point, with several papers directly responding to
it. Recent work increasingly focuses on mechanistic interpretability findings
(world models, feature formation) as evidence for or against understanding.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether contemporary LLMs solve, circumvent, or
transform the symbol grounding problem. Many papers explicitly argue that LLMs
reveal limitations in traditional SGP formulations (especially narrow denotational
semantics assumptions). The debate over whether LLMs require sensorimotor grounding
tests different meta-semantic theories and reveals how the SGP may presuppose
specific views about meaning constitution.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Despite extensive discussion of whether LLMs "understand," few papers rigorously
analyze which specific theory of meaning (use-theory, truth-conditional,
inferentialist, etc.) best captures LLM semantics. The connection to classical
philosophy of language (Frege, Russell, Quine) remains underdeveloped. There's
limited engagement with how LLM architectures (transformers, attention mechanisms)
might instantiate specific semantic theories.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Papers in this domain should be integrated with Domain 1 (classical SGP) to show
how LLMs challenge or vindicate Harnad's original formulation. Compare sensorimotor
grounding arguments here with embodied cognition literature in Domain 3. The
inferentialism discussion (Arai & Tsugawa) connects to Brandom's work and could
bridge to broader debates about use-theories of meaning.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Grounding-Skeptical (8 papers): LLMs demonstrate understanding without sensorimotor grounding; grounding is overrated
- Grounding-Required (5 papers): LLMs lack genuine understanding due to missing grounding; remain "stochastic parrots"
- Alternative-Semantics (5 papers): LLMs require non-referential semantic frameworks (inferentialism, semiotics, fragmentism)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Computational symbol systems face a fundamental problem: symbols manipulated according to syntactic rules are not intrinsically meaningful to the system itself, only to external human interpreters. Harnad argues that purely symbolic AI cannot solve this problem, but hybrid systems combining nonsymbolic (connectionist) sensorimotor grounding with symbolic processing can ground elementary symbols through categorical perception, enabling derived symbolic meanings through symbol-symbol relationships.

  RELEVANCE: This is the canonical formulation of the symbol grounding problem. It establishes the problem space, defines what counts as a solution (intrinsic vs. parasitic meaning), and proposes the hybrid architecture that has dominated subsequent debate. The paper's implicit assumption that symbols require grounding "in" something external to syntax is central to this review's investigation of whether SGP presupposes a particular meta-semantic theory.

Concludes that all eight strategies fail this condition and the SGP remains unsolved.

  RELEVANCE: Major critical survey establishing evaluation criteria for SGP solutions. The zero semantic commitment condition becomes a key litmus test in subsequent debate.

Introduces "Praxical Grounding" where meaning emerges from successful goal-directed actions mediated by symbols in specific contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Represents major alternative to sensorimotor grounding - shifts from perception to action. The action-based approach has affinities with pragmatist and inferentialist semantics in philosophy of language, making it particularly relevant for investigating whether different meta-semantic theories lead to different assessments of SGP. However, critics (Bielecka 2015, Bringsjord 2015, Müller 2015) argue it still smuggles in semantic commitment.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes the "physical" symbol grounding problem - how autonomous agents develop grounded symbols through interaction with the physical world - from Harnad's original formulation. Proposes embodied cognitive science framework where grounding emerges from sensorimotor contingencies and situated interaction rather than being programmed top-down. Emphasizes developmental and evolutionary perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Extends SGP to embodied robotics and developmental systems. The emphasis on physical situatedness and emergent grounding connects to externalist meta-semantics (causal-historical theories). Vogt's framework raises questions about whether symbols need "grounding" at all if meaning is constituted by patterns of embodied activity - a view that challenges the presuppositions of the original problem.

Meaning emerges from coordination games where agents align their conceptual and linguistic systems through repeated communicative success/failure. Proposes moving beyond SGP to study how complex semantic systems emerge.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Directly rebuts Taddeo \& Floridi's praxical solution, arguing it merely demonstrates that robots can connect symbols to percepts and generate sub-human communication, not genuine understanding. The "zero semantic commitment condition" cannot be satisfied by any proposed solution, including action-based semantics. Genuine grounding requires understanding semantic content at the level required for higher cognition (logical reasoning, education), which no current system achieves.

  RELEVANCE: Major skeptical position arguing SGP remains fundamentally unsolved. Raises the bar for what counts as grounding by demanding logical/propositional understanding rather than mere sensorimotor or behavioral success. This connects to debates about whether semantic content requires conceptual capacities (McDowell) or whether nonconceptual content suffices. The critique reveals implicit commitments about the nature of meaning that divide researchers.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that there are multiple distinct "symbol grounding problems" depending on one's understanding of computation and goals. On a proper syntactic understanding of computation, the only sensible grounding problem is how to explain and reproduce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational agents. Taddeo \& Floridi's zero semantic commitment condition cannot be fulfilled by any system, including their own solution. We need to reformulate what problem we're trying to solve.

  RELEVANCE: Meta-level critique questioning whether SGP is well-formulated.

The paper exemplifies how different theoretical commitments (about computation, meaning, goals) shape problem formulation itself - directly relevant to this review's hypothesis that SGP may presuppose unjustified semantic assumptions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Clarifies that computation is purely syntactic symbol manipulation - the symbols are interpretable by us but not intrinsically meaningful to the system. Cognition requires more than computation because meaningful mental states have intrinsic semantic content. This gap between computation and cognition is the heart of the symbol grounding problem. Hybrid systems with sensorimotor capacities can bridge this gap.

  RELEVANCE: Harnad's definitive statement distinguishing computation (syntax) from cognition (semantics). The sharp syntax/semantics distinction presupposed here is questionable from some philosophical perspectives (Wittgensteinian use-theories, inferentialism) where meaning IS constituted by rule-governed symbolic manipulation in context. Examining whether this distinction is theoretically justified is central to evaluating whether SGP is well-posed.

  POSITION: Foundational distinction between computation (syntax) and cognition (semantics). Argues pure computation cannot yield cognition but hybrid systems can ground symbols.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic analysis of Searle's Chinese Room Argument and its implications for AI. While Searle correctly shows purely symbolic computation cannot yield understanding, his argument underestimates the power of hybrid architectures combining symbolic and nonsymbolic processing. Introduces the symbol grounding problem as a framework for understanding what Searle's argument establishes and what it leaves open.

  RELEVANCE: Key precursor to Harnad's 1990 SGP formulation. Shows how SGP emerges from engagement with Searle's Chinese Room - both arguments share the assumption that computational syntax is not sufficient for semantic content. This shared assumption may itself reflect a particular view of semantics (representationalism) that could be challenged by alternative meta-semantic theories.

  POSITION: Interprets Chinese Room as revealing symbol grounding problem. Defends hybrid symbolic/nonsymbolic approach against Searle's blanket rejection of computational approaches to mind.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that LLMs do not fall prey to Harnad's symbol grounding problem because SGP only arises when questionable theories of meaning (denotational semantics, strong representationalism) are presupposed. Traces SGP to the computational theory of mind (CTM) and argues it would only apply to LLMs if we interpreted them as implementing a language of thought or adopted problematic semantic theories. Pragmatic norms of language use suffice for LLM semantics.

  RELEVANCE: Recent philosophical analysis directly supporting this review's central hypothesis - that SGP presupposes a particular (questionable) view of meta-semantics. Gubelmann explicitly identifies denotational semantics and CTM as the problematic assumptions. Proposes pragmatist alternative where meaning is constituted by norms of use rather than grounding relations. This demonstrates how different meta-semantic theories lead to different assessments of whether SGP is genuine.

  POSITION: Pragmatist position arguing SGP does not apply to LLMs because it presupposes flawed semantic theories. Meaning is normatively constituted by use patterns, not grounding in non-linguistic reality.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents formal categorical framework analyzing how humans and LLMs transform content into truth-evaluated propositions about possible worlds. Argues LLMs do not solve but circumvent the symbol grounding problem by operating entirely within the space of linguistic content without grounding in non-linguistic reality. This circumvention is not a failure but a different kind of semantic competence.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Unifies Turing Test, Chinese Room, and SGP as all addressing whether artificial agents can generate human-like meanings. Proposes Meaning Generator System (MGS) framework where systems generate meanings to satisfy internal constraints. For AAs to generate human-like meanings requires transferring human constraints (including "stay alive" constraints rooted in life and consciousness). This reveals fundamental limitations - genuine human-like meaning requires understanding life and consciousness.

The emphasis on constraint-satisfaction and phenomenology aligns with enactivist and phenomenological approaches to meaning. Demonstrates alternative framing where grounding is less central than the nature of constraints that drive meaning-generation. Raises question of whether SGP can be solved without solving consciousness - a meta-theoretical issue about problem dependencies.

Solicited expert commentaries on state of the field.

  RELEVANCE: Balanced assessment identifying genuine progress while acknowledging open problems. The emphasis on symbol-symbol relationships and abstraction highlights that grounding elementary symbols may be insufficient - higher-level semantic competence (compositionality, logical inference) requires additional explanation. This gap between grounded elementary symbols and complex semantic competence is relevant for evaluating whether proposed solutions actually solve the full SGP.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reformulates SGP using Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). Grounding is modeled as information compression - a purely symbolic system cannot ground most "worlds" (data strings) because they are algorithmically random and incompressible. Any statically grounded system is incomplete because adversarial incompressible worlds can be constructed. The "grounding act" requires new information that cannot be inferred from existing code. Proves using Chaitin's theorem that meaning is an open-ended process of overcoming information-theoretic limitations.

  RELEVANCE: Recent formal framework providing information-theoretic perspective on SGP's limits. The proof that complete grounding is impossible for finite systems offers rigorous version of skeptical position. However, the framework assumes representational/computational model of meaning - alternative meta-semantic theories (use-based, normative) might reject the information-theoretic framing entirely. Demonstrates how mathematical formalization depends on prior semantic commitments.

Concludes: (1) current evidence does not support ANS-grounding, (2) continuous variables confound numerosity tasks making pure ANS-symbol association impossible to measure, (3) cognitive control mediates any mapping between ANS and symbols.

  RELEVANCE: Domain-specific analysis of symbol grounding in mathematical cognition. Shows that empirical evidence for dominant grounding theory (ANS mapping) is weak, parallel to broader SGP debate where proposed solutions face empirical and conceptual challenges. The role of cognitive control in mediating grounding suggests higher-level capacities are necessary - supporting views (like Bringsjord's) that mere sensorimotor grounding is insufficient.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Names are rigid designators that refer directly to objects via causal-historical chains, not through associated descriptions. Against Fregean descriptivism, argues modal and epistemological considerations show names pick out the same object in all possible worlds, and that reference is fixed by initial baptism and causal transmission, not by speakers' descriptive beliefs about the referent.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for direct reference theory, which grounds the referentialist metasemantics most naturally aligned with symbol grounding problem formulations. If meaning is direct reference established causally, then symbols require causal connection to what they denote—making SGP central to semantics.

This challenges the Russellian view that descriptions contribute only their semantic content.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes speaker reference vs. semantic reference distinction crucial for assessing grounding requirements. If reference is partly determined by speaker intentions and context rather than purely semantic rules, grounding becomes more complex than simple word-object mapping.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops normative inferentialism—the view that conceptual content is constituted by the inferential role expressions play in reasoning practices, understood as patterns of commitment and entitlement. Meaning is not reference to objects but position in a "space of reasons." Linguistic practice is fundamentally about giving and asking for reasons, and semantic content emerges from these normative, social practices.

  RELEVANCE: Presents the strongest alternative to referentialist metasemantics underlying the symbol grounding problem. If meaning is inferential role rather than denotation, then symbols need not be "grounded" in non-symbolic reality—they are meaningful through their position in inferential networks. This threatens to dissolve SGP or transform it into a question about acquiring appropriate inferential abilities, not world-connections.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops two-dimensional semantic framework combining Kripkean modal semantics with Fregean attention to cognitive significance.

This framework aims to preserve Kripke's insights about necessity and reference while accommodating the role of conceptual content in determining reference.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Russell developed use theory of meaning anticipating Wittgenstein in "The Analysis of Mind" (1921). Understanding utterance is not grasping referent but responding appropriately—meaning is constituted by patterns of use and response, not reference relations. Challenges standard history treating Wittgenstein as originator of use theories.

  RELEVANCE: Historical background for use theories as alternatives to referentialism. If meaning is use pattern rather than reference, symbols might be meaningful through appropriate use competence without grounding in non-symbolic reality. Relevant for whether SGP presupposes referentialist metasemantics rejected by Wittgensteinian and pragmatist traditions.

Meaning is realized when language users follow semantic rules (not syntactic rules) based on context within language games. Argues that rule following is neither mental nor purely behavioral but embedded in practical life and social context.

When meaning is externally determined (Putnam, Burge), speakers can disagree about what their words mean even while using same words. Examines how externalist metasemantics affects philosophical method and nature of conceptual disputes.

  RELEVANCE: Recent work on externalist metasemantics relevant for understanding grounding requirements.

Meaning is constructed through contrast and differentiation rather than inherent identity or reference to universals.

  RELEVANCE: Connects alternative semantic theory to empirical cognitive science, relevant for assessing whether SGP correctly identifies cognitive requirements.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Contrasts referentialist and inferentialist approaches to semantics, examining which better handles pejoratives.

Inferentialist account reverses priority, taking inference rules as fundamental and explaining reference via inferential role. Uses pejoratives as test case for adjudicating between approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Clear statement of referentialism vs. inferentialism contrast using concrete semantic phenomenon.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume systematically distinguishes three dimensions of meta-semantics: (1) basic meta-semantics addressing the grounding question of what non-semantic facts semantic facts supervene on, (2) theory of meaning concerned with the essence or nature of meaning (e.g., whether meaning is normative), and (3) metaphysics of semantic values investigating whether semantic values should be understood in terms of truth and reference or their functional roles. The introduction argues this tripartite division clarifies longstanding confusions in philosophy of language between semantics proper and its foundations.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding contemporary meta-semantic debates. The volume's framework helps evaluate whether the SGP conflates semantic and meta-semantic questions. If the SGP assumes a particular answer to the grounding question (e.g., that reference must be causally grounded), this volume's taxonomy reveals that as one among multiple meta-semantic options. The distinction between semantics and meta-semantics may show the SGP operates at the wrong level of analysis.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses a second-order foundational question: what makes meta-semantic theories themselves true? Defends "meta-internalism"—the view that foundations of reference and meaning are anchored in individual dispositions and psychological states of language users, not broader community-based or external factors. Argues this internalist meta-meta-semantics is compatible with semantic externalism as usually understood and actually explains why externalism is true. Examines reference failure, conceptual engineering, and methodology of reference theories through this lens.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to evaluating the SGP's presuppositions. If meta-internalism is correct, semantic grounding involves psychological states and dispositions—suggesting symbol grounding is indeed a real issue about linking internal states to referents. However, the compatibility with semantic externalism complicates simple "internalism solves grounding" narratives. The book's recent publication (2025) makes it essential for understanding current debates.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditional philosophy of language (Lewis, Grice, Stalnaker) has mistakenly focused on highly idealized linguistic contexts where cooperative agents share the goal of gaining information. This abstracts away from power, ideology, social position, and diversity of goals—factors crucial for explaining semantic and pragmatic phenomena. Keiser proposes a non-ideal foundational theory: language's essential function is to direct attention for achieving diverse social and political goals, not primarily information exchange. This framework is then applied to dog whistling, propaganda, racist speech, silencing, and manipulation.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges whether the SGP's framing assumes idealized, information-theoretic meta-semantics. If Keiser is right that meaning is fundamentally about attention-direction for diverse goals rather than information transmission, the grounding problem may look different—symbols might not need to "stand for" things in a referential sense to be meaningful. Opens space for use-based or pragmatic meta-semantics that could reframe or dissolve traditional grounding worries.

  doi = {10.4148/JHAP.V1I10.1620},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques the orthodox interpretation that David Lewis adopted a theory where predicate meaning is the most natural property consistent with use. Weatherson argues this interpretation, shared by supporters and critics, misrepresents Lewis's actual view. Drawing on Lewis's late work, Weatherson shows Lewis's theory gives naturalness a more nuanced role than the orthodox reading suggests, and that appreciating this strengthens rather than weakens Lewis's meta-semantic account. The paper defends Lewis against charges that reference magnetism leads to implausible semantic results.

  RELEVANCE: Reference magnetism—the idea that natural properties are easier to refer to—is a key meta-semantic proposal for solving indeterminacy problems in reference. If the SGP presupposes referential semantics needs grounding, understanding whether naturalness constrains reference helps evaluate that presupposition. Weatherson's defense of Lewis shows reference magnetism is more sophisticated than critics suggest, but still commits to metaphysical naturalness doing semantic work—a commitment the SGP might share or might avoid.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends reference magnetism as the best solution to Moral Twin Earth thought experiments, which challenge naturalistic normative realism. Argues that (1) normative terms exhibit distinctive semantic stability compared to descriptive terms, and (2) realists need a unified meta-semantic theory explaining this difference. Reference magnetism—the view that some properties are "magnetic" and comparatively easy to refer to—provides such an explanation. Shows how magnetism can smoothly vindicate plausible judgments about semantic stability in normative discourse, though also offers a debunking alternative for those skeptical of realist metaphysics.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how meta-semantic theory connects to broader metaphysical commitments. If normative properties can be reference magnets, this suggests meta-semantic grounding doesn't require causal connections or physical reduction. This complicates the SGP: if reference can be magnetically constrained without causal grounding, perhaps the grounding problem is less pressing than it appears. Alternatively, if magnetism is metaphysically dubious, this strengthens the need for alternative grounding stories.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the reference magnetism hypothesis in meta-semantics—the view that objective naturalness of candidate meanings partly determines which meanings our words have. Argues there is no textual evidence Lewis endorsed this view, and that Lewis's actual account of language provides good reasons against it. Schwarz shows that Lewis's conventionalist framework for language, properly understood, solves indeterminacy problems without appealing to metaphysical naturalness as a semantic constraint. The paper undermines a popular meta-semantic strategy for solving reference determination problems.

  RELEVANCE: If Schwarz is right that reference magnetism is unmotivated, meta-semantics must rely more heavily on use, convention, or intention to fix reference. This would strengthen use-based approaches and potentially support conventionalist responses to the SGP—perhaps symbol grounding is conventional rather than metaphysically constrained. Alternatively, abandoning magnetism might make grounding problems more severe by removing a metaphysical constraint on indeterminacy.

  doi = {10.1007/s11229-020-02868-w},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses what concepts are and how they can be engineered. Criticizes both semanticism (conceptual engineering aims to change linguistic meanings) and psychologism (it aims to change psychological structures) as insufficient. Proposes the "Dual Content View": concepts have both referential content and cognitive content, which are interrelated. Conceptual engineering targets both kinds of content. This view is independently plausible and helps solve difficult problems about what conceptual engineering revises and how such revisions are possible.

  RELEVANCE: Conceptual engineering raises meta-semantic questions about whether and how meanings can be deliberately changed. If concepts can be engineered, this suggests meta-semantic facts are somewhat malleable—challenging views where reference is rigidly determined by causal history or metaphysical naturalness. For the SGP, this raises the question: could we "engineer" symbol grounding by revising our semantic concepts? Or does grounding constrain engineering efforts? The dual content framework suggests engineering must respect both referential and cognitive dimensions.

  doi = {10.1007/s11098-020-01546-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Deutsch's argument that conceptual engineering faces an unsurmountable dilemma: either it revises semantic meanings (but then faces implementation problems) or introduces new technical terms (but then becomes trivial). Koch argues there is a third option neglected by Deutsch: conceptual engineering can target concepts understood as having dual content (both referential and cognitive), making it both implementable and non-trivial. Further argues that even semantic meaning revision is no less feasible than other normative projects we pursue.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates meta-semantic assumptions matter for evaluating the feasibility of meaning revision. If the SGP assumes meanings are fixed by causal-historical chains or natural kinds, engineering seems impossible. But if meanings involve conventions, use patterns, or cognitive structures, they may be revisable. This connects to whether symbol grounding is a fixed metaphysical relation or a practice that can be shaped and revised.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues conceptual engineering requires clarity about what concepts are. Surveys competing views: concepts as mental representations, as meanings, as abilities, as abstract objects.

The paper systematically explores how meta-semantic and metaphysical commitments about concepts constrain engineering methodology.

  RELEVANCE: Makes explicit how meta-semantic theory shapes the conceptual engineering debate. If concepts are abstract Fregean senses, engineering looks different than if concepts are mental representations or abilities. For the SGP, this raises the question: what are symbols, and does the answer determine what grounding could mean? A Fregean might see grounding differently than a mentalist or pragmatist.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends the "Austerity Framework" for conceptual engineering, which embraces radical externalism: the mechanisms underlying conceptual engineering are inscrutable (too complex and unstable to grasp) and largely beyond our control. Responds to critics who claim internalism would avoid these commitments. Argues that internalists must show (a) there are scrutable, controllable inner states, (b) concepts supervene on them, and (c) the determination relation is itself scrutable and controllable—a tall order Cappelen doubts internalists can meet.

  RELEVANCE: Raises fundamental questions about meta-semantic control and transparency. If Cappelen is right that semantic facts are inscrutable and uncontrollable even for speakers themselves, this suggests the SGP may target an impossible explanatory goal. We cannot make semantic facts fully transparent or subject to our control—perhaps symbol grounding is similarly inscrutable. Alternatively, this pessimism might be too strong, and internalist alternatives could show grounding is more tractable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Investigates the distinction between fundamental truths (really or metaphysically true) and derivative truths (true but less fundamental). Develops a rigorous theory showing this distinction is not itself a metaphysical distinction but a device presupposed to express metaphysical distinctions. Drawing on Rayo's anti-Quinean views on ontological commitment, Williams formulates a formal theory of fundamentality. Shows how this dovetails with interpretationist meta-semantics to give content to the idea that some entities (sets, mereological sums) can be "postulated into existence."

  RELEVANCE: Raises deep questions about levels of semantic explanation. If some truths are fundamental and others derivative, perhaps some semantic facts are fundamental (grounded in usage, intentions, causal connections) while others are derivative (constructed through interpretation or convention). This could reframe the SGP: symbol grounding might be derivative rather than fundamental, grounded in more basic practices of symbol use.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a novel meta-semantic strategy: an "endogenous" account where word types are fixed as part of meta-semantics rather than presupposed. Conventions of truthfulness and trust ground not only word meanings (meaning by convention) but also what the word type is for each token utterance (words by convention). The same treatment extends to identifying populations through which conventions prevail. Argues this does not create new underdetermination problems for meta-semantics, contrary to what might be expected.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the typical meta-semantic assumption that word types are part of the non-semantic base. If both word identities and meanings are conventional, this suggests a more holistic, less foundationalist approach to semantics. For the SGP, this raises whether "symbols" and their "meanings" can both be products of grounding practices rather than one grounding the other. The conventionalist framework might suggest symbol grounding is internally constituted by practices rather than externally determined by causal relations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Carnapian explication—replacing a vague or unclear concept with a more precise one—as a method of conceptual re-engineering. Distinguishes explication from conceptual analysis (which aims to capture existing meaning) and stipulation (which simply introduces new meaning). Argues explication involves both descriptive and normative elements: it must be similar enough to the explicandum to count as replacing it, but improved enough to serve theoretical purposes. Develops constraints on successful explication and its role in philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: Explication provides a framework for thinking about how symbols could be "grounded" through systematic refinement. Rather than a one-step causal link, grounding might involve iterative explication where vague symbol-world connections are progressively sharpened. This process-oriented view contrasts with snapshot models of reference determination. For the SGP, this suggests grounding might be an ongoing engineering project rather than a fixed metaphysical relation requiring explanation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically assesses the "Expertise Defense"—the claim that philosophers' semantic intuitions about reference are more reliable than laypeople's intuitions. Focusing on proper name reference intuitions (Kripkean causal-historical vs. Fregean descriptivist), Machery examines whether philosophical expertise genuinely improves intuition reliability. Finds little empirical evidence supporting the Expertise Defense, raising methodological questions about how semantic theories should be tested and what role intuitions should play in meta-semantic theorizing.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the evidential basis for competing meta-semantic theories. If expert intuitions about reference are no more reliable than folk intuitions, this undermines one methodology for adjudicating between meta-semantic views. For the SGP, this raises: whose intuitions about symbol grounding count? Cognitive scientists', philosophers', AI researchers'? The lack of privileged expert intuitions might explain why grounding debates are so persistent—there's no neutral intuitive ground to stand on.

These interact but should be kept analytically distinct. The paper surveys major metasemantic theories and argues for their independence from semantic theories proper.

Perhaps the grounding problem conflates semantic grounding (what makes symbols have meanings) with pragmatic grounding (what makes symbol uses mean things). If so, different solutions might apply at each level. Conventional symbols might be semantically grounded one way (e.g., in community practices) while pragmatically grounded another way (e.g., in speaker intentions).

This metasemantic account handles disagreement and retraction data that motivates relativist semantics, but without relativism's controversial commitments. Speaker behaviors like retracting previous assertions play a role in making past utterances have their meanings. Challenges the assumption that utterance meaning is fixed at time of utterance.

  RELEVANCE: Radically reconceptualizes how content gets determined, extending externalism temporally. For the SGP, this suggests symbol grounding might not be temporally local—what grounds a symbol's meaning might include future practices and dispositions, not just past causal history or current usage. This challenges static pictures of grounding and suggests meaning determination is more dynamic and holistic than the SGP might assume.

  POSITION: Temporal externalism in metasemantics, defending metasemantic rather than relativist semantic account of disagreement and retraction.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Cappelen's claim that internalist metasemantics fares no better than externalism regarding scrutability and control in conceptual engineering. Argues internalist conceptual role theories of content can meet Cappelen's challenge by showing: (a) there are scrutable, controllable inner states (conceptual roles), (b) contents supervene on these, and (c) the determination relation is scrutable and controllable. Defends internalism as providing more tractable foundations for conceptual engineering than externalism.

  RELEVANCE: Bears directly on whether symbol grounding can be understood internalistically. If Pollock succeeds in defending internalist metasemantics, this suggests symbol meanings could be grounded in internal conceptual roles rather than external causal-referential relations—potentially offering a different solution space for the SGP. However, if Cappelen is right that internalism fails to deliver scrutability and control, grounding might be inscrutable from both internalist and externalist perspectives.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle presents the Chinese Room thought experiment to argue that syntactic symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine semantic understanding. A person following rules to manipulate Chinese symbols could pass the Turing test without understanding Chinese, demonstrating that programs cannot produce intentionality. The argument targets "Strong AI" - the claim that appropriately programmed computers literally understand language.

  RELEVANCE: This is the canonical statement of the computational challenge to symbol grounding. Searle argues that formal symbols lack intrinsic intentionality - they are only meaningful relative to observers. This directly raises the meta-semantic question of what grounds meaning, suggesting biological processes rather than computation. The Chinese Room has structured decades of debate about whether computational systems can have genuine intentionality, making it essential for understanding philosophical engagement with the SGP.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle develops his biological naturalism, arguing that consciousness and intentionality are caused by neurobiological processes but cannot be reduced to or identified with computational states. He criticizes both dualism and computational functionalism, arguing that first-person ontology of consciousness is irreducible to third-person descriptions. Mental phenomena are higher-level features of brain processes, analogous to how liquidity is a feature of H2O molecules.

  RELEVANCE: Provides Searle's positive account of intentionality to complement the negative Chinese Room argument. His biological naturalism suggests that symbol grounding requires specific biological substrate, not just functional organization. This raises the question whether the SGP implicitly assumes substrate-independence (a computational assumption Searle rejects). The work clarifies what Searle thinks IS required for genuine intentionality beyond syntax.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fodor defends a computational-representational theory of mind (CRTM) while attempting to naturalize mental content through asymmetric causal dependency. Mental representations get their content from reliable causal connections to worldly properties, where the connection to veridical instances asymmetrically depends on connections to non-veridical instances. This asymmetry distinguishes representation from mere correlation and addresses the disjunction problem for informational semantics.

  RELEVANCE: Presents a major attempt to provide naturalistic semantics compatible with computational theories of mind - directly relevant to whether computational symbol manipulation can ground meaning. Fodor's account suggests symbols CAN have non-derived content if properly causally connected to the world, offering an externalist meta-semantics that might challenge narrow formulations of the SGP. However, his reliance on asymmetric dependence has been widely criticized.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dretske develops his representational theory of consciousness, arguing that phenomenal experience consists in the awareness of representational content, where representation is naturalized through informational relations. Mental states acquire content through indicator functions developed through learning, where C-fibers firing means "tissue damage" because they reliably carry information about damage. Consciousness is the process of becoming aware of information the mind already represents.

  RELEVANCE: Offers an influential naturalistic account of intentionality based on information theory, providing resources for grounding symbol meaning in causal-informational relations with the environment. Like Fodor but with different details, Dretske suggests externalist paths to naturalizing content that might dissolve the SGP if symbols are understood as embedded in information-carrying systems. His account addresses how representation can arise from non-representational physical processes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Millikan develops teleosemantics, arguing that mental and linguistic content is grounded in proper functions shaped by natural selection. A representation's content is determined by what it was selected to indicate or bring about. Mental states have their content in virtue of evolutionary history - they mean what their ancestors were selected for representing. This provides a naturalistic, non-magical account of intentionality based on biological function rather than current causal relations.

  RELEVANCE: Teleosemantics offers a distinctive naturalistic alternative to causal-informational theories, with important implications for symbol grounding. Millikan's view suggests that isolated symbols manipulated in computation lack content because they lack proper functions - content requires historical-functional relations that artificial systems don't possess. However, one could argue that linguistic symbols acquire derived proper functions through cultural evolution. Her work raises the question whether the SGP presupposes anti-teleological meta-semantics.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Through thought experiments involving arthritis and other concepts, Burge argues that mental content is not determined solely by internal physical states but depends on social-linguistic community. An individual who misunderstands "arthritis" (thinking it can occur in the thigh) has different mental states than a duplicate in a community where "arthritis" has broader meaning. This establishes anti-individualism: mental contents are individuated by social-environmental factors external to the subject.

  RELEVANCE: Burge's externalism has profound implications for the symbol grounding problem. If content is partly constituted by social-linguistic practices external to individual cognition, then the SGP's focus on individual cognitive systems may be misdirected. Symbols might be grounded not in individual minds but in communal practices. This suggests the SGP may presuppose individualism - a contentious meta-semantic assumption. Burge's work opens space for social externalist solutions to grounding.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190863807.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendelovici defends phenomenal intentionality theory (PIT), arguing that phenomenal consciousness is the basis of all intentionality. Mental states have their content in virtue of what it's like to be in them - there is something it's like to think about Paris, and this phenomenology constitutes the state's aboutness. She addresses challenges about unconscious intentionality by arguing we only derivatively represent such contents by self-ascription. This radically internalist view makes intentionality intrinsic to phenomenology.

  RELEVANCE: PIT offers a non-naturalistic alternative to causal and functional theories, with striking implications for symbol grounding. If intentionality requires phenomenal consciousness, then purely computational symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine meaning - supporting Searle-style conclusions but from phenomenological rather than biological grounds. This raises the question whether the SGP presupposes that phenomenology is explanatorily idle (eliminativism about qualia), which PIT theorists reject. Mendelovici's internalism contrasts sharply with Burge's externalism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Grindrod argues that LLMs like GPT can have genuine linguistic intentionality despite lacking mental intentionality. Drawing on Evans's account of naming practices and Millikan's teleosemantics, he argues that linguistic content depends on integration into pre-existing linguistic systems and practices, not on speaker psychology. LLM outputs can be meaningful because they participate in established linguistic conventions, even though the models lack beliefs or phenomenology. This separates linguistic from mental intentionality.

  RELEVANCE: This recent paper directly connects classical philosophy of mind to contemporary AI, addressing whether statistical language models can have genuine intentional content. Grindrod suggests that focusing on mental intentionality misses how linguistic meaning works - language gets meaning from social practices, not individual minds. This externalist approach offers novel resources for addressing symbol grounding in LLMs, suggesting the SGP may have conflated linguistic and mental intentionality. The paper demonstrates how meta-semantic theory matters for evaluating AI systems.

  year = {2003},
  pages = {229--258},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Loar argues that phenomenal states have an intrinsic, non-derivative kind of intentionality that grounds all other intentionality. The phenomenology of thinking about water itself constitutes that thought's aboutness, not external relations to H2O. This phenomenal intentionality is conceptually and metaphysically prior to any naturalistic reduction - it's a primitive feature of conscious experience. Loar contrasts this with Burge's externalism, arguing that phenomenology individuates content more fundamentally than environmental factors.

  RELEVANCE: Loar's paper is foundational for phenomenal intentionality theory and directly challenges externalist meta-semantics like Burge's. For the SGP, this raises crucial questions about what kind of intentionality needs grounding. If phenomenal intentionality is primitive, then the search for naturalistic grounding conditions may be misguided - intentionality might be irreducible. However, this would suggest symbols lacking phenomenology cannot have intrinsic intentionality, supporting Searle's conclusions. Loar's view represents an important non-naturalist strand in the debate.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kriegel systematizes phenomenal intentionality theory as a research program, identifying core theses: (1) some mental states have phenomenal intentionality, (2) phenomenal intentionality is the most fundamental kind, (3) other forms of intentionality derive from it. He distinguishes stronger and weaker versions and addresses key challenges, particularly accounting for unconscious intentional states. The program aims to ground all intentionality in consciousness while remaining compatible with physicalism through emergentist or functionalist accounts of phenomenology.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a systematic overview of how phenomenal intentionality theory addresses the grounding problem for meaning. For the SGP, the program suggests that computational symbol manipulation cannot constitute basic intentionality because it lacks phenomenology. However, symbols might have derived intentionality through relations to phenomenally conscious users. This framework helps clarify what assumptions about the nature of intentionality are in play when formulating the SGP - whether original or derived intentionality is at issue.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Neander defends teleosemantics against objections, arguing that mental content is determined by informational proper functions - what a mechanism was selected to indicate. She addresses the swampman problem, indeterminacy worries, and disjunction problems while arguing teleosemantics provides the best naturalistic account of content. Mental representation requires both information-carrying and having the proper function of carrying that information, where proper functions are fixed by selection history.

  RELEVANCE: Neander's sophisticated defense of teleosemantics clarifies how biological function grounds content, with implications for artificial systems. If content requires selection history, then engineered symbols lack intrinsic intentionality unless they acquire derived functions through cultural/technological evolution. This suggests the SGP might dissolve if we recognize that linguistic symbols have culturally-evolved proper functions rather than requiring grounding in individual minds. Her work helps assess whether the SGP presupposes anti-functionalist or anti-teleological meta-semantics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Horgan argues for a strong version of phenomenal intentionality theory: all original (non-derived) intentionality is phenomenal intentionality. Unconscious states with apparent intentionality either (a) aren't genuinely intentional, or (b) have only derived intentionality borrowed from phenomenally conscious states, or (c) have narrow phenomenal character below the threshold of access consciousness. This eliminates any competition between phenomenal and non-phenomenal accounts of basic intentionality.

  RELEVANCE: Horgan's strong claim that original intentionality requires phenomenology has direct implications for symbol grounding. Computational symbols, lacking phenomenology, cannot have original intentionality on this view - they can only have derived intentionality through relations to conscious agents. This supports Searle-style arguments against computational semantics but from phenomenological rather than biological grounds. The position raises questions about whether the SGP presupposes that non-phenomenal states can have original intentionality.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Chalmers argues that phenomenal experience has representational content - there is phenomenal content that represents the world. He defends this against pure qualia views while remaining neutral on whether phenomenology exhausts representation. Chalmers develops the notion of Edenic content (content that cannot mislead) and argues phenomenal states represent properties as being instantiated in experience. This mediates between phenomenal intentionality views and purely informational accounts.

  RELEVANCE: Chalmers's account of phenomenal representation provides a middle ground between purely externalist and purely phenomenological approaches to intentionality. For the SGP, this suggests that representation requires phenomenal character but that character itself has representational structure. This complicates simple dichotomies between computational and phenomenal approaches - even if symbols need grounding in phenomenology, that phenomenology may have representational structure explicable in functional terms. Relevant for nuanced understanding of the consciousness-intentionality connection.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Crane defends the intentionality of thought against reductivist and eliminativist views, arguing that intentionality is a genuine, irreducible feature of mentality. He develops an "actualist" account where intentional states are relations to actually existing intentional contents (which may be non-existent objects), rather than relations to existing objects. This allows mental states to be genuinely about non-existent things without committing to Meinongian ontology.

  RELEVANCE: Crane's account addresses puzzles about how mental states can be about non-existent or abstract objects, relevant for understanding what conditions must be met for symbols to genuinely refer. His rejection of naturalistic reduction of intentionality suggests that attempts to ground symbol meaning in purely causal-physical terms may be misguided - intentionality may be a sui generis feature requiring different explanatory resources.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pitt defends the view that propositional attitudes like beliefs have distinctive phenomenal character and that this phenomenal character constitutes their content. Thinking that Paris is beautiful is identical to a particular phenomenal state - the thought's content just is its phenomenology. This hardcore phenomenal intentionality view rejects any derivative or non-phenomenal intentionality, arguing all genuine intentionality is phenomenal.

  RELEVANCE: Pitt's extreme phenomenal intentionality view has radical implications for symbol grounding. If thought content is identical to phenomenology, then computational symbols manipulated without phenomenology cannot have any genuine intentionality, not even derived intentionality. This strongly supports Searle-style conclusions but raises questions about whether this makes intentionality explanatorily mysterious. The view represents the strongest challenge to computational semantics from phenomenology, relevant for understanding the full range of meta-semantic positions bearing on the SGP.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Martínez addresses whether teleosemantics can account for the productivity and systematicity of thought - the capacity to entertain novel combinations of concepts.

The paper defends teleosemantics against a key objection from cognitive architecture.

  RELEVANCE: Productivity is central to human language and cognition, and if teleosemantics cannot explain it, this limits its adequacy for addressing symbol grounding. Martínez's defense suggests that biologically-grounded content can be compositional and productive, addressing worries that teleosemantics is too rigid for language. This bears on whether biological grounding (as opposed to computational grounding) can explain linguistic capacity - relevant for assessing whether the SGP presupposes computational meta-semantics.

Brentano's view that intentionality is intrinsic to mental acts (not a relation to external objects) anticipates phenomenal intentionality theories and contrasts with externalist causal theories.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a theoretical framework for understanding AI
  capabilities along three dimensions: self-learning, generalization, and
  semantic grounding. Argues that the symbol grounding problem represents one
  axis of this state space but should be understood alongside other dimensions
  of AI competence. The paper connects classical philosophical issues (Chinese
  Room, SGP, use theories of meaning) to contemporary AI architectures and
  capabilities, arguing for a multidimensional rather than binary conception of
  artificial intelligence.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conceptual framework situating the SGP within a broader
  space of AI capabilities and philosophical issues. By treating semantic
  grounding as one dimension among others, Lyre's approach questions whether
  the SGP should be seen as a singular, foundational problem or as one aspect
  of a more complex space of challenges. This meta-theoretical perspective is
  relevant to assessing whether the problem's standard formulation appropriately
  captures what matters for artificial semantic competence.

  POSITION: Integrative framework treating semantic grounding as one dimension
  of AI state space rather than isolated foundational problem.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that embodied cognition theories, which attempt to
  ground meaning in sensorimotor experience, face serious challenges when
  accounting for abstract concepts that lack clear perceptual referents (e.g.,
  "justice," "democracy," "infinity"). Dove identifies three "ungrounding
  problems" for abstract concepts: (1) how they can be represented without
  sensorimotor content, (2) how they relate to concrete concepts, (3) how
  language might provide an alternative grounding. He suggests that purely
  embodied approaches are insufficient and that linguistic/symbolic
  representation plays an irreducible role.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on embodied cognition rather than AI, Dove's
  argument is highly relevant to assessing whether sensorimotor grounding
  (Harnad's proposed solution) can account for the full range of human
  semantic competence. If abstract concepts require linguistic grounding, this
  suggests that Harnad's framework may be too narrow, supporting the project's
  hypothesis that the SGP presupposes particular assumptions about how meaning
  works. The paper shows that the grounding question extends beyond AI to human
  cognition.

  grounding insufficient for abstract concepts; suggests linguistic grounding
  necessary.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chalmers argues that in principle there can be "pure thinkers"—beings capable of thought without any capacity for sensation—thereby challenging the widespread assumption that sensorimotor grounding is necessary for understanding. He applies this to LLMs, arguing that while he does not directly claim LLMs think or understand, the argument from sensory grounding fails to establish they cannot. He explores how sensory grounding may enhance but not enable cognitive capacities, drawing on recent results about LLM world models and compositional abilities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses a central question for the SGP: whether grounding in sensorimotor experience is constitutive of meaning or merely facilitates it. If Chalmers is correct that pure thinkers are possible, then Harnad's original SGP may presuppose an unnecessarily strong empiricist or embodied cognition thesis. The paper provides a high-profile philosophical defense of the possibility that LLMs ground symbols through linguistic patterns alone, challenging the assumption that "symbols" must be grounded in perception-action loops. This opens space for non-embodied theories of semantic grounding.

  POSITION: Grounding-skeptical; argues sensorimotor grounding is not necessary for thought, though it may enhance thinking. Provides philosophical framework for evaluating LLM understanding claims independent of embodiment requirements.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Havlík challenges the prevailing view that LLMs merely manipulate syntax without understanding and argues that "semantic fragmentism" offers a viable account of how LLMs ground meaning. He contends that successful understanding does not depend primarily on referential grounding (connecting symbols to world states) but can emerge from holistic patterns of use across linguistic contexts. LLMs ground meanings through relationships among linguistic expressions themselves, forming a web of semantic dependencies that constitutes genuine understanding, albeit different from human understanding.

  RELEVANCE: This paper offers an alternative to both traditional referential grounding and embodied cognition approaches to the SGP. Semantic fragmentism suggests that grounding can occur within language itself through pattern consistency, without requiring external sensorimotor anchors. This directly challenges Harnad's assumption that symbol meaning must ultimately connect to "transduction" of sensory signals. The view aligns with holistic and inferentialist semantics in philosophy of language, suggesting the SGP may presuppose an overly narrow picture of how meaning arises.

  POSITION: Alternative-semantics position; defends non-referential grounding through semantic fragmentism. Argues LLMs achieve a form of understanding through linguistic coherence patterns rather than world-referential grounding.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lyre proposes a three-dimensional framework for semantic grounding consisting of functional grounding (behavioral success), social grounding (normative correctness in linguistic practices), and causal grounding (world model development). He argues that LLMs show basic evidence in all three dimensions, particularly through their development of implicit world models revealed by mechanistic interpretability studies. The paper contends LLMs are neither "stochastic parrots" (mere statistical pattern matchers) nor "semantic zombies" (behaviorally adequate but lacking understanding), but rather possess elementary semantic understanding.

  RELEVANCE: Lyre's tripartite grounding framework offers a more nuanced alternative to binary grounding debates. Rather than asking whether LLMs are grounded or not, he distinguishes types of grounding and shows LLMs exhibit grounding along multiple dimensions. This challenges the SGP's typical focus on causal-perceptual grounding alone. The appeal to world models as evidence of causal grounding connects to debates about whether internal representations constitute genuine aboutness. The framework could help disambiguate different senses of "grounding" that run together in SGP discussions.

  POSITION: Grounding-skeptical but nuanced; argues for gradual, multidimensional grounding rather than binary presence/absence. Defends LLM elementary understanding through functional, social, and causal grounding.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper explores whether Brandomian inferential semantics provides a better foundational framework for understanding LLMs than traditional distributional or representational semantics. The authors argue that LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties: they process language through inference, substitution, and anaphora patterns (ISA approach) without requiring reference to external world representations. They develop a "consensus theory of truth" for LLMs based on RLHF mechanisms and argue LLMs challenge traditional assumptions including strict compositionality and semantic externalism.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly engages the question of which meta-semantic theory best captures LLM meaning-making. If inferentialism fits LLMs better than referentialism, this suggests the SGP's focus on reference and denotation may be misplaced. Brandom's inferentialism grounds meaning in patterns of inferential role and social-normative practices rather than word-world reference relations. The paper thus challenges the assumption that solving the SGP requires establishing referential connections to external entities. It opens the question of whether Harnad's formulation presupposes a representationalist meta-semantics that LLMs reveal to be optional.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language, the authors argue that genuine communication requires "constancy" in maintaining reference points through agreement in both definitions and judgments. LLMs lack the constancy needed to track negations and contradictions throughout dialogue, disrupting the reference points necessary for genuine communication. The apparent understanding in human-LLM interaction arises from a "bewitchment": the interaction between LLMs' statistical adherence to linguistic patterns and humans' tendency to follow familiar language games while assuming understanding until proven otherwise.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a sophisticated Wittgensteinian critique of claims that LLMs solve the grounding problem. The focus on "constancy" and ability to track commitments adds a pragmatic dimension to grounding discussions often missing from purely semantic analyses. If successful communication requires maintaining reference across dialogue turns, and LLMs cannot do this reliably, then they lack a crucial aspect of grounding even if they produce locally coherent responses. The analysis suggests grounding may involve more than semantic content—it requires dialectical stability and commitment-tracking.

  POSITION: Grounding-required; argues LLMs lack genuine communication capacity due to inconsistency in maintaining reference and tracking commitments. Wittgensteinian framework emphasizes pragmatic aspects of grounding beyond semantic content.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Picca argues for a semiotic rather than cognitive framework for understanding LLMs, drawing on Peircean sign theory. LLMs should not be understood as minds that "understand" language but as semiotic agents that recombine, recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic associations. Their primary function is manipulating signs to generate plausible rather than truthful text. This semiotic perspective avoids anthropomorphism and better captures how LLMs participate in cultural meaning-making processes not through thinking but through interpretive acts open to contextual negotiation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper offers a third way beyond "LLMs understand" vs "LLMs don't understand" debates by reframing the question entirely. From a semiotic perspective, the SGP's focus on grounding symbols in perceptual states may miss how signs function in broader cultural ecologies of meaning. Signs gain meaning through their place in systems of signs and interpretive practices, not necessarily through reference to external objects. This challenges whether "grounding" is even the right concept for analyzing LLM semantics, suggesting instead a framework of sign circulation and contextual interpretation.

  POSITION: Alternative-semantics; argues for semiotic rather than cognitive/semantic analysis of LLMs. Challenges whether grounding framework is appropriate for understanding sign-manipulating systems.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dove argues that human cognition exhibits capabilities fitting both embodied and artificial intelligence approaches, challenging simple dichotomies. Evidence suggests semantic memory is partially grounded in sensorimotor systems but also dependent on language-specific learning. LLMs demonstrate the richness of language as a source of semantic information, showing how linguistic experience might scaffold and extend our capacity for meaning. In the context of an embodied mind, language provides access to a valuable form of "ungrounded cognition"—genuine cognitive content not requiring direct sensorimotor grounding.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges embodied cognition and LLM research, arguing both sensorimotor grounding and linguistic patterns contribute to human semantic understanding. The concept of "ungrounded cognition" as a legitimate cognitive capacity challenges the assumption that all meaningful representation must ultimately ground in perception-action loops. For the SGP, this suggests a more complex picture where some semantic content may be genuinely grounded in linguistic structure alone while other content requires embodied grounding. This nuanced position undermines both strong embodiment theses and pure symbolic AI approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review paper examines LLMs in relation to classic debates in philosophy of cognitive science, AI, and linguistics. The authors argue that LLM success challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks, particularly regarding compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, and grounding. They systematically analyze how LLMs relate to debates about world models, transmission of cultural knowledge, and the nature of linguistic understanding, while highlighting the need for empirical investigation of internal mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides essential context for understanding how LLMs relate to historical philosophy of AI debates, including the SGP. The authors show that many classical objections to neural networks (lack of compositionality, inability to learn language structure, absence of systematic semantic competence) no longer clearly apply to modern LLMs, forcing reconsideration of what "grounding" and "understanding" require. The paper bridges historical debates (Searle, Fodor, Harnad) with contemporary LLM capabilities, making it crucial for situating the SGP in light of recent developments.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Quigley and Maynard recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across multiple desiderata indexed by evaluation tuples (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution). They propose six dimensions: authenticity, preservation, faithfulness (both correlational and etiological), robustness, and compositionality. Applying this framework to symbolic systems, LLMs, and human language reveals different grounding profiles. LLMs show correlational faithfulness for linguistic tasks but lack etiological warrant for world tasks without grounded interaction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper offers a sophisticated framework for moving beyond binary grounding debates to fine-grained analysis of different grounding dimensions. Rather than asking "are LLMs grounded?" it asks along which dimensions and to what degree they exhibit grounding properties. This aligns with the hypothesis that the SGP may presuppose overly simple grounding criteria. The framework reveals that different semantic theories may emphasize different grounding dimensions, helping to clarify what's at stake in grounding debates and potentially showing the SGP conflates distinct issues.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Oka develops benchmark tasks to empirically evaluate whether modern LLMs possess cognitive capacities required to address the Frame Problem and Symbol Grounding Problem—two fundamental challenges historically viewed as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI. Testing 13 LLMs under zero-shot conditions reveals that while open-source models show variable performance, several closed models achieve high scores on tasks reflecting contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides rare empirical data on how well LLMs perform on tasks specifically designed to test grounding and frame problem capacities. The finding that some LLMs perform well challenges claims that these problems are insurmountable for artificial systems and suggests either (a) LLMs have developed genuine solutions or (b) the benchmark tasks don't fully capture the philosophical problems. Either way, the results complicate simple dismissals of LLM semantic capacities and provide concrete test cases for evaluating grounding theories.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Baggio and Murphy respond to externalist arguments (Mandelkern & Linzen) that LLM words can refer because they participate in causal chains of usage tracing back to referents. They argue from an internalist perspective that reference requires more than causal-historical connections—it requires internal cognitive structures that determine reference independently of external causal chains. LLMs lack the cognitive architecture necessary for genuine reference, even if their outputs are causally connected to human linguistic practices.

  RELEVANCE: This paper clarifies the debate between externalist and internalist accounts of reference and their implications for LLM semantics. If externalism is correct, LLMs might inherit reference through causal connections to human language users; if internalism is correct, LLMs lack the internal structures necessary for reference. This connects directly to whether the SGP requires internal grounding (cognitive states determining reference) or external grounding (causal connections to referents). The debate reveals that positions on LLM grounding often reflect deeper commitments about the nature of reference itself.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Søgaard systematically analyzes five standard philosophical positions on whether language models have semantics, examining their theoretical commitments and empirical implications. The paper maps how different semantic theories (correspondence, coherence, pragmatic, inferentialist, and deflationary accounts) lead to different verdicts about LLM semantic capacity. It shows that debates about LLM semantics often reflect deeper disagreements about what semantics is rather than merely empirical questions about LLM capabilities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper clarifies that "do LLMs have semantics?" and "do LLMs solve the grounding problem?" are not purely empirical questions but depend on background theoretical commitments about meaning. Different semantic theories have different grounding requirements: correspondence theories require reference to world states, coherence theories require internal consistency, inferentialist theories require inferential role patterns, etc. The SGP's formulation may presuppose a particular semantic theory (likely correspondence-based), and alternative theories might yield different grounding requirements or dissolve the problem altogether.

He argues that examining how LLMs internally represent and process language (through embeddings, attention mechanisms, layer representations) alongside classical semantic frameworks provides a more nuanced picture of their semantic capabilities. The analysis suggests LLMs possess structured semantic representations that partially align with formal semantic theories, though with important differences from human semantic processing.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges classical formal semantics (Frege's sense/reference distinction, Russell's theory of descriptions) with LLM computational mechanisms. It tests whether traditional semantic frameworks designed for human language apply to LLM representations, revealing both continuities and divergences. For the SGP, this matters because it addresses whether LLM internal representations have the structure required for genuine semantic content according to established theories, or whether they require fundamentally new semantic frameworks.

They challenge traditional embodied cognition views emphasizing sensorimotor grounding and argue that LLMs simulate meaning-making processes through statistical patterns and relational coherence within language, demonstrating operational understanding rivaling some aspects of human cognition. The paper analyzes LLM performance on medical licensing exams and multilingual tasks as evidence for disembodied semantic competence.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly challenges strong embodied cognition theses requiring sensorimotor grounding for all meaning. If coherence-based semantics suffices for understanding, then the SGP's emphasis on perceptual grounding may be misplaced. The empirical focus on high-stakes tasks (medical exams) where LLMs perform well provides concrete test cases. The argument suggests a revisionist account where "grounding" means coherence within a representational system rather than necessary connection to sensorimotor experience.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This influential paper argues that large language models are "stochastic parrots"—systems that mimic linguistic form without genuine understanding of meaning. The authors contend that LLMs lack grounding in communicative intent, social context, and real-world meaning, instead operating purely through statistical pattern matching. They raise concerns about environmental costs, training data biases, and risks of deploying systems that appear competent without genuine comprehension. The metaphor "stochastic parrot" captures the idea of fluent reproduction without understanding.

  RELEVANCE: This paper has become a central reference point in debates about LLM meaning and grounding. The "stochastic parrot" critique directly invokes grounding concerns: parrots produce sounds mimicking speech without understanding, just as LLMs might produce text mimicking meaning without semantic grounding. Several subsequent papers explicitly respond to this characterization, either defending it (LLMs lack grounding) or challenging it (LLMs exhibit more than mere pattern matching). For the SGP, the debate clarifies whether statistical learning from linguistic data suffices for grounding or whether additional anchoring (sensorimotor, social, causal) is required.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Koch defends LLM referential capacity against the "stochastic parrots" critique using Kripke's causal theory of reference. He argues that if reference is established through causal-historical chains connecting name uses to initial baptisms, then LLM uses of names inherit reference through causal connections to the training data (which itself connects to human reference practices). LLMs can thus genuinely refer to entities like "Peano" through participation in the broader causal network of name usage, even without direct perceptual contact or understanding of referents.

  RELEVANCE: This paper applies Kripkean externalist semantics to defend LLM reference, challenging internalist grounding requirements. If successful, it shows that reference (a key aspect of grounding) doesn't require internal cognitive states or sensorimotor contact—causal-historical connection suffices. This has direct implications for the SGP: if reference can be inherited through linguistic participation in causal chains, then symbols can be "grounded" (referentially connected to world) without the symbol-user having perceptual grounding. The debate reveals whether the SGP requires agent-level grounding or can be satisfied by system-level participation in grounding practices.

  POSITION: Grounding-skeptical via externalist semantics; argues LLMs can refer through causal-historical connections despite lacking internal grounding or perceptual contact with referents.

  year = {2023},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harnad, the original formulator of the symbol grounding problem, applies his framework to contemporary LLMs. He argues that while LLMs like ChatGPT perform surprisingly well on many language tasks, this success derives from scale-emergent properties ("benign biases") inherent in language at LLM scale rather than genuine grounding. These biases arise from the nature of language itself—its redundancy, context-sensitivity, compositional structure—and help LLMs approximate meaningful behavior. However, ChatGPT still lacks direct sensorimotor grounding to connect words to their referents and propositions to their meanings, limiting its understanding.

  RELEVANCE: As the originator of the SGP, Harnad's assessment of LLMs carries particular weight. His view that LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities without solving the grounding problem maintains his original position that symbolic processing requires sensorimotor anchoring for genuine understanding. However, his recognition that LLMs do better than expected due to language structure suggests the SGP formulation may need refinement to account for how much can be achieved through linguistic patterns alone. The paper exemplifies how the SGP debate has evolved to accommodate empirical findings about LLM capabilities while maintaining the basic grounding requirement.

  POSITION: Grounding-required (original SGP formulator); acknowledges LLM capabilities but maintains they lack genuine grounding in sensorimotor experience. Attributes success to scale-emergent linguistic properties rather than understanding.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Poibeau offers a critical interdisciplinary exploration of LLMs examining how they reshape understanding of language, cognition, and society. Drawing on philosophy of language, linguistics, cognitive science, and AI ethics, he investigates how LLMs generate meaning, simulate reasoning, and perform tasks once deemed uniquely human. The book interrogates epistemic, ethical, and political dimensions while exploring LLM limitations (biases, embedded assumptions) and their role in automation and misinformation. It prompts fundamental questions: What is understanding? What is creativity? How do we ascribe agency in synthetic language contexts?

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive treatment situates LLM meaning questions within broader philosophical, cognitive, and social contexts. For the SGP, it's valuable because it examines not just whether LLMs are grounded but what kind of entities they are and how their meaning-making relates to human practices. The interdisciplinary approach reveals that grounding questions cannot be isolated from issues of agency, creativity, and social embedding of meaning. The work helps contextualize the SGP within contemporary debates about AI's place in human cognitive and social ecology.

  POSITION: Comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis; explores LLM meaning across philosophical, ethical, and social dimensions. Questions foundational assumptions about understanding and meaning in synthetic systems.
