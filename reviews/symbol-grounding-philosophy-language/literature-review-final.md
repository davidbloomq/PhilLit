## Introduction

The symbol grounding problem asks a deceptively simple question: how do the symbols manipulated by computational systems acquire meaning that is intrinsic to those systems rather than parasitic on external human interpretation? Harnad (1990) crystallized this challenge by observing that purely symbolic systems face an infinite regress analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese-only dictionary. Symbols defined only in terms of other symbols remain semantically empty unless some are grounded in something beyond the symbolic realm itself. This formulation emerged directly from engagement with Searle's (1980) Chinese Room argument, which purported to demonstrate that syntactic manipulation could never constitute semantic understanding. Where Searle drew skeptical conclusions about artificial intelligence entirely, Harnad proposed a constructive response: hybrid systems combining symbolic processing with sensorimotor grounding might break the regress.

Yet the problem's very formulation embeds substantive assumptions about the nature of meaning. This review investigates whether the symbol grounding problem presupposes a particular meta-semantic framework that philosophers of language have contested. Three central questions guide this investigation. First, do philosophers of language genuinely engage with the symbol grounding problem, or do they find its framing theoretically problematic from the outset? Second, does the problem presuppose a narrow meta-semantic view---specifically, a denotational or referentialist semantics where meaning fundamentally consists in word-world relations requiring causal grounding? Third, where has philosophical discussion of the symbol grounding problem gone, particularly in light of recent developments in artificial intelligence?

Taddeo and Floridi (2005) provided a systematic review establishing that proposed solutions uniformly failed what they termed the "zero semantic commitment condition"---the requirement that genuine solutions not presuppose the semantic capacities they purport to explain. Their analysis revealed that debates about grounding solutions often proceed without examining whether the problem itself is well-posed. More recently, Gubelmann (2024) has argued explicitly that the symbol grounding problem arises only when one presupposes questionable theories of meaning, particularly the computational theory of mind and denotational semantics. Under pragmatist alternatives where meaning is constituted by normative patterns of use, the grounding problem purportedly dissolves.

The emergence of large language models has reinvigorated these debates with new urgency. Contemporary philosophers remain sharply divided: some maintain that LLMs simply lack grounding and therefore genuine understanding, while others argue that sensory grounding was never necessary for semantic competence, or that LLMs circumvent rather than solve or fail the grounding challenge. These divergent verdicts trace, we shall argue, to divergent prior commitments about what meaning requires.

This review proceeds as follows. Section 1 examines the symbol grounding problem's formulation and traces its philosophical roots in debates about intentionality. Section 2 applies meta-semantic frameworks from philosophy of language---referentialism, inferentialism, use theories, and contemporary meta-semantics---to evaluate whether the problem presupposes contested theoretical commitments. Section 3 articulates specific research gaps and examines how LLM debates have reshaped the grounding question. The conclusion synthesizes findings and positions the contribution of exposing the symbol grounding problem's meta-semantic presuppositions.

## The Symbol Grounding Problem and Its Implicit Commitments

The symbol grounding problem occupies a peculiar position in contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Formulated as a challenge for computational systems, it has generated extensive debate about proposed solutions while receiving comparatively little scrutiny of its underlying assumptions. This section examines both the problem's formulation and the meta-semantic commitments embedded within it, tracing how the SGP inherits particular views about meaning from the intentionality debates that gave rise to it.

### The SGP's Formulation and Proposed Solutions

Harnad's (1990) canonical formulation presents the symbol grounding problem as arising from an inherent limitation of purely symbolic systems: symbols can only be defined in terms of other symbols, creating an infinite regress analogous to looking up words in a Chinese-Chinese dictionary while knowing no Chinese. The proposed solution involves hybrid systems where elementary symbols are grounded through "categorical perception"---the capacity to discriminate and identify sensorimotor patterns that bottom out in non-symbolic iconic representations. On this view, computational symbols acquire intrinsic meaning only when connected to perceptual experience through learned category boundaries.

This formulation shaped subsequent research in distinctive ways. Taddeo and Floridi (2005), in their influential systematic review, introduced the "zero semantic commitment condition" as a criterion for genuine solutions: any adequate approach must not presuppose the very semantic capacities it purports to explain. Evaluating eight proposed strategies against this criterion, they concluded that all fail---either smuggling in semantic assumptions through designer intentions, relying on causal correlations insufficient for meaning, or presupposing rather than explaining interpretive capacities. Their own "praxical" solution (Taddeo and Floridi 2007) shifted focus from perception to action, proposing that meaning emerges from successful goal-directed behavior in informationally rich environments.

Alternative approaches proliferated. Vogt (2002) developed the "physical" symbol grounding problem for embodied robotics, emphasizing how autonomous agents might develop grounded symbols through sensorimotor contingencies and situated interaction. Steels (2008) claimed the problem solved through language game experiments demonstrating that autonomous agents can develop shared symbol systems via social coordination. His optimism stands in sharp contrast to Bringsjord (2015), who argues that all proposed solutions fail to provide genuine grounding, relying instead on external interpretation or covertly presupposing the semantic capacities they aim to explain.

What unites these debates, despite their disagreements, is a shared assumption: that meaning requires some form of connection to non-symbolic reality, whether through perception, action, or social coordination. Yet this grounding thesis is rarely defended; it functions as a background premise structuring the solution space. Muller (2015) observes that there is no single, well-defined symbol grounding problem but rather multiple distinct questions conflated under one label. His suggestion that we focus on replicating the "behavioral ability and function of meaning" rather than solving a metaphysical puzzle about intrinsic content reflects skepticism about whether the problem is coherently formulated. This meta-critical perspective opens space for questioning whether the SGP's presuppositions are themselves defensible.

### Philosophical Roots in Intentionality Debates

The symbol grounding problem did not emerge in a philosophical vacuum. It inherits central assumptions from Searle's (1980) Chinese Room Argument, which established that syntactic symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine semantic understanding. Searle's thought experiment---in which a person manipulates Chinese symbols according to rules without understanding Chinese---aims to show that computational processes are merely formal, deriving whatever meaning they appear to have from external interpreters. Harnad (1989, 1994) explicitly develops the SGP as a constructive response to Searle's negative argument: while pure computation cannot ground meaning, hybrid systems might succeed where symbolic AI fails.

This inheritance shapes the problem's structure. Both Searle and Harnad presuppose a sharp distinction between syntax and semantics, treating the former as insufficient for the latter. This dichotomy appears natural within representationalist frameworks but is contested by alternative traditions in philosophy of language. More significantly, both assume that symbols require grounding in something external to symbolic manipulation itself---whether biological processes (Searle 1992) or sensorimotor experience (Harnad 1990).

Competing accounts of intentionality suggest different grounding requirements. Fodor's (1987) psychosemantics attempts to naturalize mental content through asymmetric causal dependency relations, suggesting that computational symbols could have non-derived content if properly causally connected to worldly properties. Dretske (1995) similarly grounds representation in information-theoretic relations developed through learning. These causal-informational theories offer externalist paths to naturalizing content that might dissolve the SGP by showing how symbols acquire meaning through environmental embedding rather than requiring phenomenal experience.

Teleosemantic approaches present another alternative. Millikan (1984) argues that mental content derives from proper functions shaped by natural selection: representations mean what their ancestors were selected to indicate. On this view, computational symbols manipulated in isolation lack content because they lack evolutionary history. However, one might argue that linguistic symbols acquire derived proper functions through cultural evolution---a possibility that transforms rather than dissolves the grounding question.

Most challenging for the SGP is the phenomenal intentionality tradition. Mendelovici (2018) and Loar (2003) argue that phenomenal consciousness is the basis of all intentionality---mental states have their content in virtue of what it is like to be in them. If this is correct, purely computational symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine meaning because it lacks phenomenology. This position supports Searle-style conclusions but raises a tension within the SGP framework: the problem assumes grounding is possible for computational systems while adopting premises that suggest otherwise.

Burge's (1979) social externalism offers yet another perspective. If mental content is partly constituted by social-linguistic practices external to individual cognition, then the SGP's focus on individual cognitive systems may be misdirected. Symbols might be grounded not in individual minds but in communal practices---a view with affinities to later proposals about social grounding (Steels 2008) but distinct in its emphasis on the constitutive role of linguistic community.

This diversity of intentionality theories reveals that the SGP embeds substantive commitments about what meaning requires. The problem appears most pressing under internalist, representationalist assumptions and may dissolve or transform under externalist, functionalist, or phenomenological alternatives. These implicit commitments have not been systematically examined in the grounding literature, leaving participants arguing past each other when their disagreements stem from divergent background theories of content.

## Meta-Semantic Frameworks and the Grounding Question

The symbol grounding problem does not arise in a theoretical vacuum. Its very formulation presupposes particular views about what meaning is and what makes semantic facts obtain. This section applies the apparatus of philosophy of language to evaluate whether the SGP tacitly assumes a narrow meta-semantic framework and whether alternative theories of meaning would generate different diagnostic verdicts. The central thesis is that the grounding problem appears most pressing under referentialist semantics, where meaning fundamentally involves word-world relations, but may dissolve or transform under inferentialist or use-theoretic alternatives that locate meaning in intralinguistic relations or practical competence.

### Referentialism and the Naturalness of Grounding

Direct reference theory, as developed through the Kripke-Donnellan revolution, holds that proper names and natural kind terms refer directly to objects via causal-historical chains rather than through associated descriptive content (Kripke 1980; Donnellan 1966). On this view, the name "Aristotle" refers to a particular individual not because speakers associate it with descriptions like "the teacher of Alexander," but because current uses are causally connected to an initial dubbing of that individual. Reference is established through chains of linguistic transmission tracing back to perceptual encounters with referents.

This framework makes symbol grounding appear both natural and necessary. If meaning fundamentally involves causal connections between symbols and the entities they denote, then computational symbols face an obvious challenge: they lack the requisite causal history linking them to worldly referents. Harnad's original formulation implicitly assumes something like this picture when requiring that symbols connect to "non-symbolic" sensorimotor representations (Harnad 1990). The grounding problem becomes urgent precisely because symbols in purely computational systems are causally isolated from the objects they purportedly represent.

Contemporary defenders of causal-historical semantics have explicitly connected this framework to the grounding debate. Devitt (2020) argues that reference is determined by causal-historical networks connecting terms to objects, providing a naturalistic metasemantic foundation. If this account is correct, then the SGP correctly identifies a genuine semantic requirement: symbols must be causally grounded to have determinate reference. Bielecka (2015) makes this connection explicit, arguing that proposed solutions to the SGP fail by their own standards because they cannot establish the causal connections that reference requires.

However, referentialist semantics faces its own well-known challenges that complicate its role in grounding debates. Distinguishing semantically appropriate causal chains from deviant ones remains difficult, and the framework struggles with abstract objects lacking causal profiles (Burgess and Sherman 2014). If reference to mathematical entities or fictional characters cannot proceed through causal chains, then causal grounding may not capture the full scope of semantic competence. These limitations suggest the SGP may inherit unresolved problems from the referentialist framework it presupposes.

### Inferentialism and Meaning Without Denotation

Brandomian inferentialism offers a radically different picture of semantic constitution. On this view, conceptual content is not fundamentally about word-world relations but is constituted by inferential roles in practices of giving and asking for reasons (Brandom 1994). Meaning is position in the "space of reasons"—the patterns of commitment and entitlement that govern how expressions can be used in reasoning. To understand a concept is to master its inferential articulation: knowing what follows from applying it, what warrants its application, and what it is incompatible with.

This framework has profound implications for the grounding problem. If meaning is inferential role rather than denotation, then symbols become meaningful through their position in networks of inference rather than through connections to non-symbolic reality. The SGP's demand that symbols be "grounded" in sensorimotor representations appears misguided—it asks for the wrong kind of semantic foundation. As Peregrin (2014) clarifies, inferentialism treats meaning as constituted by inferential rules governing expression use, making reference derivative rather than constitutive of content.

A natural objection is that inferentialism cannot accommodate the intuition underlying the SGP—that language must somehow connect to the world. Brandom (2010) directly addresses this concern, arguing that inferentialist semantics is compatible with world-directedness without reducing meaning to reference. Observational concepts gain their content through their role in perceptual judgments, but this role is itself inferentially articulated. The world shapes our inferential practices through perception and action, but the semantic content of concepts remains their inferential significance. Grounding becomes a matter of how inferential practices are causally sustained, not a requirement that symbols directly connect to referents.

Contemporary work has begun applying inferentialist frameworks to artificial systems. Arai and Tsugawa (2024) argue that Brandomian semantics provides a better foundation for understanding large language models than referentialist alternatives. LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties, processing language through inference and substitution patterns without requiring reference to external world representations. If inferentialism captures how LLMs achieve semantic competence, this suggests the SGP presupposes a referentialist picture that may not apply to all meaning-bearing systems. Carter, Collin, and Palermos (2016) note that inferentialism entails a form of active externalism where meaning is constituted by extended inferential practices, suggesting that grounding might be about embedding in practices rather than individual symbol-object links.

### Use Theories and the Wittgensteinian Alternative

Use-theoretic accounts of meaning, tracing to Wittgenstein's later philosophy, propose that meaning is constituted by rule-governed participation in language games rather than by reference to objects or mental representations (Griffin 2020; Kamota and Ndemo 2024). To understand a word is to know how to use it—to have mastered the practices governing its employment in linguistic and practical activities. Meaning is thus not a relation between symbol and referent but a capacity for appropriate use within a form of life.

This framework generates a distinctive diagnosis of the grounding problem. Gubelmann (2024) argues explicitly that the SGP arises only if one adopts the computational theory of mind or referentialist semantics. Under pragmatic, use-based theories, the problem dissolves: symbols become meaningful through participation in normative linguistic practices, not through perceptual anchoring or reference to external objects. If LLMs participate in language games governed by pragmatic norms—responding appropriately, following conversational conventions, producing contextually fitting outputs—they may satisfy the conditions for meaning that use theories specify.

However, Wittgensteinian approaches also reveal demanding requirements that computational systems may fail to meet. Bottazzi and Ferrario (2025) develop a sophisticated critique based on "constancy"—the capacity to maintain reference points through agreement in definitions and judgments across dialogue turns. Genuine communication requires tracking commitments and detecting contradictions throughout extended exchanges, capacities they argue LLMs lack. The appearance of understanding arises from what they call "bewitchment": humans follow familiar language games while assuming understanding until proven otherwise. This analysis suggests use theories may set higher bars than simple pattern-matching—they demand normatively governed consistency in practice, not merely locally fluent outputs.

The tension between these Wittgensteinian positions reveals important ambiguities in what "use" means. If appropriate use requires only producing contextually suitable responses, LLMs may qualify. If it requires maintaining stable commitments across extended interactions, tracking logical relations, and participating in forms of life involving more than linguistic behavior, the requirements become more demanding. The SGP may not simply dissolve under use theories but transform into questions about what aspects of use are constitutive of meaning.

### Contemporary Meta-Semantics and Grounding

Recent meta-semantic theory provides refined tools for analyzing the SGP's presuppositions. Meta-semantics asks what makes semantic facts obtain—a question distinct from what semantic facts there are (Burgess and Sherman 2014). This distinction reveals that the SGP operates at the meta-semantic level, asking what grounds symbol meaning, but rarely makes its meta-semantic commitments explicit.

Cohnitz and Haukioja (2025) defend "meta-internalism": the view that foundations of reference are anchored in individual psychological states and dispositions. This might seem to support the SGP's concern with how individual systems ground their symbols. However, they argue meta-internalism is compatible with semantic externalism as usually understood, complicating simple narratives about what grounding requires. The meta-semantic story about why symbols mean what they do may involve factors quite different from what determines their semantic content.

Alternative meta-semantic frameworks suggest different pictures of what the SGP asks. Keiser (2022) proposes that language's essential function is directing attention for achieving social goals rather than transmitting information. If meaning is fundamentally about coordinating attention and action, grounding might concern social embedding rather than perceptual connection to referents. Simchen (2017) develops a Fregean approach centered on "aboutness" rather than reference, where semantic values reflect cognitive significance rather than referential relations. This suggests grounding might concern what symbols are about—their cognitive role—rather than what they denote.

The question of semantic scrutability bears directly on whether the grounding problem can be answered. Cappelen (2020) argues that semantic facts are fundamentally inscrutable: the mechanisms determining meaning are too complex and unstable to grasp. If correct, this suggests the SGP may target an impossible explanatory goal—we cannot make semantic grounding fully transparent even for human language. Pollock (2020) responds that internalist conceptual role theories can meet scrutability requirements, defending the view that internal states provide tractable grounding. This debate reveals that positions on symbol grounding often reflect deeper commitments about whether semantic determination is epistemically accessible.

Taken together, contemporary meta-semantics reveals that the grounding question cannot be answered without first specifying which theory of meaning determination is presupposed. Sogaard (2025) argues that debates about whether LLMs have semantics reflect deeper disagreements about what semantics is rather than merely empirical questions about capabilities. Correspondence theories require reference to world states, coherence theories require internal consistency, and inferentialist theories require patterns of inferential role—each generating different grounding criteria. The SGP's formulation may presuppose correspondence-based semantics, making its grounding requirements appear universal when they are in fact theory-dependent.

This meta-semantic analysis supports the hypothesis that the symbol grounding problem is not a theory-neutral puzzle but a reflection of particular commitments about meaning constitution. Under referentialist frameworks, grounding is central and challenging. Under inferentialist alternatives, it may become peripheral or dissolve into questions about inferential competence. Under use theories, it transforms into questions about practical embedding in normative linguistic practices. The problem's persistence in AI debates may partly reflect the field's unreflective inheritance of referentialist assumptions from the computational theory of mind, rather than identifying a semantic constraint that all theories of meaning would recognize.

## Research Gaps and Contemporary Reconsideration

The preceding analysis reveals that philosophical engagement with the symbol grounding problem has been uneven: extensive within cognitive science and AI, but surprisingly limited within philosophy of language proper. Four significant gaps emerge from this literature, each reflecting the unexamined theoretical assumptions that have shaped the debate.

### Gap 1: Systematic Analysis of the SGP's Meta-Semantic Presuppositions

Despite decades of discussion, remarkably few papers systematically examine which theory of meaning the symbol grounding problem presupposes. Muller (2015) argues there is no single, well-defined SGP but rather multiple distinct questions that become conflated depending on one's theoretical commitments about computation and semantics. His diagnosis suggests that participants in grounding debates often talk past each other because they implicitly adopt incompatible frameworks. More recently, Gubelmann (2024) contends that the SGP only arises when one accepts the computational theory of mind combined with referentialist semantics; under pragmatist alternatives, the problem dissolves rather than demands solution.

Yet systematic meta-semantic analysis remains rare. Sogaard (2025) demonstrates that verdicts about whether LLMs possess semantics depend heavily on which semantic theory one adopts---correspondence, coherence, inferentialist, or deflationary---suggesting that grounding debates reflect deeper disagreements about what semantics is rather than purely empirical questions about system capabilities. This theoretical pluralism has not been adequately mapped onto the SGP literature. Bielecka (2015), while critiquing proposed solutions, does not examine whether the problem's formulation itself embeds contestable assumptions. The gap is significant: without clarity about which semantic framework makes the SGP cogent, researchers cannot determine whether they face a genuine explanatory challenge or a theory-laden pseudo-problem.

### Gap 2: Inferentialist and Use-Theoretic Responses to the SGP

Philosophy of language offers sophisticated alternatives to referentialist semantics, yet these frameworks remain underdeployed in grounding debates. Brandom's (1994, 2010) normative inferentialism holds that conceptual content is constituted by inferential role in practices of giving and asking for reasons. On this view, symbols acquire meaning through their position in inferential networks, not through connections to non-symbolic reality. Peregrin (2014) clarifies that if meaning is inferential rules rather than world-reference, the grounding problem transforms into a question about acquiring appropriate inferential competencies---a different kind of challenge than Harnad's formulation suggests.

Direct application of inferentialism to the SGP is strikingly rare. Arai and Tsugawa (2024) represent a recent exception, arguing that Brandomian inferential semantics provides a better foundation for understanding LLMs than traditional distributional or representational semantics. They contend that LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties: processing language through inference, substitution, and anaphora patterns without requiring reference to external world representations. This suggests the SGP's focus on denotation may be misplaced. Similarly, Wittgensteinian use theories, defended by Kamota and Ndemo (2024) and applied to AI by Griffin (2020), imply that symbols become meaningful through rule-governed participation in language games rather than perceptual anchoring. Bottazzi and Ferrario (2025) develop this perspective, emphasizing that genuine linguistic competence requires "constancy" in maintaining reference points through agreement in both definitions and judgments---a pragmatic criterion that differs markedly from sensorimotor grounding requirements.

The gap here is not merely scholarly but consequential. If inferentialist or use-theoretic frameworks dissolve the SGP, then decades of research seeking solutions may have pursued a misformulated problem. Conversely, if these frameworks merely relocate rather than dissolve grounding requirements, this would vindicate the problem's significance while transforming its content.

### Gap 3: Disambiguation of "Grounding" Across Dimensions

The SGP literature often treats grounding as a unitary phenomenon: symbols either are or are not grounded. Contemporary work reveals this binary framing as misleading. Lyre (2024) proposes a three-dimensional framework distinguishing functional grounding (behavioral success in tasks), social grounding (normative correctness in linguistic practices), and causal grounding (development of world models through environmental interaction). On this analysis, LLMs exhibit grounding along all three dimensions to varying degrees, making simple yes-or-no verdicts inadequate.

Quigley and Maynard (2025) develop this insight further, identifying six grounding dimensions indexed by evaluation context, meaning type, and reference distribution: authenticity, preservation, correlational faithfulness, etiological faithfulness, robustness, and compositionality. Their framework reveals that LLMs show strong correlational faithfulness for linguistic tasks but lack etiological warrant for world-directed tasks without grounded interaction. This multidimensional analysis suggests that the original SGP conflates distinct requirements that may be satisfied independently.

Dove (2024) reinforces this point from a different angle, arguing that human cognition itself combines embodied grounding with linguistic "ungrounded cognition"---genuine cognitive content not requiring direct sensorimotor grounding. LLMs reveal language as a source of semantic information that can scaffold and extend cognitive capacities without full perceptual anchoring. The gap revealed here is not merely taxonomic: without disambiguating grounding dimensions, participants cannot determine which grounding requirements are necessary for which semantic capacities, leaving the debate irresolvable at the level of generality at which it has typically been conducted.

### Gap 4: The SGP's Applicability to Large Language Models

Perhaps the most contested contemporary question is whether the SGP applies to LLMs at all, and if so, what verdict it delivers. Sharp disagreement persists. Harnad (2023), the problem's original formulator, maintains that while LLMs perform surprisingly well due to "benign biases" inherent in language at scale, they lack direct sensorimotor grounding connecting words to referents. Their success reflects the nature of language itself---its redundancy, context-sensitivity, compositional structure---rather than genuine understanding.

Against this, Chalmers (2024) argues that "pure thinkers" capable of thought without sensation are possible in principle, challenging the assumption that sensorimotor grounding is constitutive of meaning rather than merely facilitating it. If Chalmers is correct, Harnad's formulation presupposes an unnecessarily strong empiricist thesis. Floridi, Jia, and Tohme (2025) stake out a middle position using category theory: LLMs neither solve nor fail the SGP but rather circumvent it through a fundamentally different semantic architecture. Their formal analysis suggests LLMs operate in a parallel semantic space, generating contextually appropriate outputs without the grounding that characterizes human meaning-making. Milliere and Buckner (2024) provide comprehensive review showing that many classical objections to neural networks---lack of compositionality, inability to learn language structure, absence of systematic semantic competence---no longer clearly apply to modern LLMs, forcing reconsideration of what grounding requires.

This disagreement is illuminating precisely because different theoretical commitments yield different verdicts. Those maintaining referentialist assumptions find LLMs ungrounded; those adopting inferentialist or pragmatist frameworks find the grounding question transformed or dissolved. LLMs thus serve as crucial test cases revealing which meta-semantic assumptions drive the debate.

## Conclusion

This review has argued that the symbol grounding problem, as traditionally formulated, presupposes specific meta-semantic commitments that philosophers of language have contested. Three central findings emerge from the analysis.

First, the SGP's demand that symbols be "grounded" in non-symbolic reality reflects referentialist or denotational assumptions about meaning---assumptions that inferentialist, use-theoretic, and pragmatist frameworks reject or substantially modify. The problem appears most pressing when one presupposes that meaning fundamentally consists in word-world reference relations and that symbols lacking such relations cannot possess intrinsic semantic content. Under alternative frameworks where meaning is constituted by inferential role, participation in language games, or normative patterns of use, the grounding requirement transforms or dissolves. The SGP is not theory-neutral but theory-laden.

Second, philosophers of language have not systematically engaged with the SGP despite possessing relevant theoretical resources. Brandom's inferentialism, Wittgensteinian use theories, and contemporary meta-semantics all bear directly on whether grounding is a genuine semantic requirement, yet explicit connections remain underdeveloped. This disciplinary gap has allowed the SGP to be treated as a technical problem in cognitive science rather than a philosophical puzzle requiring meta-semantic analysis.

Third, contemporary LLM debates have inadvertently revealed the SGP's theoretical assumptions by generating radically different verdicts depending on one's semantic framework. Participants who deny LLMs possess understanding typically presuppose referentialist grounding requirements; those who attribute understanding often adopt inferentialist or use-theoretic alternatives. The disagreement is not purely empirical but reflects deeper commitments about what meaning requires.

The research contribution emerging from this analysis is both diagnostic and constructive. Diagnostically, it demonstrates that the symbol grounding problem's cogency depends on prior meta-semantic commitments that deserve explicit examination rather than tacit assumption. Constructively, it identifies four gaps where philosophical work is needed: systematic analysis of the SGP's presuppositions, development of inferentialist and use-theoretic responses, disambiguation of grounding dimensions, and careful assessment of whether and how the problem applies to modern AI systems. Addressing these gaps would transform the grounding debate from an unresolved technical challenge into a substantive philosophical inquiry about the nature of meaning and the conditions under which computational systems can possess it.
