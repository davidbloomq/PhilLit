# Literature Review Outline

**Research Project**: The Symbol Grounding Problem in Philosophy of Language: Meta-Semantic Presuppositions and Philosophical Engagement
**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Total Literature Base**: 107 papers across 6 domains

---

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the symbol grounding problem as a philosophical puzzle requiring meta-semantic analysis, not merely a technical challenge for AI.

**Content**:
- The SGP (Harnad 1990) asks how computational symbols acquire intrinsic semantic content rather than meaning parasitic on external interpreters
- The problem emerged from engagement with Searle's Chinese Room (Searle 1980), sharing the assumption that syntax cannot constitute semantics
- Central questions for this review: (1) Do philosophers of language engage the SGP or find its framing problematic? (2) Does the SGP presuppose a narrow meta-semantic view (denotational/referential semantics)? (3) Where has philosophical discussion of the SGP gone?
- The LLM revolution has reinvigorated these debates, with philosophers split on whether modern systems solve, circumvent, or remain untouched by the grounding problem
- Structure preview: From SGP formulation through meta-semantic analysis to contemporary reconsideration

**Key Papers**:
- Harnad 1990 (foundational SGP formulation)
- Searle 1980 (Chinese Room as precursor)
- Taddeo & Floridi 2005 (systematic review establishing "zero semantic commitment" condition)
- Gubelmann 2024 (recent argument that SGP presupposes questionable semantic theories)

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: The Symbol Grounding Problem and Its Implicit Commitments

**Section Purpose**: Establish what the SGP claims, trace its origins in philosophy of mind, and identify the meta-semantic commitments embedded in its formulation.

**Main Claims**:
1. The SGP presupposes that meaning requires connection to non-symbolic reality (grounding thesis)
2. This presupposition reflects specific meta-semantic commitments that philosophers of language have contested
3. The problem's framing as requiring "intrinsic" rather than "parasitic" meaning embeds assumptions about what semantics requires

### Subsection 1.1: The SGP's Formulation and Proposed Solutions

**Papers**: Harnad 1990, Harnad 1994, Taddeo & Floridi 2005, Taddeo & Floridi 2007, Vogt 2002, Steels 2008, Bringsjord 2015
**Content**:
- Harnad's original proposal: hybrid systems with sensorimotor grounding through categorical perception
- The "zero semantic commitment" condition (Taddeo & Floridi 2005) and why proposed solutions allegedly fail it
- Alternative approaches: action-based semantics (Taddeo & Floridi 2007), social grounding (Steels 2008), embodied robotics (Vogt 2002)
- The skeptical position: Bringsjord and others argue the SGP remains unsolved
- Key question: What assumptions about meaning are embedded in these debates?

**Gap Connection**: The debates about solutions rarely question whether the problem itself is well-posed given alternative semantic theories

### Subsection 1.2: Philosophical Roots in Intentionality Debates

**Papers**: Searle 1980, Searle 1992, Fodor 1987, Dretske 1995, Millikan 1984, Burge 1979
**Content**:
- The SGP inherits Searle's claim that syntax cannot constitute semantics
- Competing accounts of intentionality: causal-informational (Fodor, Dretske), teleosemantic (Millikan), externalist (Burge)
- How each account implies different grounding requirements or dissolves them
- Phenomenal intentionality (Mendelovici 2018, Loar 2003): if consciousness grounds intentionality, computational symbols cannot have original meaning
- Tension: The SGP assumes grounding is possible for AI while adopting premises (from Searle) suggesting it is not

**Gap Connection**: Philosophy of mind debates about intentionality have not been systematically connected to meta-semantic analysis of the SGP's presuppositions

**Section Summary**: The SGP rests on assumptions about meaning shared with certain intentionality theories but contested by others. The problem space is shaped by these prior commitments.
**Word Target**: 800-900 words

## Section 2: Meta-Semantic Frameworks and the Grounding Question

**Section Purpose**: Apply philosophy of language apparatus to evaluate whether the SGP presupposes a particular (and contested) meta-semantic view.

**Main Claims**:
1. The SGP most naturally aligns with referentialist/denotational semantics where meaning is fundamentally about word-world relations
2. Alternative meta-semantic frameworks (inferentialism, use theories, conceptual role semantics) suggest grounding requirements differ or dissolve
3. Recent meta-semantics distinguishes what determines meaning from what meaning is, revealing hidden assumptions in SGP formulations

### Subsection 2.1: Referentialism and the Naturalness of Grounding

**Papers**: Kripke 1980, Donnellan 1966, Devitt 2020, Bielecka 2015 (causal reference)
**Content**:
- Direct reference theory: names refer via causal-historical chains, not descriptive content
- Causal theories make symbol grounding a natural requirement: symbols must causally connect to referents
- Bielecka 2015 explicitly connects SGP to causal-historical reference
- If referentialism is correct, the SGP identifies a genuine constraint on symbol meaning
- Problem: causal theories face their own challenges (distinguishing appropriate causal chains, handling abstract objects)

**Gap Connection**: Few SGP papers explicitly defend the referentialist assumptions their arguments depend on

### Subsection 2.2: Inferentialism and Meaning Without Denotation

**Papers**: Brandom 1994, Brandom 2010, Peregrin 2014, Williamson 2008, Hlobil 2022, Carter et al. 2016
**Content**:
- Brandomian inferentialism: meaning is constituted by inferential role in practices of giving and asking for reasons
- On this view, symbols can be meaningful through their place in inferential networks without requiring grounding in non-symbolic reality
- Brandom 2010 addresses how inferentialism accommodates world-directedness without reducing meaning to reference
- Teleo-inferentialism (Hlobil 2022) attempts to naturalize inferential norms through biological function
- Key insight: If meaning IS inferential role, the SGP asks the wrong question

**Gap Connection**: Inferentialist responses to the SGP remain underdeveloped despite the framework's relevance

### Subsection 2.3: Use Theories and the Wittgensteinian Alternative

**Papers**: Griffin 2020, Kamota & Ndemo 2024, Gubelmann 2024, Bottazzi & Ferrario 2025
**Content**:
- Wittgensteinian meaning-as-use: meaning is constituted by rule-governed participation in language games
- Gubelmann 2024 argues the SGP presupposes the computational theory of mind and dissolves under pragmatist semantics
- Bottazzi & Ferrario 2025 apply Wittgensteinian analysis to LLMs, emphasizing "constancy" in reference-tracking
- Use theories suggest grounding is achieved through appropriate linguistic practice, not perceptual anchoring
- Tension: use theories may require social embedding that computational systems lack

**Gap Connection**: Systematic Wittgensteinian analysis of the SGP's presuppositions remains a significant gap

### Subsection 2.4: Contemporary Meta-Semantics and Grounding

**Papers**: Burgess & Sherman 2014, Cohnitz & Haukioja 2025, Keiser 2022, Simchen 2017, Cappelen 2020, Pollock 2020
**Content**:
- Meta-semantics asks what makes semantic facts obtain, distinct from what semantic facts there are
- The SGP operates at the meta-semantic level but rarely makes its meta-semantic commitments explicit
- Non-ideal foundations (Keiser 2022): meaning may be about attention-direction for social goals, not information transmission
- Inscrutability (Cappelen 2020): if semantic determination is fundamentally inscrutable, the SGP may be unanswerable
- Internalist meta-semantics (Pollock 2020): conceptual role might provide scrutable grounding

**Gap Connection**: The SGP literature has not systematically engaged with contemporary meta-semantics

**Section Summary**: Different meta-semantic frameworks yield different verdicts on the SGP. The problem appears most pressing under referentialism and may dissolve or transform under inferentialist or use-theoretic alternatives. This supports the hypothesis that the SGP presupposes a narrow meta-semantic view.
**Word Target**: 1000-1200 words

## Section 3: Research Gaps and Contemporary Reconsideration

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what is missing in the literature and how LLM debates have reshaped the grounding question

**Gap 1: Systematic Philosophical Analysis of SGP's Meta-Semantic Presuppositions**
- **Evidence**: Muller 2015 argues there is no single SGP but multiple versions depending on theoretical commitments; Gubelmann 2024 argues it presupposes CTM and referentialism; few papers systematically examine which semantic theory is presupposed
- **Why it matters**: Without clarity on meta-semantic assumptions, participants talk past each other
- **How research addresses it**: This review demonstrates that the SGP's cogency depends on prior semantic commitments
- **Supporting literature**: Muller 2015, Gubelmann 2024, Sogaard 2025, Bielecka 2015

**Gap 2: Inferentialist and Use-Theoretic Responses to the SGP**
- **Evidence**: Despite extensive inferentialist literature (Brandom 1994, 2010; Peregrin 2014), direct application to the SGP is rare; Arai & Tsugawa 2024 is a recent exception connecting inferentialism to LLMs
- **Why it matters**: Inferentialism offers a principled alternative where meaning does not require denotational grounding
- **How research addresses it**: Identifying this gap invites philosophical work connecting philosophy of language to AI semantics
- **Supporting literature**: Brandom 1994, Arai & Tsugawa 2024, Peregrin 2014

**Gap 3: Disambiguation of "Grounding" Across Dimensions**
- **Evidence**: Lyre 2024 proposes functional, social, and causal grounding dimensions; Quigley & Maynard 2025 identify six grounding dimensions; but the SGP literature often treats grounding as unitary
- **Why it matters**: LLMs may be grounded along some dimensions but not others, making binary verdicts misleading
- **How research addresses it**: Multidimensional frameworks reveal the SGP conflates distinct requirements
- **Supporting literature**: Lyre 2024, Quigley & Maynard 2025, Dove 2024

**Gap 4: The SGP's Applicability to LLMs**
- **Evidence**: Sharp disagreement: Harnad 2023 maintains LLMs lack grounding; Chalmers 2024 argues sensory grounding is unnecessary for thought; Floridi et al. 2025 argue LLMs circumvent the SGP
- **Why it matters**: LLMs serve as crucial test cases for grounding theories
- **How research addresses it**: Contemporary debate reveals which theoretical assumptions drive different verdicts
- **Supporting literature**: Harnad 2023, Chalmers 2024, Floridi et al. 2025, Milliere & Buckner 2024

**Synthesis**: These gaps collectively reveal that the SGP has been treated as a technical problem in cognitive science without adequate attention to its philosophical foundations. Philosophers of language have relevant resources (inferentialism, use theories, contemporary meta-semantics) that remain underdeployed. The LLM resurgence provides both urgency and new test cases for addressing these gaps.

**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

- Contemporary LLM debates have reinvigorated these questions, with participants implicitly adopting different semantic theories leading to different verdicts
- The research contribution: exposing the SGP's meta-semantic presuppositions and identifying how alternative frameworks transform the debate
- Future directions: systematic inferentialist/use-theoretic responses to the SGP; disambiguation of grounding dimensions; empirical work connecting LLM capabilities to specific semantic theories

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

**Tone**: Analytical, focused on the central hypothesis that the SGP presupposes a narrow meta-semantic view. Build the case systematically through:
1. Showing what the SGP assumes (Section 1)
2. Demonstrating these assumptions are contested (Section 2)
3. Identifying gaps that result from this theoretical mismatch (Section 3)

**Key Arguments to Develop**:
1. The SGP inherits assumptions from Searle's Chinese Room that many philosophers of language reject
2. Referentialist semantics makes grounding central; inferentialist and use-theoretic alternatives make it peripheral or dissolved
3. Contemporary meta-semantics provides tools for disambiguating what the SGP is really asking
4. LLM debates reveal how different semantic theories lead to different verdicts, supporting the claim that the SGP is theory-laden rather than theory-neutral

**Potential Objections to Address**:
- Objection: Even inferentialists need symbols to connect to the world somehow. Response: Brandom 2010 shows how inferentialism accommodates world-directedness without making grounding foundational
- Objection: Use theories just relocate grounding to social practices. Response: This may dissolve rather than solve the SGP by making individual symbol-world connections derivative rather than constitutive
- Objection: LLMs are not relevant to the philosophical question. Response: They serve as existence proofs or counterexamples for various grounding claims
