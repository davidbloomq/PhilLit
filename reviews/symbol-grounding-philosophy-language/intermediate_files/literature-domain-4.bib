====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the fundamental problem of how mental states have
content and are "about" things in the world. The field divides into
several major theoretical camps: (1) Causal theories (Dretske, Fodor)
explain mental content through informational/causal relations between
mental states and worldly states of affairs. (2) Teleosemantic theories
(Millikan) ground content in biological functions shaped by natural
selection. (3) Conceptual role semantics emphasizes inferential
connections among mental states. (4) Phenomenal intentionality theories
(Loar, Kriegel, Mendelovici) argue that consciousness itself grounds
intentionality. (5) Externalist theories (Burge, Putnam) hold that
mental content is partially constituted by environmental factors.

The Chinese Room argument (Searle 1980) presents a decisive challenge to
computational theories of mind, arguing that syntactic symbol manipulation
cannot generate genuine semantic understanding. This connects directly to
the symbol grounding problem: computational systems manipulate formal
symbols, but these symbols lack intrinsic meaning. Searle's argument has
motivated both defenses of biological bases for intentionality and
attempts to naturalize intentionality within computational frameworks.

Recent work has extended these debates to large language models,
questioning whether statistical patterns can constitute genuine
linguistic intentionality (Grindrod 2024). The field exhibits ongoing
tension between internalist approaches (content supervenes on intrinsic
states) and externalist approaches (content depends on environmental
relations).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The symbol grounding problem is fundamentally a problem about
intentionality: How do symbols come to be about things? Philosophical
theories of mental content provide crucial background for understanding
different meta-semantic assumptions that might underlie the SGP.
Externalist theories suggest the SGP may presuppose an overly narrow,
internalist conception of content. Phenomenal intentionality theories
offer alternatives to purely computational accounts. Understanding these
debates is essential for evaluating whether the SGP rests on contentious
meta-semantic assumptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While extensive work addresses the metaphysics of intentionality, less
attention has been paid to how different meta-semantic theories
specifically relate to the SGP formulation. The connection between
conceptual role semantics and symbol grounding remains under-explored.
Recent LLM work has just begun connecting to these traditional debates.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should map how different theories of mental content imply
different views on symbol grounding. Pay special attention to the
internalism/externalism divide and whether externalist meta-semantics
dissolves or reshapes the SGP. The Chinese Room provides a crucial
bridge between philosophy of mind and computational linguistics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle presents the Chinese Room thought experiment to argue that syntactic symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine semantic understanding. A person following rules to manipulate Chinese symbols could pass the Turing test without understanding Chinese, demonstrating that programs cannot produce intentionality. The argument targets "Strong AI" - the claim that appropriately programmed computers literally understand language.

  RELEVANCE: This is the canonical statement of the computational challenge to symbol grounding. Searle argues that formal symbols lack intrinsic intentionality - they are only meaningful relative to observers. This directly raises the meta-semantic question of what grounds meaning, suggesting biological processes rather than computation. The Chinese Room has structured decades of debate about whether computational systems can have genuine intentionality, making it essential for understanding philosophical engagement with the SGP.

  POSITION: Anti-computationalism about intentionality. Argues that syntactic operations cannot generate semantic content, supporting biological naturalism.

  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/5834.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle develops his biological naturalism, arguing that consciousness and intentionality are caused by neurobiological processes but cannot be reduced to or identified with computational states. He criticizes both dualism and computational functionalism, arguing that first-person ontology of consciousness is irreducible to third-person descriptions. Mental phenomena are higher-level features of brain processes, analogous to how liquidity is a feature of H2O molecules.

  RELEVANCE: Provides Searle's positive account of intentionality to complement the negative Chinese Room argument. His biological naturalism suggests that symbol grounding requires specific biological substrate, not just functional organization. This raises the question whether the SGP implicitly assumes substrate-independence (a computational assumption Searle rejects). The work clarifies what Searle thinks IS required for genuine intentionality beyond syntax.

  POSITION: Biological naturalism. Intentionality requires biological processes; computational states are observer-relative and lack intrinsic intentionality.

  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/5684.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Fodor defends a computational-representational theory of mind (CRTM) while attempting to naturalize mental content through asymmetric causal dependency. Mental representations get their content from reliable causal connections to worldly properties, where the connection to veridical instances asymmetrically depends on connections to non-veridical instances. This asymmetry distinguishes representation from mere correlation and addresses the disjunction problem for informational semantics.

  RELEVANCE: Presents a major attempt to provide naturalistic semantics compatible with computational theories of mind - directly relevant to whether computational symbol manipulation can ground meaning. Fodor's account suggests symbols CAN have non-derived content if properly causally connected to the world, offering an externalist meta-semantics that might challenge narrow formulations of the SGP. However, his reliance on asymmetric dependence has been widely criticized.

  POSITION: Causal-informational theory with computational implementation. Defends the possibility of naturalized computational semantics through external causal relations.

  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/4872.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dretske develops his representational theory of consciousness, arguing that phenomenal experience consists in the awareness of representational content, where representation is naturalized through informational relations. Mental states acquire content through indicator functions developed through learning, where C-fibers firing means "tissue damage" because they reliably carry information about damage. Consciousness is the process of becoming aware of information the mind already represents.

  RELEVANCE: Offers an influential naturalistic account of intentionality based on information theory, providing resources for grounding symbol meaning in causal-informational relations with the environment. Like Fodor but with different details, Dretske suggests externalist paths to naturalizing content that might dissolve the SGP if symbols are understood as embedded in information-carrying systems. His account addresses how representation can arise from non-representational physical processes.

  POSITION: Informational semantics. Mental content grounded in learned indicator functions that carry information about environmental states.

  year = {1984},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/4124.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Millikan develops teleosemantics, arguing that mental and linguistic content is grounded in proper functions shaped by natural selection. A representation's content is determined by what it was selected to indicate or bring about. Mental states have their content in virtue of evolutionary history - they mean what their ancestors were selected for representing. This provides a naturalistic, non-magical account of intentionality based on biological function rather than current causal relations.

  RELEVANCE: Teleosemantics offers a distinctive naturalistic alternative to causal-informational theories, with important implications for symbol grounding. Millikan's view suggests that isolated symbols manipulated in computation lack content because they lack proper functions - content requires historical-functional relations that artificial systems don't possess. However, one could argue that linguistic symbols acquire derived proper functions through cultural evolution. Her work raises the question whether the SGP presupposes anti-teleological meta-semantics.

  POSITION: Teleosemantics. Content grounded in evolutionary proper functions. Strong biological naturalism that challenges computational accounts.

  pages = {73--121},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1475-4975.1979.tb00374.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Through thought experiments involving arthritis and other concepts, Burge argues that mental content is not determined solely by internal physical states but depends on social-linguistic community. An individual who misunderstands "arthritis" (thinking it can occur in the thigh) has different mental states than a duplicate in a community where "arthritis" has broader meaning. This establishes anti-individualism: mental contents are individuated by social-environmental factors external to the subject.

  RELEVANCE: Burge's externalism has profound implications for the symbol grounding problem. If content is partly constituted by social-linguistic practices external to individual cognition, then the SGP's focus on individual cognitive systems may be misdirected. Symbols might be grounded not in individual minds but in communal practices. This suggests the SGP may presuppose individualism - a contentious meta-semantic assumption. Burge's work opens space for social externalist solutions to grounding.

  POSITION: Social externalism about mental content. Content depends on linguistic community, not just internal states.

@book{mendelovici2018phenomenal,

  year = {2018},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190863807.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mendelovici defends phenomenal intentionality theory (PIT), arguing that phenomenal consciousness is the basis of all intentionality. Mental states have their content in virtue of what it's like to be in them - there is something it's like to think about Paris, and this phenomenology constitutes the state's aboutness. She addresses challenges about unconscious intentionality by arguing we only derivatively represent such contents by self-ascription. This radically internalist view makes intentionality intrinsic to phenomenology.

  RELEVANCE: PIT offers a non-naturalistic alternative to causal and functional theories, with striking implications for symbol grounding. If intentionality requires phenomenal consciousness, then purely computational symbol manipulation cannot constitute genuine meaning - supporting Searle-style conclusions but from phenomenological rather than biological grounds. This raises the question whether the SGP presupposes that phenomenology is explanatorily idle (eliminativism about qualia), which PIT theorists reject. Mendelovici's internalism contrasts sharply with Burge's externalism.

  POSITION: Phenomenal intentionality theory. All intentionality derives from phenomenal consciousness; radical internalism about content.

  number = {2},
  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-024-04723-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grindrod argues that LLMs like GPT can have genuine linguistic intentionality despite lacking mental intentionality. Drawing on Evans's account of naming practices and Millikan's teleosemantics, he argues that linguistic content depends on integration into pre-existing linguistic systems and practices, not on speaker psychology. LLM outputs can be meaningful because they participate in established linguistic conventions, even though the models lack beliefs or phenomenology. This separates linguistic from mental intentionality.

  RELEVANCE: This recent paper directly connects classical philosophy of mind to contemporary AI, addressing whether statistical language models can have genuine intentional content. Grindrod suggests that focusing on mental intentionality misses how linguistic meaning works - language gets meaning from social practices, not individual minds. This externalist approach offers novel resources for addressing symbol grounding in LLMs, suggesting the SGP may have conflated linguistic and mental intentionality. The paper demonstrates how meta-semantic theory matters for evaluating AI systems.

  POSITION: Linguistic intentionality can be separated from mental intentionality. LLM outputs can be genuinely meaningful through participation in linguistic practices.

@article{loar2003phenomenal,
  author = {Loar, Brian},
  title = {Phenomenal intentionality as the basis of mental content},
  journal = {Reflections and Replies: Essays on the Philosophy of Tyler Burge},
  year = {2003},
  pages = {229--258},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Loar argues that phenomenal states have an intrinsic, non-derivative kind of intentionality that grounds all other intentionality. The phenomenology of thinking about water itself constitutes that thought's aboutness, not external relations to H2O. This phenomenal intentionality is conceptually and metaphysically prior to any naturalistic reduction - it's a primitive feature of conscious experience. Loar contrasts this with Burge's externalism, arguing that phenomenology individuates content more fundamentally than environmental factors.

  RELEVANCE: Loar's paper is foundational for phenomenal intentionality theory and directly challenges externalist meta-semantics like Burge's. For the SGP, this raises crucial questions about what kind of intentionality needs grounding. If phenomenal intentionality is primitive, then the search for naturalistic grounding conditions may be misguided - intentionality might be irreducible. However, this would suggest symbols lacking phenomenology cannot have intrinsic intentionality, supporting Searle's conclusions. Loar's view represents an important non-naturalist strand in the debate.

  POSITION: Phenomenal intentionality theory. Conscious phenomenology intrinsically and primitively possesses intentionality; internalist rejection of naturalism.

  title = {The phenomenal intentionality research program},
  journal = {Phenomenal Intentionality},
  year = {2013},
  pages = {1--26},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kriegel systematizes phenomenal intentionality theory as a research program, identifying core theses: (1) some mental states have phenomenal intentionality, (2) phenomenal intentionality is the most fundamental kind, (3) other forms of intentionality derive from it. He distinguishes stronger and weaker versions and addresses key challenges, particularly accounting for unconscious intentional states. The program aims to ground all intentionality in consciousness while remaining compatible with physicalism through emergentist or functionalist accounts of phenomenology.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a systematic overview of how phenomenal intentionality theory addresses the grounding problem for meaning. For the SGP, the program suggests that computational symbol manipulation cannot constitute basic intentionality because it lacks phenomenology. However, symbols might have derived intentionality through relations to phenomenally conscious users. This framework helps clarify what assumptions about the nature of intentionality are in play when formulating the SGP - whether original or derived intentionality is at issue.

  POSITION: Phenomenal intentionality research program. Systematizes the view that phenomenology grounds all intentionality, with various derivative forms.

  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/9780262036146.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Neander defends teleosemantics against objections, arguing that mental content is determined by informational proper functions - what a mechanism was selected to indicate. She addresses the swampman problem, indeterminacy worries, and disjunction problems while arguing teleosemantics provides the best naturalistic account of content. Mental representation requires both information-carrying and having the proper function of carrying that information, where proper functions are fixed by selection history.

  RELEVANCE: Neander's sophisticated defense of teleosemantics clarifies how biological function grounds content, with implications for artificial systems. If content requires selection history, then engineered symbols lack intrinsic intentionality unless they acquire derived functions through cultural/technological evolution. This suggests the SGP might dissolve if we recognize that linguistic symbols have culturally-evolved proper functions rather than requiring grounding in individual minds. Her work helps assess whether the SGP presupposes anti-functionalist or anti-teleological meta-semantics.

  volume = {96},
  number = {2},
  pages = {232--251},
  doi = {10.5840/monist201396211},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Horgan argues for a strong version of phenomenal intentionality theory: all original (non-derived) intentionality is phenomenal intentionality. Unconscious states with apparent intentionality either (a) aren't genuinely intentional, or (b) have only derived intentionality borrowed from phenomenally conscious states, or (c) have narrow phenomenal character below the threshold of access consciousness. This eliminates any competition between phenomenal and non-phenomenal accounts of basic intentionality.

  RELEVANCE: Horgan's strong claim that original intentionality requires phenomenology has direct implications for symbol grounding. Computational symbols, lacking phenomenology, cannot have original intentionality on this view - they can only have derived intentionality through relations to conscious agents. This supports Searle-style arguments against computational semantics but from phenomenological rather than biological grounds. The position raises questions about whether the SGP presupposes that non-phenomenal states can have original intentionality.

  POSITION: Strong phenomenal intentionality thesis. All original intentionality is phenomenal; unconscious states have only derived intentionality.

  pages = {335--346},
  doi = {10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Harnad formulates the symbol grounding problem: how can formal symbol systems have meaning rather than being merely interpretable by external observers? Symbolic descriptions must eventually bottom out in non-symbolic representations (iconic and categorical) connected to the world through sensorimotor transduction. Pure symbol manipulation is insufficient - grounding requires hybrid systems combining symbolic and non-symbolic representations, where symbols inherit meaning from non-symbolic connections to perceptual categories.

  RELEVANCE: This is the canonical statement of the symbol grounding problem itself, making it essential background. Harnad's formulation assumes that grounding requires causal connections to the world through perception and categorization, reflecting internalist and individualist assumptions. His hybrid architecture proposal suggests one way forward, but philosophers might question whether he's identified the right kind of connection needed for meaning. The paper illustrates how cognitive science approaches to grounding make implicit meta-semantic assumptions.

  POSITION: Symbol grounding requires hybrid architecture connecting symbols to non-symbolic perceptual representations through sensorimotor transduction.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195311105.003.0011},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chalmers argues that phenomenal experience has representational content - there is phenomenal content that represents the world. He defends this against pure qualia views while remaining neutral on whether phenomenology exhausts representation. Chalmers develops the notion of Edenic content (content that cannot mislead) and argues phenomenal states represent properties as being instantiated in experience. This mediates between phenomenal intentionality views and purely informational accounts.

  RELEVANCE: Chalmers's account of phenomenal representation provides a middle ground between purely externalist and purely phenomenological approaches to intentionality. For the SGP, this suggests that representation requires phenomenal character but that character itself has representational structure. This complicates simple dichotomies between computational and phenomenal approaches - even if symbols need grounding in phenomenology, that phenomenology may have representational structure explicable in functional terms. Relevant for nuanced understanding of the consciousness-intentionality connection.

  POSITION: Phenomenal states have representational content. Moderate phenomenal intentionality view compatible with some representationalism.

  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682744.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Crane defends the intentionality of thought against reductivist and eliminativist views, arguing that intentionality is a genuine, irreducible feature of mentality. He develops an "actualist" account where intentional states are relations to actually existing intentional contents (which may be non-existent objects), rather than relations to existing objects. This allows mental states to be genuinely about non-existent things without committing to Meinongian ontology.

  RELEVANCE: Crane's account addresses puzzles about how mental states can be about non-existent or abstract objects, relevant for understanding what conditions must be met for symbols to genuinely refer. His rejection of naturalistic reduction of intentionality suggests that attempts to ground symbol meaning in purely causal-physical terms may be misguided - intentionality may be a sui generis feature requiring different explanatory resources. This challenges naturalistic assumptions potentially underlying the SGP formulation.

  POSITION: Intentional realism with actualist account of intentional objects. Intentionality is irreducible and not amenable to naturalistic reduction.

  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197501191.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pitt defends the view that propositional attitudes like beliefs have distinctive phenomenal character and that this phenomenal character constitutes their content. Thinking that Paris is beautiful is identical to a particular phenomenal state - the thought's content just is its phenomenology. This hardcore phenomenal intentionality view rejects any derivative or non-phenomenal intentionality, arguing all genuine intentionality is phenomenal.

  RELEVANCE: Pitt's extreme phenomenal intentionality view has radical implications for symbol grounding. If thought content is identical to phenomenology, then computational symbols manipulated without phenomenology cannot have any genuine intentionality, not even derived intentionality. This strongly supports Searle-style conclusions but raises questions about whether this makes intentionality explanatorily mysterious. The view represents the strongest challenge to computational semantics from phenomenology, relevant for understanding the full range of meta-semantic positions bearing on the SGP.

  pages = {47--68},
  doi = {10.1080/09515089.2011.625115},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Martínez addresses whether teleosemantics can account for the productivity and systematicity of thought - the capacity to entertain novel combinations of concepts. He argues that teleosemantic theories can explain productive capacities if proper functions can be compositional, though this requires either selection for compositional structures or emergent proper functions. The paper defends teleosemantics against a key objection from cognitive architecture.

  RELEVANCE: Productivity is central to human language and cognition, and if teleosemantics cannot explain it, this limits its adequacy for addressing symbol grounding. Martínez's defense suggests that biologically-grounded content can be compositional and productive, addressing worries that teleosemantics is too rigid for language. This bears on whether biological grounding (as opposed to computational grounding) can explain linguistic capacity - relevant for assessing whether the SGP presupposes computational meta-semantics.

  pages = {95--125},
  doi = {10.1163/18756735-00000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Textor reconstructs Brentano's notion of act content, arguing that for Brentano, the content of a mental act is identified with combinations of marks (Merkmale) or single marks. This interpretation places Brentano's view in historical context and defends it against objections, clarifying how Brentano understood intentional directedness as intrinsic to mental acts rather than as a relation to external objects.

  RELEVANCE: Understanding Brentano's original formulation of intentionality provides historical background for contemporary debates. Brentano's view that intentionality is intrinsic to mental acts (not a relation to external objects) anticipates phenomenal intentionality theories and contrasts with externalist causal theories. This historical perspective helps clarify how different meta-semantic assumptions have shaped the development of theories relevant to symbol grounding - whether intentionality is intrinsic or relational, a foundational divide.
