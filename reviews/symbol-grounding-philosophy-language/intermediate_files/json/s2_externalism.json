      "abstract": "The semantic internalist\u2013externalist debate is one of the central themes in contemporary philosophy. The present paper aims to explore the dispute between \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and his opponents over the meaning of words (\u015babd\u0101rtha) in the \u015babd\u0101rthapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 chapter from the perspective of the internalist\u2013externalist debate in semantics. The present paper consists of three main parts. In the first part, I will elucidate the internalist character of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s apoha theory and the externalist characters of his opponents\u2019 theories. The second part will be an examination of an Indian Externalist Argument against \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s apoha presented in the chapter. In the third part, I will explore how \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita attempts to refute this argument by resorting to the Dharmak\u012brtian notion of adhyavas\u0101ya (false ascertainment). Additionally, to emphasize a contemporary approach, I will offer and highlight the intercultural interpretations of these Indian externalist and internalist arguments.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In his 1975 paper \u201cThe Meaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d, Hilary Putnam famously argued for semantic externalism. Little attention has been paid, however, to the fact that already in 1973, Putnam had presented the idea of the linguistic division of labour and the Twin Earth thought experiment in his comment on Wilfrid Sellars\u2019 \u201cMeaning as Functional Classification\u201d at a conference, and Sellars had replied to Putnam from a broadly inferentialist perspective. The first half of this paper aims to trace the development of Putnam\u2019s semantic externalism, situate his debate with Sellars in it, and reconstruct the two arguments he presented against Sellars. The second half of this paper aims to reconstruct how Sellars replied to Putnam. I argue that Sellars not only accepts the social character of language but also suggests how inferentialists can accommodate the contribution of the world. Sellars\u2019 key idea is that substance terms have a \u2018promissory note aspect\u2019 which is to be cashed out in a successor conceptual framework. I reconstruct Sellars\u2019 position as ideal successor externalism, and compare it with temporal externalism.",

      "abstract": "The main question of metasemantics, or foundational semantics, is why an expression token has the meaning (semantic value) that it in fact has. In his reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s later work, Saul Kripke presented a skeptical challenge that threatened to make the foundational question unanswerable. My first contention in this paper is that the skeptical challenge indeed poses an insoluble paradox, but only for a certain kind of metasemantic theory, against which the challenge effectively works as a reductio ad absurdum argument. My second contention is that as a result of rejecting the theory which entails a paradoxical outcome, we will see that the foundational question essentially involves a temporal dimension. After arguing that the skeptical challenge gives us a strong reason to adopt a historical view of meaning, I shall further argue against certain authors who claim that meanings not only have histories but futures as well, or that the meaning of a word may change retroactively in time as a consequence of counterfactual change in its future use. The major aim of the paper is thus to bring together the arguably interrelated debates about the skeptical challenge and temporal externalism in philosophy of language.",

Sally Haslanger has argued that metasemantic externalism justifies the seemingly counterintuitive consequences of her proposed conceptual revisions. But according to Herman Cappelen, metasemantic externalism makes conceptual engineering effectively impossible in practice. After raising objections to Haslanger\u2019s and Cappelen\u2019s views, I argue for a very different picture, on which metasemantic externalism bears very little on conceptual engineering. I argue that, while metasemantic externalism principally operates at the level of semantic-meaning, we should understand conceptual engineering to operate largely at the level of speaker-meaning. This \u2018Speaker-Meaning Picture\u2019 has two key benefits. Firstly, it makes conceptual engineering often easy in practice. Secondly, it suggests a new, normative response to the well known objection that conceptual engineering serves only to change the subject.",

However, despite references to it in foundational works and Cappelen\u2019s incorporation of it into conceptual engineering, its theoretical foundations remain largely unexplored. This paper clarifies the relationship between Cappelen's externalist conceptual engineering and dynamic externalism, distinguishing their operational and meta-level structures. Through a critical analysis of Woodfield and Burge, this paper develops an expert-centric approach to dynamic externalism that integrates the core principles of future externalism while proposing a modified version with an inverted direction of fit. The approach employs this expert-centric framework to provide explanatory resources for semantic change in specialized domains. The resulting account emphasizes the interplay between synchronic and diachronic relations, identifies mechanisms driving semantic evolution, and offers a systematic framework for understanding how technical terminology develops within expert communities.",

Social externalism, which holds that semantic meaning is determined by the usage of experts within a linguistic community, seems to offer a path to controlled implementation. This paper argues that this route encounters serious obstacles in politically and socially significant cases. Drawing on Ball's (2020) distinction between Power Metasemantics and Virtue Metasemantics, the paper presents challenges for both perspectives. Power Metasemantics makes it very difficult for marginalized groups to bring about meaning change, as it is sensitive to how structural inequalities affect distributions of credibility and authority\u2014though implementation remains possible. Virtue Metasemantics, on the other hand, faces epistemic and structural problems that may lend support to Cappelen's (2018) skepticism about implementation.",

Accordingly, Clark and Chalmers (Analysis 58(1):7\u201319, 1998) distinguish these varieties of externalism as \u2018passive\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 respectively. The aim here is to suggest that we should resist the received way of thinking about these dividing lines. With reference to Brandom\u2019s (1994, 2000, Inquiry 47:236\u2013253, 2008) broad semantic inferentialism, we show that a theory of meaning can be at the same time a variety of active externalism. While we grant that supporters of other varieties of content externalism (e.g., Putnam 1975 and Burge (Philosophical Review 95:3\u201345, 1986) can deny active externalism, this is not an option for semantic inferentialists: On this latter view, the role of the environment (both in its social and natural form) is not \u2018passive\u2019 in the sense assumed by the alternative approaches to content externalism.",

      "abstract": "\n Metasemantics studies the foundations of meaning, asking what makes it the case that certain words have the meanings that they do. But what makes metasemantic theories true? This question has been all but ignored in philosophy of language. In this book, Cohnitz and Haukioja address this issue and argue that just as in metasemantics, both internalist and externalist answers are available for this foundational question.\n The authors introduce and defend meta-internalism, arguing that the foundations of reference and meaning are anchored in the individual dispositions and psychological states of language users, offering an alternative to meta-externalist views that would appeal to broader community-based or otherwise external factors. Meta-internalism is, moreover, compatible with semantic externalism as usually understood, and provides an explanation of why externalism is true. Through a critical examination of prominent theories and thought experiments, the book explores fundamental issues like reference failure, conceptual engineering, and the metaphysical implications of reference, as well as the methodology of theories of reference. With its focus on the foundations of metasemantics, the book provides a fresh and empirically informed perspective on one of the core questions in the philosophy of language. Foundations for Metasemantics is essential reading for philosophers, scholars, and students seeking to understand the underlying principles that support our theories of meaning and reference.",
