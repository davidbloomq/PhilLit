      "abstract": "Since the publication of Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language by Saul Kripke, there have been controversial interpretations of what it means by \u2018rule following\u2019 with regard to the question of meaning. Kripke maintains that Wittgenstein\u2019s paradox of rule following demands us to consider what mental or behavioral items could constitute meaning. This boils down, according to Kripke, to the conclusion that either of the choice ends up with a dilemma which calls for a solution yet again to yield another sceptical solution. Rivals to Kripke like McDowell and Wright have argued that if we seriously read Wittgenstein we realise that a dispositional choice is plausible. Others like Patrizio Lo Presti, for example, have defended Wittgenstein by positing that there is no need to separate mental and behvioral items in the first place and that Wittgenstein is misinterpreted. Following this line of thinking, this paper contends that rule following is an essential criteria for Wittgenstein theory of meaning as use. It takes the view that if the paradox forces us to make a choice then it is plausible to choose behavioral items as satisfying rule following and so meaning. The paper thus adopts the position that, when discussing the concept of language game to the conclusion that the meaning of a word is but its use, Wittgenstein successfully uses the concept of rule following to reach this conclusion. Simply, meaning as use is realized when people follow the rules of language. They are neither written rules nor syntactical rules but semantic rules of language based on context. Thus, in our daily conversations and practical life humans tend to follow rules, sometimes without being familiar with that, to successfully understand each other and take actions on various issues at hand. This begins right from the moment we learn language.",

Because hate speech is mainly transmitted in text form on social media, linguistic analysis is required to determine the meaning of the hate speech. This study aims to look at the view of hate speech on social media using a literature study technique based on the Wittgenstein language game theory approach. According to Wittgenstein, language does not have a single logical structure but is complicated in its use in human life, which spans a wide range of activities. Previous research has looked at the meaning linked with language use in social media. As Wittgenstein proposes, the finding of the research is That ordinary language collected through social media data may be utilized to offer direct answers to social scientific questions. Online media that allows people to represent themselves and cooperate to share, connect with other users, and form virtual social relationships are referred to as social media. Starting with the presentation of quotes, there will be a \"language game\" with the concept of \"from, by, and for.\" Finally, the author proposes using two markers to analyze hate speech on social media: typology and message content",

      "abstract": "Any theory of language \u2013 ancient or contemporary, philosophical or cognitive \u2013 faces the same problem, i.e. how to reconcile the unequivocally corporeal character of the speakers and the world they speak of with the somewhat \u2018incorporeal\u2019 character of the meanings of linguistic expressions. It is for this reason, for example, that direct-reference theories of language (Stroll 1999) seek to eliminate the Fregean notion of 'sense' (Sinn) from semantics. What is at stake is a completely corporeal account of language. However, such an attempt clashes with the fact that the vast majority of linguistic expressions do not refer either to any objects in the world or to the pre-scientific intuition that words have an autonomous 'meaning' (that is, that the 'sense' of a word does not coincide with the referent, Bedeutung). \nTo solve such a problem, the Stoics introduced in their theory of language the notion of lekton, i.e. what is 'said' or is 'sayable'. Even if the lekton is, properly speaking, incorporeal, at the same time it is the corporeal product of what human speakers do when they utter a verbal utterance. In this paper I propose to compare the notion of lekton to the similar notion of 'use' (Gebrauch), much debated in Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations. The thesis of this paper is not that there exists a direct philological connection between the Stoic notion of lekton and the notion of linguistic 'use' in Wittgenstein (even if this cannot be excluded either). Instead, the idea is that when one wants to propose an adequate theory of language, one cannot but introduce a notion such as that of lekton or 'use'.",

Scholars such as Bouveresse (1995) and Cioffi (2009) have explored Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of the unconscious, while McGuinness (2002) examined their intellectual relationship, and Harcourt (2017) addressed Wittgenstein\u2019s ties to psychoanalysis. Despite recent efforts to connect Wittgenstein\u2019s work with psychology, little attention has been given to the subject that intrigued Wittgenstein most: dreams. His interest in hypnotic phenomena and dream interpretation significantly predates his engagement with Freud (cf. Monk 1990; McGuinness 1988). This paper explores Wittgenstein\u2019s engagement with dreams, primarily as reflected in his \u201cConversations on Freud\u201d. This analysis will address issues related to the philosophy of science\u2014such as evidence, explanation, and justification\u2014as well as key concerns in Wittgenstein\u2019s work, including his concept of meaning as use and his notion of change of aspect. While Wittgenstein ultimately rejected Freud\u2019s theory due to its scientific and philosophical shortcomings, his admiration for it mirrored his regard for Darwin and Copernicus: not flawless, but profoundly generative.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT My topic is Wittgenstein\u2019s eventual abandonment of his Tractatus idea that a sentence is true if and only if it depicts a possible fact that obtains, and his coming (in the Investigations) to replace this with a deflationary view of truth. Three objections to the initial idea that will be discussed here are: (i) that its theory of \u2018depiction\u2019 relies on an unexplicated concept of word-object reference; (ii) that its notion of a possible fact obtaining (or existing, or being actual, or agreeing with reality) is also left mysterious; and (iii) that Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of possible atomic facts makes it difficult to see how any of them could fail to be actual. These problems are resolved by deflationism. But that perspective could not have been incorporated into the Tractatus. For the view of \u2018meaning qua use\u2019, on which deflationism depends, was the key insight enabling Wittgenstein to appreciate the untenability of his other central Tractarian doctrines. I\u2019ll conclude the paper with an examination of Jos\u00e9 Zalabardo\u2019s quite different reading of the book, and indicate where and why I\u2019m not persuaded by it.",

The focus of the study is directed toward the phenomenon of memes, emojis, abbreviations, and popular expressions that have rapidly developed on social media platforms and often deviate from their standard meanings. The research employs a descriptive qualitative method using content analysis combined with a philosophical literature review. Data were obtained from various digital platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter/X, as well as relevant academic sources. The results indicate that semantic shifts in digital language occur through patterns of meaning expansion, metaphorization, polysemy, and linguistic innovation. From the standpoint of the philosophy of language, these findings align with Wittgenstein's meaning is use theory and Austin's speech act theory, both of which emphasize that meaning is determined by the practical use of language and speech acts within social contexts. Thus, the changes in meaning in digital culture are not merely linguistic but also reflect the social, cultural, and technological dynamics that shape modern communication patterns.",

In this theory, the non-factual is positioned outside the boundaries of language.

In addition, Wittgenstein reconsiders the problem of meaning in the context of the use of language in his late works and makes some corrections in his views. Wittgenstein, who was previously influenced by the view that only the factual can be meaningful, which was discussed in the Vienna circle, also settles on a position related to mysticism.

      "abstract": "Language and Thought in Wittgenstein \u2013 is the theme of this preparation and aims to highlight the contributions of Ludwig Wittgenstein in the reflection on the philosophy of language. Wittgenstein discusses the problems of language in two important works, (Tratactus and Philosophical Investigations) that comprise the phases of the development of his thought, that is, the First Wittgenstein and the Second Wittgenstein. In the Tractatus, language is analyzed outside the concrete circumstances in which it is used in the context of life, while in the Philosophical Investigations the emphasis is on stating that the meaning of linguistic statements is conferred by their use in the context of social practices. Wittgensteinian thought in its first phase speaks of language as a logical mirror of reality, fixed through elementary propositions that have their foundation in the theory of figuration. The second Wittgenstein conceives language based on its different uses, abandoning the essence of language and, therefore, its limits imposed by the logical world. For Wittgenstein, language fulfills a representative function, because through it people can represent their experiences in different ways, moreover, language is a social practice connected to a form of action in the world. Finally, given the influence of the environment on language, it is no longer separated from human life in its essence of creating, recreating and expressing thought. To carry out this study, the method of bibliographical review was preferred, which allowed us to conclude that the First Wittgenstein (Tratactus) constitutes a way of adapting language to the desire for metaphysical knowledge of reality and, with the Second Wittgenstein (Philosophical Investigations), the Language reveals the complex nature of man's being and his intellectual superiority.",

      "abstract": "Wittgenstein was an innovative philosopher who has provoked reactions ranging from veneration to vexation to outright hostility. The so-called early Wittgenstein was influential for logical positivism; his first work, the Tractatus, was taken up as a bible of sorts; the so-called later Wittgenstein was decisive for the linguistic turn and ushered in the term \u201cmeaning as use\u201d through his posthumously published Philosophical Investigations (2009). Although Wittgenstein\u2019s approach to philosophy continues to have its advocates, it seems safe to say that a Wittgensteinian revolution in how philosophers are meant to do philosophy has not occurred, nor is it likely to any time soon. Are the prospects better for psychology, a discipline in which Wittgenstein seems to have had some interest but wherein his brief and characteristically elliptical remarks were more likely intended as an application of his approach to philosophy? This seems even less likely. However, the point of academic scholarship, at least in the modern academy, is typically not to engender a radical shift in the way that practitioners conduct their research and understand its purpose. But there are relevant exceptions. For example, fairly sweeping claims have been made that root social constructionist and discursive approaches to psychology in Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy; some even advocate for a new paradigm based on his work (e.g., Harr\u00e9 & Tissaw, 2005). There seems to be a tension though in using the notoriously anti-theoretical Wittgenstein to construct what are to be construed as roughly general theories, let alone metatheoretical paradigms. More modestly, Wittgenstein can be understood to offer some tools that can be of potential use in psychology chiefly for clarifying empirical and theoretical statements, avoiding unnecessary disputes, and even constructing more fruitful research. It was therefore a delight to discover that, in Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy in Psychology: Interpretations and Applications in Historical Context, Sullivan addresses these more practical versus theory-heavy understandings of Wittgenstein in an ambitious attempt to explain Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy to and through the work of psychologists. His main goal is to defend what one could call a middle-ground position that is true to Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy while at the same time showing how Wittgensteinian conceptual analytic tools can be deployed without abstracting into theory and metatheory, and allowing 874403 TAP0010.1177/0959354319874403Theory & PsychologyReview product-review2019",

In this paper, I will argue that Davidson\u2019s later works on meaning can be seen as mainly a manifestation of his attempt to accommodate the later Wittgenstein\u2019s basic ideas about meaning and understanding, especially the requirement of drawing the seems right/is right distinction and the way this requirement must be met. These ideas, however, are interpreted by Davidson in his own way. I will then argue that Davidson even attempts to respect Wittgenstein\u2019s quietism, provided that we understand this view in the way Davidson does. Having argued for that, I will finally investigate whether, for Davidson at least, his more theoretical and supposedly explanatory projects, such as that of constructing a formal theory of meaning and his use of the notion of triangulation, are in conflict with this Wittgensteinian quietist view.",

Austen (the name-drop in the title of Moi\u2019s book is misleading), and as read by Stanley Cavell. Over the course of a brisk, ten chapter-long book, Moi takes us on a journey in three sections. In the first part, \u201cWittgenstein,\u201d Moi offers a brief but lucid presentation of some of the key concepts of Wittgenstein\u2019s language philosophy\u2014meaning, use, language-games, grammar, and forms of life\u2014followed by a genuinely exemplary discussion of how these concepts work against both alternative views of language and as a means of rereading what are taken to be theoretical \u201cproblems,\u201d in this case, intersectionality. In the second part, \u201cDifferences,\u201d she expands from these arguments to show how language philosophy exposes the problems with \u201ctheory,\u201d which here essentially means various forms of thought connected to structuralism and poststructuralism, and outlines the limits and deficits of \u201ccritique.\u201d And finally in the third part, \u201cReading,\u201d she sets out to posit a future of literary studies in which the efforts of \u201ctheory\u201d to generalize reading are supplanted by greater attention to the specifics of our own experience with texts, the ways in which texts act on us, and other moods of reading which may already sound familiar to readers of recent arguments in favor of postcritique.",

      "abstract": "\n In the middle of the 20th century, it was a common Wittgenstein-inspired idea in philosophy that languages are analogous to games and for a linguistic expression to have a meaning in a language is for it to be governed by a rule of use. However, due to the influence of David Lewis\u2019s work it is now standard to understand meaningfulness in terms of conventional regularities in use instead (Lewis 1969, 1975).\n In this paper I will present a simplified Lewis-inspired Conventions view which embodies the basic idea and argue that it is inferior to the older Rules view. Every theory of meaningfulness in a language must yield a plausible story of what it is to speak the language, that is, of what it is to use an expression with its meaning. Those who have adopted something like the Conventions view standardly take use with meaning to consist in trying to use the expression in the conventionally regular way (Lewis 1969, Davis 2003, Loar 1981). I argue that this proposal fails since use with meaning is compatible with intentional misuses. In contrast, on the Rules view we can take use with meaning to be analogous to making a move in the game and to consist in using it while the rule is in force for one which is compatible with intentionally breaking it. And nothing structurally analogous can be found on the Conventions view without inflating it into the Rules view, which completes the case against it.",

      "abstract": "Rudi Keller has presented an instrumental conception of the sign which defines the meaning of the linguistic sign as a 'rule of use' and which is directed against the classical theory of representation or substitution as an alternative. In doing so, he draws upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophische Untersuchungen and Ernst Tugendhat's Einf\u00fchrung in die sprachanalytische Philosophie. Since Tugendhat also adopts Wittgenstein\u00b4s concept of the rule of use, but, unlike Keller, uses it to elucidate the representational performance of language, I should like to discuss the relationship between these definitions of meaning (meaning as representational content vs. meaning as a rule of use) in the work of both thinkers. By doing so, I will hold that language is not initially a means of communication and that the perspective and research methods adopted from the natural sciences, as we find them in Keller's pragmatic meaning theory, are unsuitable for the human sciences. More precisely, my essay presents a) Keller's theory of meaning, b) Tugendhat's criticism of Grice's perlocutionism, c) Roman Jakobson's reasons for keeping (isolated) word-understanding and (contextual) word-utilisation apart. Finally, Joseph Levine's model example is shown in explaining d) the inapplicability of the scientific method in the field of human science.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the meaning Ludwig Wittgenstein assigns to the concept of \"grammar\" in his late philosophy, a notion both close to and distinct from its common usage in linguistics or philology. Grammar, in his view, refers both to the project of describing the use and rules of language, and to the rules themselves. As such, grammar is the system of rules that makes meaning possible, and it is intersubjective, implicit, and non-theoretical in nature. Grammatical remarks or propositions\u2012unlike empirical ones \u2012 do not convey new information, but clarify what is already operative in ordinary language use. Through concrete examples \u2012 such as the analysis of the proposition \"I am here\" \u2012 this paper shows how removing utterances from their context of use leads to philosophical confusion. From this perspective, Wittgensteinian grammar does not propose-a theory of language, but a form of recollection aimed at restoring clarity in the face of the fascination exerted by our ways of speaking.",

      "abstract": "According to the ideational theory of meaning held by most seventeenth- and eighteenth- century European philosophers, meaningful words signify ideas in the mind of the speaker. This view was famously rejected by Berkeley. Some interpreters hold that in rejecting this view Berkeley meant merely to carve out some exceptions to the general principle that meaningful words stand for ideas. Others attribute to Berkeley the view that, rather than signifying ideas, words signify speaker intentions. Finally, some interpreters attribute to Berkeley a use theory of language similar to the later Wittgenstein. This chapter provides an overview of this interpretive debate and a defense of the use theory interpretation.",
