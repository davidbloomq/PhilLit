      "snippet": "Sticking with unionism for the moment, we can say that, as any ground contributes to explaining what it grounds, any ground is a partial ground. But not all partial grounds provide fully adequate explanations of what they ground, so not all partial grounds are full grounds. A merely partial ground is a partial ground that isn\u2019t a full ground. By grounding we henceforth mean partial grounding.",

Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. (Lewis 1970: 19) Lewis was right. Even if philosophers have not consistently kept these two questions separate, there clearly is a distinction between the questions \u201cWhat is the meaning of this or that symbol (for a particular person or group)?\u201d and \u201cIn virtue of what facts about that person or group does the symbol have that meaning?\u201d",
