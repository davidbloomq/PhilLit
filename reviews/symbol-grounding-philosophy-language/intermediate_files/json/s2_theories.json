      "abstract": "The Buddhist theory of Apoha (exclusion) offers a distinct and non-essentialist approach to meaning and cognition by rejecting intrinsic universals and elucidating linguistic categorization through negation. Rooted in the epistemological and logical traditions of Indian Buddhism, Apoha was systematically formulated by Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti as a counterargument to realist theories of meaning, which assert the existence of inherent essences corresponding to linguistic categories. Instead of postulating a positive universal, Apoha posits that words acquire meaning by excluding what they do not denote. For instance, the term \"cow\" does not signify an inherent cow-ness but instead differentiates cows from non-cows. This exclusion-based model of meaning challenges ontological realism and presents an alternative perspective in which meaning is derived through negation rather than intrinsic identity.This paper examines Apoha in relation to contemporary cognitive science, particularly in the contexts of category formation, prototype theory, and conceptual blending. Empirical research in cognitive science indicates that human categorization operates through flexible, context-sensitive processes rather than rigid universals, thereby aligning with the Buddhist view that meaning is constructed rather than inherent. Engaging with contemporary debates in the philosophy of language and cognitive semantics, this study positions Apoha in dialogue with alternative theoretical frameworks, including Aristotelian essentialism, Fregean reference theory, and Wittgensteinian perspectives on language. Through this comparative analysis, the paper explores how Apoha challenges foundational assumptions concerning meaning, reference, and conceptual representation.Furthermore, this study critically engages with objections to Apoha, particularly those advanced by the Ny\u0101ya School, which argues that exclusion alone is insufficient for a comprehensive account of linguistic meaning. Ny\u0101ya philosophers contend that Apoha leads to an infinite regress or circular reasoning, as negation presupposes some form of positive content. By reassessing these critiques within the framework of cognitive science, this paper demonstrates how Apoha can be reinterpreted as a viable model for understanding the construction and communication of meaning, particularly in light of contemporary non-essentialist approaches to language. By integrating Buddhist epistemology with modern linguistic and cognitive theories, this study highlights the enduring significance of Apoha in contemporary discussions on language and cognition. The exclusion-based model of meaning proposed by Apoha aligns with non-essentialist and usage-based linguistic frameworks, offering valuable insights into how meaning is generated through contrast, differentiation, and contextual dependence. In doing so, this research underscores Apoha not only as a pivotal contribution to Indian philosophy but also as a theoretically robust and philosophically compelling framework for modern cognitive and linguistic inquiry.",

Building on this view, it explores how such an instrumentalist framework can engage critically with various concerns raised by Wittgenstein, Quine, and Kripke[nstein]\u2014each of whom voiced scepticism toward certain conceptions of semantic theorising and, in some cases, the reification of meaning. While the scope and nature of their respective criticisms may differ, the paper suggests they share a broadly deflationary attitude toward semantic metaphysics. Twentieth\u2010century challenges to mainstream truth\u2010conditional semantics, from verificationism, inferentialism, and other alternatives, have further complicated the semantic landscape, prompting a reconsideration of metaphysical assumptions in theories of meaning. In light of both scepticism about meaning and explanatory disagreement in semantics, the paper questions the metaphysical interpretation of theories of meaning and proposes a reoriented understanding of semantic theorising\u2014one that is formally tractable yet philosophically restrained.",

Specifically, we consider (1) the model-theoretic semantics (i.e., extensional semantics), (2) the possible-world semantics (i.e., intensional semantics), (3) the situation semantics, and (4) the cognitive/distributional semantics. Given the peculiarities of the Internet of Things, we pay particular attention to (a)\u00a0perception (i.e., how to establish a connection to the world), (b)\u00a0intersubjectivity (i.e., how to align world representations), and (c)\u00a0the dynamics of world knowledge (i.e., how to model events). We come to the conclusion that each of the semantic theories helps in modeling specific aspects, but does not sufficiently address all three aspects simultaneously.",

Also relates the theory of frames to these type theories as introducing, to some extent, similar structure into semantic analysis. The authors show how a structured approach is necessary to appropriately analyse phenomena in areas as diverse as lexical semantics and the semantics of attitudinal constructions referring to psychological states. In particular, these are: polysemy taken together with copredication, and attitudes such as belief and knowledge. The authors argue that the very same structure required to define a rich system of types enables them to adequately analyse both of these phenomena, thus revealing similarities in two otherwise apparently unrelated topics in semantics. They also argue that such theories facilitate a semantic theory oriented towards a psychological and contextually situated view of meaning.

This synthesis holds significance for both AGI and broader debates concerning the nature of language, as it unifies pragmatics, logical truth conditional semantics, Peircean semiotics, and a computable model of enactive cognition, addressing phenomena that have traditionally evaded mechanistic explanation. By examining the conditions under which a machine can generate meaningful utterances or comprehend human meaning, we establish that the current generation of language models do not possess the same understanding of meaning as humans nor intend any meaning that we might attribute to their responses. To address this, we propose simulating human feelings and optimising models to construct weak representations. Our findings shed light on the relationship between meaning and intelligence, and how we can build machines that comprehend and intend meaning.",

In an adapted form, it can be modified as: As you are, so you think; as you think, so you mean. In his extension of semantics to ka:rmatics in dealing with proverb-meaning, Bhuvaneswar (2012) has shown a new dimension of meaning and meaning-making, namely, the causal dimension of creation, change, and transformation of meaning in language. According to Bhuvaneswar, if semantics deals with sentence meaning and pragmatics with utterance meaning, ka:rmatics (i.e., experiential pragmatics) explores experiential meaning via dispositional meaning of contextual meaning (pragmatics) of sentential meaning (semantics). What this amounts to is a causal understanding of meaning as it is created, changed, and transformed as languages are evolved and developed: Language is as it is (i.e., lingual meaning is as it is) because of what it is (dispositionally) intended to do (i.e., to mean) what it does (i.e., means). \nIn this paper, an attempt has been made by selecting two sentences used in real life Yemeni Arabic to show how meaning is derived. In the process, it will be shown how semantics becomes pragmatics and pragmatics becomes ka:rmatics.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The digital age has transformed the way humans use, interpret, and experience language. Traditional philosophical concerns\u2014such as meaning, reference, truth, and communication\u2014must now be re-examined in the context of new linguistic practices shaped by digital technologies. Social media platforms, artificial intelligence, emojis, memes, and algorithm-driven interactions have introduced novel forms of expression that challenge conventional theories of semantics and pragmatics. This paper explores the philosophical implications of digital communication, focusing on how meaning is constructed, negotiated, and altered in virtual spaces. It examines the interplay between brevity and nuance in online discourse, the impact of anonymity and identity fluidity on speech acts, and the ethical dimensions of language mediated by algorithms. \nResults/Analysis: The digital age has not only revolutionized the tools of communication but also redefined the very nature of linguistic interaction. Classical philosophy of language, grounded in speech and text, must now be reinterpreted in light of digital practices that are multimodal, fragmented, and technologically mediated. Meaning today is not limited to words alone; it is constructed through symbols, images, hashtags, and even silence within algorithmically curated platforms.\nMethodology: In this paper, the exploratory qualitative research method is used. The relevant information is collected using keyword-based search in Google search engine, Google Scholar search engine, and AI-driven GPTs. This information is analysed and interpreted as per the objectives of the paper.\nOriginality/Values: The study engages with contemporary questions of authenticity, misinformation, and linguistic creativity in digital environments. By bridging classical philosophy of language with the realities of digital communication, the paper argues for an expanded framework that accounts for multimodal, networked, and technologically mediated forms of meaning-making. Ultimately, rethinking language in the digital age offers not only a deeper understanding of communication but also an opportunity to develop more ethical and inclusive linguistic practices in a rapidly evolving world.",

First is the thesis that the range of linguistic features that can be considered authentically semantic is far wider in breadth than is typically acknowledged. In particular, linguistic phenomena that are entirely orthogonal to veridical considerations\u2014including ethical matters\u2014are sufficiently robust to support e.g. theories of meaning and inference. Second, we aim to argue that philosophy\u2019s prioritization of truth obscures the existence of an important prior concern for care or the reduction of harm. Specifically, we offer a topic-theoretic interpretation of the bounds consequence reading of sequents put forward by Restall and Ripley. We argue that this reading allows us to provide a rigorous semantics using the newly introduced categories of care and harm. An important objection may be that philosophy requires the centrality and priority of truth above all else insofar as truth-like features are necessary to ground theories of meaning or reasoning. Anticipating such an objection, we will argue that care not only is an authentically semantic feature but also that care is sufficient to ground such theories.",

      "abstract": "One of the greatest problems in philosophy is that of meaning. The turning point in thinking on meaning was Tarski\u2019s definition of truth, and the rapid development of logical semantics and model theory was a consequence of this achievement. Prhaps less well-known among classical logicians and philosophers is that it is category theory that provides the requisite mathematical tools to study the relationship between the syntax of formalized theories and their semantics. The aim of this article is to change this situation and make a preliminary philosophical analysis of the results obtained so far. They concern formalized algebraic theories with axioms in the form of equational laws, theories based on propositional logic and coherent Boolean logic, as well as decidable logic which is not necessarily Boolean. The syntactic-semantics relation for these theories takes the form of dualisms between the respective syntactic and semantic categories. These dualisms are given by the appropriate adjoint functors. In all the considered cases, the syntax\u2013semantics dualism corresponds to the algebra-geometry dualism. We analyze the philosophical significance of these results. They allow us to look at the problem of meaning in a new light and formulate a criterion distinguishing formal theories from empirical theories. The disputes that were once fought over Tarski\u2019s definition of truth are transferred to a new context. The polemics as to whether Tarski actually succeeded in reducing the problem of meaning to purely syntactic terms has been superseded:",

Addressing the problem is relevant for the philosophy of computer science in the context of the debate of whether simulative programs can be considered representational theories of their simulated systems. This paper challenges the thesis that, since programming languages have semantics, they also have reference, presumably to the external world. First, denotational, operational, game theoretic, and axiomatic semantics are epistemologically analysed to provide a theory of meaning for high-level language programs. It is argued that programming language semantics can be seen, to some extent, under the light of Fregean descriptivism, thereby rejecting the view that it is reference that determines meaning. Secondly, descriptivist, causal, character, and intentionalist theories of reference are examined to argue that meaning is not sufficient for programming languages to determine reference, thereby rejecting the view that meaning determines reference. It is argued that it is the intentions of agents that allow programming language semantics to identify referents. The paper concludes that if the semantics of programming languages may determine their reference, the latter is not to the external world but to the internal operations of the implementation executing them. This does not prevent simulative programs from representing empirical systems, but they do so not on the basis of programming language semantics.",

There are now sophisticated theories of phenomena that were not even known to exist mere decades ago. Much of the early work in natural language semantics was accompanied by extensive reflection on the aims of semantic theory, and the form a theory must take to meet those aims. But this meta-theoretical reflection has not kept pace with recent theoretical innovations. The aim of this volume is to re-address these questions concerning the foundations of natural language semantics in light of the current state-of-the-art in semantic theorizing. The volume addresses a range of foundational questions about formal semantics: what is the best methodology for semantic theorizing, and should experimental techniques play a crucial role? How should we understand the use of formal tools such as model theory, and are there better formal alternatives? How should we think about compositionality? What does semantic theory tell us about the language faculty or linguistic competence? What are the advantages of dynamic semantics? How do formal semantic theories relate to philosophical notions of context, content, interpretation, and propositions?",

      "abstract": "There are many theories of meaning such as semantic theories (Rusellianism, fregeanism, Possible World Semantics, Davidsonianism, Internalist theories, etc and foundational theories of meaning (Gricean Program, interpretational theories, etc). Philosophers of language such as Russell, Frege, Grice, Davidson, and Chomskyan internalists have constructed theories of meaning by focusing on the following elements as meaning determiners: referent, property, thought, circumstances, truth-condition, intention, language faculty, interpretation, causes, use, representations, and idea. None of these philosophers of language has thought of \u201cspeaker\u2019s need\u201d which is the core element on which the above elements are based in order to state what determines meaning. Therefore, the objective of this article is to demonstrate how the perception of the speaker\u2019s need by the listener or hearer determines meaning in a linguistic communication. This demonstration is based on the results of a research conducted in Bonzola Hospital (a hospital in Mbujimayi City in Democratic Republic of Congo. The data in this study were collected through observation and interview. The observation consisted in attending the interaction between doctors and patients so as to listen to their utterances and watch their gestures, facial expressions, actions and whatever can occur during their communication. As far as the analysis of data is concerned, the Conversation Analysis was used so as to analyze the utterances, facial expressions, actions, gestures, and other elements that can occur in communication between doctors and patients. The results show clearly that the conveyance and reception of meaning does not depend mainly on referent, property, thought, circumstances, truth-condition, intention, language faculty, interpretation, causes, use, representations, and idea but the conveyance and reception of meaning depend on the perception of the speaker\u2019s need by the listener or hearer. The interpretation of the results led to the conclusion that meaning is determined by the perception of the speaker\u2019s need by the listener or hearer.",

F. de Saussure\u2019s dichotomy concerning paradigmatic/syntagmatic aspects of meaning finds its further interpretation in various theoretical models, especially in the field of pragmatics and the philosophy of language. Among them the works of M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hassan, as well as of P. Ricoeur could serve as a point of departure in explaining some newer and sophisticated cases of grammaticalization. The paper focuses on examples of the exchange of mental patterns, clich\u00e9s and frozen expressions due to contemporary language contacts. Keywords: verb semantics, clause predicate semantics, paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic meaning, lexical taxonomies, cross-lingual exchange of conceptualizations and grammaticalization patterns",

First, to motivate a puzzle about how ignorance-expressing terms like maybe and if interact: they (surprisingly) iterate, and when they do they exhibit scopelessness. Second, to argue that there is an ambiguity in our theoretical toolbox, and that exposing that opens the door to a solution to the puzzle. And third, to explore the reach of that solution (it turns out to do work in unexpected places). Along the way, the paper highlights a number of pleasing properties of two elegant semantic theories (data semantics and update semantics), explores some meta-theoretic properties of dynamic notions of meaning, dips its toe into some hazardous waters (epistemic contradictions and presupposition projection), and offers characterization theorems for the space of meanings an indicative conditional can have.",
