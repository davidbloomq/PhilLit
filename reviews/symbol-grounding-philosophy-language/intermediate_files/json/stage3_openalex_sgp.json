The symbol grounding problem. Physica D, : 335\u2013346. [Google Scholar]). After a concise introduction, the paper provides an analysis of the requirement that must be satisfied by any hypothesis seeking to solve the SGP, the zero semantical commitment condition. It is then used to assess the eight strategies, which are organized into three main approaches: representationalism, semi-representationalism and non-representationalism. The conclusion is that all the strategies are semantically committed and hence that none of them provides a valid solution to the SGP, which remains an open problem.",

A solution to this symbol\u2010grounding problem (Harnad, 1990) would enable a robot to interpret commands such as \u201cDrive over to receiving and pick up the tire pallet.\u201d This article describes several of our results that use probabilistic inference to address the symbol\u2010grounding problem. Our approach is to develop models that factor according to the linguistic structure of a command. We first describe an early result, a generative model that factors according to the sequential structure of language, and then discuss our new framework, generalized grounding graphs (G 3 ). The G 3 framework dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a natural language input, enabling a mapping between words in language and concrete objects, places, paths, and events in the external world. We report on corpus\u2010based experiments in which the robot is able to learn and use word meanings in three real\u2010world tasks: indoor navigation, spatial language video retrieval, and mobile manipulation.",

      "abstract": "How do numerical symbols, such as number words, acquire semantic meaning? This question, also referred to as the \"symbol-grounding problem,\" is a central problem in the field of numerical cognition. Present theories suggest that symbols acquire their meaning by being mapped onto an approximate system for the nonsymbolic representation of number (Approximate Number System or ANS). In the present literature review, we first asked to which extent current behavioural and neuroimaging data support this theory, and second, to which extent the ANS, upon which symbolic numbers are assumed to be grounded, is numerical in nature. We conclude that (a) current evidence that has examined the association between the ANS and number symbols does not support the notion that number symbols are grounded in the ANS and (b) given the strong correlation between numerosity and continuous variables in nonsymbolic number processing tasks, it is next to impossible to measure the pure association between symbolic and nonsymbolic numerosity. Instead, it is clear that significant cognitive control resources are required to disambiguate numerical from continuous variables during nonsymbolic number processing. Thus, if there exists any mapping between the ANS and symbolic number, then this process of association must be mediated by cognitive control. Taken together, we suggest that studying the role of both cognitive control and continuous variables in numerosity comparison tasks will provide a more complete picture of the symbol-grounding problem.",

Their article is reprinted in Floridi (Citation2011) [as Chapter 7; Chapter 6 is a sustained, stage-setting argument that other approaches fail to solve SGP (and is also derived directly from a journal article, namely Taddeo and Floridi (Citation2005))]. References herein are to the article itself. 2. In terms of the hierarchy of increasingly intelligent artificial agents introduced in Bringsjord, Noel, and Caporale (Citation2000), T&F point the way to synthetic creatures quite dim on the scale. For commentary on a scale specifically for communication, which allows that birds communicate pretty much at the level of the hide-and-feed robots that T&F are impressed by Bringsjord and Bringsjord (Citation1993) (see Section 3). 3. Rather long ago I pointed out that this expectation is folly (Bringsjord, Citation1992). 4. We read:Before defining the symbol grounding problem I will give two examples of it. The first comes from Searle's (Citation1980) celebrated 'Chinese Room Argument,' in which the symbol grounding problem is referred to as the problem of intrinsic meaning (or 'intentionality'): Searle challenges the core assumption of symbolic AI that a symbol system able to generate behavior indistinguishable from that of a person must have a mind. More specifically, according to the symbolic theory of mind, if a computer could pass the Turing Test (Turing, Citation1950) in Chinese \u2013 i.e. if it could respond to all Chinese symbol strings it receives as input with Chinese symbol strings that are indistinguishable from the replies a real Chinese speaker would make (even if we keep testing for a lifetime) \u2013then the computer would understand the meaning of Chinese symbols in the same sense that I understand the meaning of English symbols. (Harnad, Citation1990, p. 337) 5. I have here skipped to the version of CRA designed by Searle to counter the so-called 'Robot Reply' in Searle (Citation1980). My expansion and refinement of CRA in Bringsjord and Noel (Citation2002) is a (confessedly intricate) robot-reply version of the argument. 6. It would be easy enough to modify the example so that Allison's 'recommended' actions were more violent, and hence the consequences of Rob's misunderstanding in turn more severe. 7. We know that even problem-solving easier than that demanded by higher education requires understanding semantic content at the level of first-order logic; this is something e.g. Inhelder and Piaget (Citation1958) showed. Of course, in addition, my parable presupposes at least a quantified epistemic logic, but for purposes of evaluating T&F's proposed solution to SGP, there is nothing to be gained by considering the details of such a logic. Interested readers may wish to see e.g. Bringsjord and Govindarajulu (Citation2012). 8. There is by the way nothing to be gained by searching out the details of . All that is needed for my refutation is that subsumes a garden-variety truth-functional framework, such as the standard model-theoretic semantics of first-order logic. 9. Alert, critical readers will find the 'some fairly advanced' phrase ominously elastic, but I ignore this soon-to-be-the-crux issue for the moment.10. There are clearly some immediate consequences of the affirmation of the Z Condition. First, subscribers to the doctrine of innate semantic capacities are rather left out in the cold. (For what it is worth, this includes me, since I e.g. believe that 'background logic' \u2013treated elegantly and rigorously in Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas (Citation1994) \u2013 and facility with it is innate. For example, I hold that facility for using disjunctive syllogism is innate.) Second, subscribers to the doctrine that high-level semantic capacity at the level of neurobiologically normal human persons was indeed 'injected' into Homo sapiens sapiens by God are in the cold as well. (Hence, Darwin is warm; but the co-discoverer of evolution by mutation and natural selection, Wallace, a theist, is by the Z Condition freezing.) Third, thinkers who hold that 'Fodor's Paradox' (Fodor, Citation2008) for a recent presentation, see e.g. (sometimes called 'the paradox of learning') is not solvable by any move that fails to invoke either innatism or externalism are also automatically cast aside. (By the way, if T&F succeed in solving SGP under the constraint of the Z Condition, they have automatically also solved Fodor's Paradox!)11. Contributions to which have been made by Turing (Citation1950), who proclaimed that by the year 2000 the test that bears his name would be passed by computing machines, and who, in a brave but fideistic call for evolutionary approaches that would presumably resonate with T&F, saw little problem in setting down a machine in Cog-style and having it learn everything that otherwise engineers would painstakingly labour to figure out, and program in.12.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog(project); http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog_(project)13. And note that at worst you might be slightly unsure that Allison's was being sarcastic \u2013 in which case you would still genuinely understand the situation, and would not energetically set out withered flowers.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a lot of studies in the domain of numerical cognition have been published demonstrating a robust association between numerical symbol processing and individual differences in mathematics achievement. Because numerical symbols are so important for mathematics achievement, many researchers want to provide an answer on the 'symbol grounding problem,' i.e., how does a symbol acquires its numerical meaning? The most popular account, the approximate number system (<i>ANS</i>) <i>mapping account</i>, assumes that a symbol acquires its numerical meaning by being mapped on a non-verbal and ANS. Here, we critically evaluate four arguments that are supposed to support this account, i.e., (1) there is an evolutionary system for approximate number processing, (2) non-symbolic and symbolic number processing show the same behavioral effects, (3) non-symbolic and symbolic numbers activate the same brain regions which are also involved in more advanced calculation and (4) non-symbolic comparison is related to the performance on symbolic mathematics achievement tasks. Based on this evaluation, we conclude that all of these arguments and consequently also the mapping account are questionable. Next we explored less popular alternative, where small numerical symbols are initially mapped on a precise representation and then, in combination with increasing knowledge of the counting list result in an independent and exact symbolic system based on order relations between symbols. We evaluate this account by reviewing evidence on order judgment tasks following the same four arguments. Although further research is necessary, the available evidence so far suggests that this <i>symbol-symbol association account</i> should be considered as a worthy alternative of how symbols acquire their meaning.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe symbol grounding problem (SGP), which remains difficult for AI and philosophy of information, was recently scrutinised by Taddeo and Floridi (Solving the symbol grounding problem: A critical review of fifteen years of research. Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence, 17, 419\u2013445, 2005; A praxical solution of the symbol grounding problem. Minds and machines, 17, 369\u2013389, doi:10.1007/s11023-007-9081-32005, 2007). However, their own solution to SGP, underwritten by Action-based Semantics, although different from other solutions, does not seem to be satisfactory. Moreover, it does not satisfy the authors' principle, which they dub 'Zero Semantic Commitment Condition'. In this paper, Taddeo and Floridi's solution is criticised in particular because of the excessively liberal relationship between symbols and internal states of agents, which is conceived in terms of levels of abstraction. Also, the notion of action seems to be seriously defective in their theory. Due to the lack of the possibility of symbols to misrepresent, the grounded symbols remain useless for the cognitive system itself, and it is unclear why they should be grounded in the first place, as the role of grounded symbols is not specified by the proposed solution. At the same time, it is probably one of the best-developed attempts to solve SGP and shows that naturalised semantics can benefit from taking artificial intelligence seriously.Keywords:: symbol grounding problemactioninformational semantics Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by National Science Centre [PRELUDIUM 3 2012/05/N/HS1/02900].",

The initial question about thinking machines is then reformulated into \u201ccan AAs generate meanings like humans do?\u201d We correspondingly present the TT, the CRA and the SGP as being about generation of human-like meanings. We model and address such possibility by using the Meaning Generator System (MGS) where a system submitted to an internal constraint generates a meaning in order to satisfy the constraint. The system approach of the MGS allows comparing meaning generations in animals, humans and AAs. The comparison shows that in order to have AAs capable of generating human-like meanings, we need the AAs to carry human constraints. And transferring human constraints to AAs raises concerns coming from the unknown natures of life and human mind which are at the root of human constraints. Implications for the TT, the CRA and the SGP are highlighted. It is shown that designing AAs capable of thinking like humans needs an understanding about the natures of life and human mind that we do not have today. Following an evolutionary approach, we propose as a first entry point an investigation about the possibility for extending a \u201cstay alive \u201d constraint into AAs. Ethical concerns are raised from the relations between human constraints and human values. Continuations are proposed.",

This analysis initiated a debate and solicited commentaries from experts in the field to gather consensus on progress and achievements and identify the challenges still open in the symbol grounding problem.",

It then defends the zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition), as the requirement to be satisfied by a strategy in order to provide a valid solution of the SGP. Sections 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 analyse eight main solutions of the SGP. None of them respects the Z condition, and hence they all fail to provide a valid solution of the SGP. The chapter ends with a more constructive conclusion, about the requirements that a solution of the SGP should satisfy. This is developed in chapter seven.",

One of the biggest debates in the cognitive sciences concerns the question how human brains are able to do this. Do we need a material explanation or a system explanation? John Searle\u2019s well known Chinese Room thought experiment, which continues to generate a vast polemic literature of arguments and counter-arguments, has argued that autonomously establishing internal representations of the world (called \u2019intentionality\u2019 in philosophical parlance) is based on special properties of human neural tissue and that consequently an artificial system, such as an autonomous physical robot, can never achieve this. Here we study the Grounded Naming Game as a particular example of symbolic interaction and investigate a dynamical system that autonomously builds up and uses the semiotic networks necessary for performance in the game. We demonstrate in real experiments with physical robots that such a dynamical system indeed leads to a successful emergent communication system and hence that symbol grounding and intentionality can be explained in terms of a particular kind of system dynamics. The human brain has obviously the right mechanisms to participate in this kind of dynamics but the same dynamics can also be embodied in other types of physical systems.",

It had been shown to solve Sudoku puzzles visually from examples of puzzle digit images, and was heralded as an impressive achievement towards the longstanding AI goal of combining pattern recognition with logical reasoning. In this paper, we clarify SATNet's capabilities by showing that in the absence of intermediate labels that identify individual Sudoku digit images with their logical representations, SATNet completely fails at visual Sudoku (0% test accuracy). More generally, the failure can be pinpointed to its inability to learn to assign symbols to perceptual phenomena, also known as the symbol grounding problem, which has long been thought to be a prerequisite for intelligent agents to perform real-world logical reasoning. We propose an MNIST based test as an easy instance of the symbol grounding problem that can serve as a sanity check for differentiable symbolic solvers in general. Naive applications of SATNet on this test lead to performance worse than that of models without logical reasoning capabilities. We report on the causes of SATNet's failure and how to prevent them.",

The quantum system identification problem is the problem of relating observational outcomes to specific collections of physical degrees of freedom, i.e., to specific Hilbert spaces. It is shown that with reasonable physical assumptions these problems are equivalent. As the quantum system identification problem is demonstrably unsolvable by finite means, the symbol grounding problem is similarly unsolvable.",

The paper focuses on two essential problems; one is the symbol grounding problem and the other is how the internal symbolic processes can be situated with respect to the behavioral contexts. We investigate these problems by applying a dynamical system's approach to the robot navigation learning problem. Our formulation, based on a forward modeling scheme using recurrent neural learning, shows that the robot is capable of learning grammatical structure hidden in the geometry of the workspace from the local sensory inputs through its navigational experiences. Furthermore, the robot is capable of generating diverse action plans to reach an arbitrary goal using the acquired forward model which incorporates chaotic dynamics. The essential claim is that the internal symbolic process, being embedded in the attractor, is grounded since it is self-organized solely through interaction with the physical world. It is also shown that structural stability arises in the interaction between the neural dynamics and the environmental dynamics, which accounts for the situatedness of the internal symbolic process, The experimental results using a mobile robot, equipped with a local sensor consisting of a laser range finder, verify our claims.",

      "abstract": "Humans use signs, e.g., sentences in a spoken language, for communication and thought. Hence, symbol systems like language are crucial for our communication with other agents and adaptation to our real-world environment. The symbol systems we use in our human society adaptively and dynamically change over time. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive systems, the symbol grounding problem has been regarded as one of the central problems related to symbols. However, the symbol grounding problem was originally posed to connect symbolic AI and sensorimotor information and did not consider many interdisciplinary phenomena in human communication and dynamic symbol systems in our society, which semiotics considered. In this paper, we focus on the symbol emergence problem, addressing not only cognitive dynamics but also the dynamics of symbol systems in society, rather than the symbol grounding problem. We first introduce the notion of a symbol in semiotics from the humanities, to leave the very narrow idea of symbols in symbolic AI. Furthermore, over the years, it became more and more clear that symbol emergence has to be regarded as a multifaceted problem. Therefore, second, we review the history of the symbol emergence problem in different fields, including both biological and artificial systems, showing their mutual relations. We summarize the discussion and provide an integrative viewpoint and comprehensive overview of symbol emergence in cognitive systems. Additionally, we describe the challenges facing the creation of cognitive systems that can be part of symbol emergence systems.",

My own construal has always been simple: Cognition cannot be just computation, because computation is just the systematically interpretable manipulation of meaningless symbols, whereas the meanings of my thoughts don't depend on their interpretability or interpretation by someone else. On pain of infinite regress, then, symbol meanings must be grounded in something other than just their interpretability if they are to be candidates for what is going on in our heads. Neural nets may be one way to ground the names of concrete objects and events in the capacity to categorize them (by learning the invariants in their sensorimotor projections). These grounded elementary symbols could then be combined into symbol strings expressing propositions about more abstract categories. Grounding does not equal meaning, however, and does not solve any philosophical problems.",

Our nets are trained to categorize and name 50 \u00d7 50 pixel images (e.g. circles, ellipses, squares and rectangles) projected on to the receptive field of a 7 \u00d7 7 retina. They first learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming for the four kinds of stimuli, grounding their names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unit representations ('sensorimotor toil'). We show that a higher-level categorization (e.g. 'symmetric' versus 'asymmetric') can be learned in two very different ways: either (1) directly from the input, just as with the entry-level categories (i.e. by toil); or (2) indirectly, from Boolean combinations of the grounded category names in the form of propositions describing the higher-order category ('symbolic theft'). We analyse the architectures and input conditions that allow grounding (in the form of compression/ separation in internal similarity space) to be 'transferred' in this second way from directly grounded entry-level category names to higher-order category names. Such hybrid models have implications for the evolution and learning of language.",

The field appears to be advancing closer to this goal with recent breakthroughs in deep learning for natural language grounding in static images. In this paper, we propose to translate videos directly to sentences using a unified deep neural network with both convolutional and recurrent structure. Described video datasets are scarce, and most existing methods have been applied to toy domains with a small vocabulary of possible words. By transferring knowledge from 1.2M+ images with category labels and 100,000+ images with captions, our method is able to create sentence descriptions of open-domain videos with large vocabularies. We compare our approach with recent work using language generation metrics, subject, verb, and object prediction accuracy, and a human evaluation.",

Our approach involves the following aspects of cognitive vision : knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation, reasoning and machine learning. The symbol grounding problem is considered as a problem as such and we propose an independent cognitive system dedicated to symbol grounding. This symbol grounding system introduces an intermediate layer between the semantic interpretation problem (reasoning in the semantic level) and the image processing problem. An important aspect of the work concerns the use of two ontologies to make easier the communication between the different layers : a visual concept ontology and an image processing ontology. We use two approaches to solve the symbol grounding problem: a machine learning approach and an a priori knowledge based approach.",

We discuss how we can simulate language evolution in a relatively complex environment which has been developed in the context of the New Ties project. This project has the objective of evolving a cultural society and, in doing so, the agents have to evolve a communication system that is grounded in their interactions with their virtual environment and with other individuals. A preliminary experiment is presented in which we investigate the effect of a number of learning mechanisms. The results show that the social symbol grounding problem is a particularly hard one; however, we provide an ideal platform to study this problem.",
