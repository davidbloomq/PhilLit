Moreover, this re-examination of SNLT draws on a novel reading of the textual evidence offered by the critical edition of the manuscripts for Capital, against the backdrop of a brief overview of the controversies between the three main interpretations which can be found in the literature, and the development of an alternative systematic-dialectical presentation of the constitution of the content and concrete forms of realization of the quantitative determination of value.",

      "abstract": "To stimulate learners\u2019 autonomy, autonomy-supportive teaching strategies were included in the design of a multidisciplinary elective course on pain. During this course, students explored pain from different disciplinary angles, i.e., from biomedical, psychological, arts, philosophical, and anthropological perspectives. In the course, autonomy was stimulated by giving students freedom of choice, especially in their final assignments. The aim of this study was to explore students\u2019 freedom of choice and students\u2019 perceptions of the multidisciplinary course on pain, particularly students\u2019 perception of autonomy in the light of self-determination theory (SDT). To address the aim of this study, a mixed methods approach was used. Directed content analysis was conducted on a reflective part of the final individual assignment and was used to find categories fitting within SDT and also outside it. In addition to this, the diversity of topics as well as different disciplines present in the final individual assignments was explored to demonstrate students\u2019 freedom of choice. This study shows that the course setup supported students\u2019 autonomy and relatedness and stimulated students\u2019 interest in and relevance to pain. Moreover, it stimulated students\u2019 freedom of choice and stimulated curiosity towards disciplines such as arts and philosophy. Therefore, it can be concluded that we successfully developed a multidisciplinary course on pain in which students are exposed to different autonomy-supportive teaching strategies based on the SDT framework.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes a semantic theory proposed by the main representatives of the Brentano School and clarifies the characteristic features of the Brentanist philosophy of language. The first section identifies the specificity of Brentano\u2019s functional approach to language, and separately examines how Brentano de\u00adfined the communicative meaning of expressions. The second section reproduces the scheme in accordance with which A. Marty studied language communica\u00adtion, and also discusses in detail his method of descriptive analysis of meanings. On the example of the doctrine of the inner linguistic form, it is shown what in\u00adfluence descriptive psychology had on semantic research. On the example of the doctrine of the judgmental content it is demonstrated how Marty explained the representative properties of expressions. In the third section, A. Meinong\u2019s semantic theory is reconstructed. It is discussed how Meinong interpreted the se\u00admiotics of E. Martinak and how he approached the issue of defining the concept of meaning. The problem of the unity of sentences is particularly analyzed and Meinong\u2019s solution is reproduced. It is shown what changes Meinong made to the theory of meaning, and what influence the theory of incomplete objects had on his semantic doctrine. The interpretation and evaluation of Meinong\u2019s late semantic theory is proposed. Finally, in the fourth section, E. Husserl\u2019s the\u00adory of meaning is analyzed. It is shown that Husserl distinguished several senses of the concept of meaning and considered the main sense to be the one that al\u00adlows identifying the concept of meaning with the concept of content. The clarifi\u00adcations made by Husserl to the thesis of the ideality of meanings are discussed. It is demonstrated that the new concept of meaning analysis associated with the clarified thesis makes it possible to evaluate Husserl's semantic theory as more universal than Meinong\u2019s theory.",

      "abstract": "The theory of \"alienated labor\" is a crucial component of Marx's \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\". It also provides strong support for analyzing the poverty of workers under the capitalist mode of production. Marx made extensive discussions on \"alienated labor\", constructed a relatively complete conceptual system, and systematically analyzed the fourfold determination of alienated labor as the primary content. On the basis of analyzing the fourfold determination, exploring the hidden relationship between alienated labor and private property, and seeking practical ways to eliminate alienated labor are the key to truly grasping Marx's theory of alienated labor. This theory is not only a major theoretical achievement of Marx's criticism of bourgeois political economy, but also an important breakthrough for the formation of his historical materialism. It can be said that the issue of alienation plays a connecting role in Marxism, especially in Marxist political economy. Considering the current development of China's economy and society in the context of the new era, the new development concept implemented in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics embodies the practical significance and guiding value of Marx's theory of alienated labor: promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for man and nature through innovative development and green development; advancing the building of harmonious labor relations through shared development and open development; and facilitating the free and all-round development of human beings through coordinated development.",

In this paper, I critically assess the hybrid theory\u2019s answers to both challenges, arguing that their hybrid nature undermines their merits. In each case, I will show that it is hard to establish how the alleged complementariness of the hybrid account components works. I will conclude that internal problems beset Shea\u2019s theory of representation.",

      "abstract": "\n Confucian ideas are deeply rooted in Chinese traditional culture, having played a crucial role in the formation and development of China's traditional musical art. This research focuses on the historical evolution and modern transformation of Confucian musical thought, systematically analyzing the philosophical content, social functions and practical value of its theoretical system in the context of various historical eras. The work is developing in three key areas: The first part is devoted to the theoretical system of ancient Confucian music, examining how ancient Confucianism integrated music into the cosmological paradigm of the \"unity of Heaven and man\", forming an ethical and pedagogical system based on the triadic system of interaction \"sound - emotion \u2014 virtue\"; the second part is devoted to the Philosophy of Confucian music in the era of modernization, An analysis of the theoretical reconstruction of Confucian musical philosophy in the context of the modernization turn of the New Age, where the traditional \"ritual-musical system\" (\u793c\u4e50\u5236\u5ea6) was transformed under the influence of Western rationalism and technocratic civilization into the \"aesthetics of spiritual nature\"; the third part is devoted to practical value in modern society, the study of ways of creative transformation Confucian music theory in the context of globalization and digital technologies through the prism of cultural management, educational practices and environmental ethics. The present study overcomes the one-dimensional historical and philosophical narrativization, revealing the immanent logic of \"variability-immutability\" of Confucian music theory through a triad of methodological perspectives: philosophical ontology, political sociology and cultural praxeology. These conclusions form the theoretical basis for the reinterpretation of traditional cultural resources in the context of modernity, while simultaneously offering epistemological guidelines for the rehabilitation of the humanistic dimension in the era of technological determination.\n",

That fitness can be exploited in constructing an externalist theory of reference determination for these terms. The resulting externalist theory draws support from standard responses to Moral Twin-Earth scenarios. The relevance of these responses to moral semantics has recently been vigorously challenged by Dowell and by Schroeter and Schroeter. The social character of meaning relations, which can explain the openness of questions about an analysis, may thereby also make Twin-Earth judgements beside the point. But the resources available to translators go beyond semantic competence and it is these resources that nonetheless make the Moral Twin-Earth responses relevant.",

However, this approach is threatened by worries that the S-representation account cannot tell a satisfactory story about content determination at the subpersonal level. One solution is to complement the S-representation account with a traditional etiological theory of content determination. This paper argues such a move is unwarranted and threatens the broader project of understanding representation in mechanism-friendly terms. Once properly situated within a mechanistic framework, the S-representation account can address the issue of content determination without supplementing it with an etiological theory. In turn, this strengthens the notion that combing a mechanistic framework with the S-representation account provides a robust and comprehensive defense of representation\u2019s positive role in cognitive science.",

This paper offers conceptual role expressivists a way to close this gap, by fleshing out the idea that concepts have the relevant sorts of contents just in case and because they could otherwise not play their distinctive function.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Coordination is the presumption that distinct representations have the same referential content. Philosophers have discussed ways in which the presence of coordination might bear on the metasemantic determination of content. One test case for exploring the relationship between coordination and content is the phenomenon of conflation\u2014the situation in which representations are about distinct things but are nevertheless coordinated. In this paper, I use observations about conflation to develop an anaphoric metasemantics for some representations in which coordination plays an integral role. I also develop some novel remarks on the problem of misrepresentation.",

      "abstract": "The paper analyzes main logical categories in Hegel\u2019s Logic from the standpoint of contemporary formal logic and analytic philosophy of language. Hegel is taken as a radical critical philosopher in Kantian sense, who develops Kantian critical philosophy. Hegel\u2019s Logic is portrayed as metaphysics and semantics, for it provides a profound analysis of logical form of main categories and the logical structure of local speech domains. The author considers subjectivity of judgements, constitution of sortal domains and an inferentialist account of predicates within logical universe of discourse. Speech acts are always singular acts that are performed and articulated by speakers. The content of a judgement is constituted due to the intricate genus-species difference system, which is expressed by the concepts of infinite negation and determinate negation. Some speech acts require knowledge not only of generic properties that are inherent to genus of a subject matter, but also contentful determination of difference of the particular individuals in question. Sense of predicates is determined within an inferential system of sentences and their relations of inference and contradiction. The form of inference is defined solely syntactically or logically, however for any particular case is required contentful knowledge, which is based on pre-knowledge and power of judgement. The system of science is a network of material- conceptual truths taken as synthetic judgements a priori. Hegelian concept of \u201cidea\u201d signifies adequate theoretical and shared practical forms that include the ways of evaluation of generic judgements as correct or true ones, which should serve to our orientation in the world. Hence the idea is essentially the same as the personal form of human life.",

      "abstract": "The right to informational self-determination, as the authority of the individual to decide fundamentally for herself, when and within what limits personal data may be disclosed, was formulated by German jurisprudence and has become a model for many States as well as for European Law in general. It is seen as a necessary tool for maintaining a vibrant democracy, on the basis that privacy is an \u201cintegral part\u201d of society. The basis for the judicial decision was the Kantian theory of the moral autonomy of the individual. This explains the close connection of judicial reasoning with human rights and their Public Law protection. At the same time, under Anglo-Saxon influence, a \u201cproperty approach\u201d to personal data which may become the object of transactions is developing. The \u201cproperty approach\u201d views personal data as a valuable commodity that can be the object of transactions and operations with other people through licenses. In practice, access to personal data has recently been increasingly provided as a counter performance (compensation) to contracts for the provision of digital content and in exchange for personalized services. The study shows there are many interactions of public and private in the legal protection of data (information self-determination as a subjective public right requires the corresponding obligations of the State to be formalized, there is no unambiguous sector qualification of a person\u2019s consent to data processing, the insufficiency of the principle of confidentiality by default before the potential for harm is noted). Analysis of the evolution of the data legal protection leads to conclude that the public/private distinction is gradually levelling off. It seems that the problem of the circulation and protection of personal data cannot be solved in a sector framework, but only comprehensively, without violating the traditional logic of public and private. This means that the right to information self-determination, due to its complex nature, can be regarded as a principle that has an inter-branch nature extends to both the Public Law data protection and the implementation of subjective civil rights in this area.",

Religious experience provides the necessary grounds for developing a theory of the world as a single\nwhole. The \u201cuniversal\u201d idea, which unites the theoretical and practical, as well as the aesthetic content of the concept, is, first of all,\nthe idea of Christian love. Any social (\u201corganic\u201d) function acts normally and abnormally, allowing abuses and generating injustice.\nThe Christian worldview, self-determination of the individual \u2014 the realisation of a specific moral ideal, free spiritual creativity allow\nto resist the \u201cphilosophical poverty\u201d of industrial culture and \u201ccollective impersonality\u201d.",
