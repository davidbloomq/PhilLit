Another dimension is recognized as generalization, the possibility to go over from specific to more general types of problems. A third dimension is semantic grounding.",

A computer program is a semantically interpretable formal symbol system consisting of rules for manipulating symbols on the basis of their shapes, which are arbitrary in relation to what they can be systematically interpreted as meaning.",
