      "abstract": "Within contemporary philosophy of mind, it is taken for granted that externalist accounts of meaning and mental content are, in principle, orthogonal to the matter of whether cognition itself is bound within the biological brain or whether it can constitutively include parts of the world. Accordingly, Clark and Chalmers (Analysis 58(1):7\u201319, 1998) distinguish these varieties of externalism as \u2018passive\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 respectively. The aim here is to suggest that we should resist the received way of thinking about these dividing lines. With reference to Brandom\u2019s (1994, 2000, Inquiry 47:236\u2013253, 2008) broad semantic inferentialism, we show that a theory of meaning can be at the same time a variety of active externalism. While we grant that supporters of other varieties of content externalism (e.g., Putnam 1975 and Burge (Philosophical Review 95:3\u201345, 1986) can deny active externalism, this is not an option for semantic inferentialists: On this latter view, the role of the environment (both in its social and natural form) is not \u2018passive\u2019 in the sense assumed by the alternative approaches to content externalism.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The paper presents teleo-inferentialism, which is a novel meta-semantic theory that combines advantages of teleosemantics and normative inferentialism. Like normative inferentialism, teleo-inferentialism holds that contents are individuated by the norms that govern inferences in which they occur. This allows teleo-inferentialism to account for sophisticated concepts. Like teleosemantics, teleo-inferentialism explains conceptual norms in a naturalistically acceptable way by appeal to the broadly biological well-functioning of our innate capacities. As a test-case for teleo-inferentialism, I discuss how the view handles Kripkenstein-style meaning skepticism.",

Critics of inferentialism often argue that it violates the principle of compositionality, and that it is therefore unable to explain some important linguistic data. I have two tasks in this paper: the first is to demonstrate that inferentialism, appearances perhaps to the contrary, does not violate the principle of compositionality, and the second is to explain why this demonstration is unlikely to mollify critics of inferentialism. The dispute between inferentialists and their critics, I shall argue, is not about compositionality, it is a more fundamental dispute about the nature of representations.",

We analyzed an intern\u2019s research project in a hospital laboratory in which reducing uncertainties was crucial to make a valid statistical inference. In his project, the intern, Sam, investigated whether patients\u2019 blood could be sent through pneumatic post without influencing the measurement of particular blood components. We asked, in the process of making a statistical inference, how are reasons and actions coordinated to reduce uncertainty? For the analysis, we used the semantic theory of inferentialism, specifically, the concept of webs of reasons and actions\u2014complexes of interconnected reasons for facts and actions; these reasons include premises and conclusions, inferential relations, implications, motives for action, and utility of tools for specific purposes in a particular context. Analysis of interviews with Sam, his supervisor and teacher as well as video data of Sam in the classroom showed that many of Sam\u2019s actions aimed to reduce variability, rule out errors, and thus reduce uncertainties so as to arrive at a valid inference. Interestingly, the decisive factor was not the outcome of a t test but of the reference change value, a clinical chemical measure of analytic and biological variability. With insights from this case study, we expect that students can be better supported in connecting statistics with context and in dealing with uncertainty.",

This aim is pursued by comparison of semantic inferentialism with another two popular semantic approaches to moral discourse, namely representational and expressivist approaches. While the rep-resentationalism claims that statements gain their meanings by representing cer-tain states of affairs, the expressivist semantics claims that the meanings of moral statements consist in the emotions or desires we express by them. Thesis of this paper is that semantic inferentialism is a promising semantic theory of moral discourse because it allows us to take the position that moral statements are meaningful without assuming the existence of controversial entities in the form of objective ethical facts, and at the same time, it does not require us to interpret moral discourse merely as a means for expressing our emotions and desires.",

Using the philosophical theory of inferentialism, we trace an epistemological dimension of multilingualism in mathematics education and add it to the current language-as-resource discussions. With data from two different settings\u2014a mathematics classroom in Sweden and a workshop in an indigenous settlement in Colombia\u2014we show that in encounters between language practices and plural mathematics, the semantic and the epistemological are two sides of the same coin. Inferentialism captures such encounters without dichotomising either languages or mathematics. We contend that epistemological issues move beyond the scope of language-as-resource approaches, but they are not paths to improving school achievement. Neither are they matters of distinguishing between formal and informal language use. Rather, an epistemological dimension is about shaping meta-understandings of language diversity that are liberated from mathematics as fixed and pre-stablished knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Metasemantic inferentialism has gained popularity in the last few decades. Traditionally, inferentialism is combined with a deflationary attitude towards semantic terms such as truth and reference, i.e., many inferentialists hold that when we use these semantic terms we do not purport to refer to substantive properties. This combination makes inferentialism attractive for philosophers who see themselves as antirealists. Although the attractions of combining inferentialism and deflationism are easy to see, deflationism is also a controversial position. For one, deflationists maintain that truth is an insubstantive property, but it is not altogether clear what an insubstantive property is. Secondly, as deflationists maintain that truth does not play an explanatory role, it is incompatible with the position that truth can explain the normativity of truth talk. Given that deflationism faces these objections, it would be preferable if the success of inferentialism did not depend on the deflationist\u2019s ability to respond to these objections. I argue that someone attracted to inferentialism for its ability to accommodate antirealist intuitions about a domain (e.g. morality) is not committed to deflationism about truth. More specifically, I will show that inferentialism combined with a straightforward account of inferentialist truth-conditions is compatible with a version of truth pluralism. I call this position Inferentialist Truth Pluralism.",

More particularly, it is demonstrated that unrestricted logical inferentialism is a version of logical conventionalism by arguing for conventionalism in detail and answering various objections involving the role of metasemantic principles and semantic completeness in the conventionalist argument. The chapter then discusses how this account relates to the deflationist accounts offered by Field and others, before turning to the metaphysics and normativity of logic, which it discusses on conventionalist grounds. Overall, this chapter shows that conventionalism leads to a naturalistically acceptable and philosophically plausible theory of logic.",

Tending a bridge from the Kantian theory of judgements to Dewey\u2019s pragmatic philosophy, with the Fregean notion of conceptual content providing the pillars, and relying on the teachings drawn from the later Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy as keystones, I begin by questioning the dominant view of representationalism in analytical philosophy after Russell, Carnap and Tarski. It is here that I begin weaving the conceptual network that will eventually blossom into the program of pragmatic rationalism with logical inferentialism and semantic expressivism as pivotal notions, manifest in our game of asking for and giving reasons. It is for these reasons that I agree that a bilingual version of this early piece seems a good starting point for the reflections on what unites and what divides la philosophical visions of Wittgenstein and my own.",

We analyzed an intern\u2019s research project in a hospital laboratory in which reducing uncertainties was crucial to make a valid statistical inference. In his project, the intern, Sam, investigated whether patients\u2019 blood could be sent through pneumatic post without influencing the measurement of particular blood components. We asked, in the process of making a statistical inference, how are reasons and actions coordinated to reduce uncertainty? For the analysis, we used the semantic theory of inferentialism, specifically, the concept of webs of reasons and actions\u2014complexes of interconnected reasons for facts and actions; these reasons include premises and conclusions, inferential relations, implications, motives for action, and utility of tools for specific purposes in a particular context. Analysis of interviews with Sam, his supervisor and teacher as well as video data of Sam in the classroom showed that many of Sam\u2019s actions aimed to reduce variability, rule out errors, and thus reduce uncertainties so as to arrive at a valid inference. Interestingly, the decisive factor was not the outcome of a t test but of the reference change value, a clinical chemical measure of analytic and biological variability. With insights from this case study, we expect that students can be better supported in connecting statistics with context and in dealing with uncertainty.",

Little attention has been given to her semantic theory or philosophy of language. This essay demonstrates the difficulties and problems that arise from this theory, problems that could be avoided with a sociopractical account of language and exemplarity. One set of problems pertain to the \u201cprinciple of the division of linguistic labor.\u201d Related problems come to light in Zagzebski's attempt to account for radical changes in perceptions of exemplars through social, political, and ethical revolutions. In the end, her semantic theory creates the very epistemological uncertainties that it is meant to forestall. It also fails to account for radical disagreements about exemplars and the role moral exemplars play in sociopolitical and ethical revolutions.",

Musical elements cannot be fully understood without considering the surrounding aspects, which lie outside the music itself. This dual nature also applies to church music. However, music used in and for worship is also a performance. This research examines the presence of these two characteristics in musical performances during Christian worship. Through Marco DeMarinis' semiotic theory, these two characteristics are manifested in the relationship between text, co-text, and context. The study's findings demonstrate that musical elements are no more important than extra-musical elements because in Christian worship, the Word is the ultimate objective of a liturgy: Without music, Christian worship can still occur, but without the Word, worship cannot be conducted.",

Is a semantic theory of ordinary language possible? What form should this theory take? Is it possible to revive Gottlob Frege\u2019s semantics in modern analytic philosophy? Can Jerrold Katz\u2019s linguistic Platonism claim the status of a semantic theory of ordinary language? Is the concept \u201cmeaning as use\u201d of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein a semantic theory? The participants of the discussion tried to answer these questions. The author of this article gives a brief summary of the positions presented in the discussion and draws general conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Semanticists often restrict their theories by imposing constraints on the parameters that can be employed for interpreting the expressions of a language. Such constraints are based on non-logical features of actual contexts of utterance, but they often have important effects on issues that do pertain to logic, like analyticity or entailment. For example, Kaplan\u2019s restriction to so-called \u201cproper contexts\u201d was required in order to count \u201cI am here now\u201d as valid. In this paper I argue that constraints of this kind are often posited in an arbitrary and non-consistent way, and that they yield the intended results only at the price of imposing ad hoc principles whose justification could in turn justify further, often undesirable restrictions into the theory. I also introduce a criterion for telling whether such constraints are imposed in a legitimate manner.",

      "abstract": "First-Order Logic (FOL), also called first-order predicate calculus, is a formal language that provides a framework to comprehensively represent a world and its present state, including all of its entities, attributes, and complex interrelations, irrespective of their physical modality (e.g., text, image, or sensor data). Grounded in this universal representation, this paper develops a mathematical theory for semantic information and communication tailored to tasks involving logical reasoning and inference. For semantic communication, our framework distinguishes between two fundamental components: the physical cost of transmitting symbols of the FOL language and the logical content those symbols represent. A calibrated measure for semantic content is proposed, which allows for the consistent comparison of information value across different logical systems. This measure quantifies the degree to which a message reduces uncertainty about the true state of the world. Building on this measure, semantic entropy, conditional and mutual information metrics are defined. These metrics are then used to formulate optimizable objectives for semantic communication, designed to preserve the information most relevant for logical reasoning task at the receiver while adhering to a transmission budget. The framework's operational value is demonstrated through experiments in semantic compression, where the proposed objectives are used to manage the trade-off between transmission cost and the preservation of logical content; and deductive inference, where increasing world-state awareness improves deduction performance.",
