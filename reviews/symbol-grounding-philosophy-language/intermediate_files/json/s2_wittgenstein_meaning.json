But I disagree that the only important contribution that grounding and locating scholarly concepts can make is to reactivate histories of contestation and make us aware that our scholarly notions do not drop intact from some rationalist heaven. Even if some of us need to be reminded of that from time to time, I very much doubt that pointing to past and ongoing social contestation about the meaning of a concept is going to do the trick. In my view, reflexive critique of our own scholarly concepts should start by clarifying how we as social scientists are supposed to use concepts\u2014and that in turn comes from (to invoke Wittgenstein again) an investigation of our own \u201cform of life\u201d intended not to explain outcomes, but to normatively prescribe ways of appropriately \u201cgoing on.\u201d If we did that, in my view, we would be in much better shape to contribute to ongoing conversations in a complex and turbulent world.",

To overcome this problem, I put forth a \u201cpraxeological foundationalist\u201d suggestion that may enable one to reconcile Chisholmian foundationalism with Wittgenstein\u2019s constraint that knowledge requires the possibility of error, in a Hallerian spirit, drawing on Wittgenstein\u2019s last views on certainty and self-knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to provide an exegetical analysis of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language as presented in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations. While the traditional interpretation assumes a strict division between an \"early\" and a \"late\" Wittgenstein, this paper critically examines this distinction. Through textual analysis of selected fragments, it is argued that there is no radical discontinuity, but rather a continuity of thought: (1) certain elements of the Tractatus may be read as anticipations of later views, while (2) parts of the Philosophical Investigations can be understood as supplements or modifications of earlier doctrines. Special attention is given to Wittgenstein's notions of \"picture,\" \"proposition,\" and \"paradigm,\" which reveal significant conceptual overlaps across the two works. Moreover, the discussion of emotions-such as the attribution of pain-illustrates the strongest point of convergence. In both works, meaning is grounded in external, observable manifestations: in the Tractatus, the correlation between picture, proposition, and state of affairs, and in the Investigations, the agreement established through shared criteria of use. The results of this analysis indicate that Wittgenstein's philosophy of language develops along a line of inquiry rather than being split into two incompatible phases. One of the main implications is the need to reconsider the standard framework of interpretation: instead of a narrative of existing gap, Wittgenstein's work may be approached as a unified investigation into the attribution of meaning within language.",

      "abstract": "\n Inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy, this book develops a new, non-reductionist, response to the sceptical argument about meaning famously developed in Saul Kripke\u2019s book Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. It begins by outlining an intuitive notion of following a rule, explaining its relationship to the notions of linguistic meaning and intentional content. It then gives an outline and development of Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein\u2019s sceptical argument, going into detail on the arguments against reductive dispositional accounts of meaning. It also explains Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein\u2019s objections to non-reductionist views which take semantic and intentional facts to be primitive and sui generis and argues against views \u2013 such as error theories and forms of non-factualism \u2013 which attempt to respond to the argument by conceding that there are no meaning facts. The position advocated in the book emerges from a response to recent arguments developed by Paul Boghossian (\u201cThe Inference Problem\u201d) and Crispin Wright (\u201cThe Minor Premise Problem\u201d) which appear to imply that rule-following and competent language use are impossible even if we assume that Kripke\u2019s challenge has been met. A reply to Boghossian and Wright is then developed via a new account of Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks on the notion of \u201cfollowing a rule blindly\u201d or \u201cblind rule-following\u201d that connects it to the Wittgensteinian idea that there is a way of following a rule that does not involve interpretation. In turn, this is used to generate a response to Kripke: understanding an expression is a matter of having an intention to exercise one\u2019s ability to use it in accord with its meaning or correctness condition.",

My answer is that the notion of \u2018experience of meaning\u2019 does not bring back some form of psychologism, but rather it develops, integrates and specifies that of \u2018use\u2019.",

And they think that the idea that using a word involves following rules is not just wrong as an interpretation of Wittgenstein; it is philosophically unacceptable in its own right.\u00a0 The paper defends the standard interpretation of Wittgenstein on rules and meaning against Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\u2019s arguments.\u00a0Textual evidence in favour of the standard interpretation is presented.\u00a0 Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\u2019s textual case for their interpretation is discussed and found unconvincing.\u00a0The paper then defends the view that using language involves following rules against Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\u2019s philosophical critique.\u00a0It is argued that Wittgenstein shows us a way to understand language-use as a form of rule-following behaviour that is consistent with his other commitments and maintains the distinction between following a rule and merely acting in accord with a rule.\u00a0His account is an anti-reductionist one; there is no prospect of giving a non-circular account of what it is to follow a rule.\u00a0But there is nothing philosophically unsatisfactory about that.",

      "abstract": "Since the publication of Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language by Saul Kripke, there have been controversial interpretations of what it means by \u2018rule following\u2019 with regard to the question of meaning. Kripke maintains that Wittgenstein\u2019s paradox of rule following demands us to consider what mental or behavioral items could constitute meaning. This boils down, according to Kripke, to the conclusion that either of the choice ends up with a dilemma which calls for a solution yet again to yield another sceptical solution. Rivals to Kripke like McDowell and Wright have argued that if we seriously read Wittgenstein we realise that a dispositional choice is plausible. Others like Patrizio Lo Presti, for example, have defended Wittgenstein by positing that there is no need to separate mental and behvioral items in the first place and that Wittgenstein is misinterpreted. Following this line of thinking, this paper contends that rule following is an essential criteria for Wittgenstein theory of meaning as use. It takes the view that if the paradox forces us to make a choice then it is plausible to choose behavioral items as satisfying rule following and so meaning. The paper thus adopts the position that, when discussing the concept of language game to the conclusion that the meaning of a word is but its use, Wittgenstein successfully uses the concept of rule following to reach this conclusion. Simply, meaning as use is realized when people follow the rules of language. They are neither written rules nor syntactical rules but semantic rules of language based on context. Thus, in our daily conversations and practical life humans tend to follow rules, sometimes without being familiar with that, to successfully understand each other and take actions on various issues at hand. This begins right from the moment we learn language.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the issue of meaning in Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy as it is noticeable in both the early and later Wittgensteins. In the early Wittgenstein expressed in the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, the researchers observed a position influenced by the logically positivist ideology, whereby propositions are meaningful only if they picture states of affairs and with this the insistence on a logically perfect language was made. The implication being that some languages are considered nonsense and unfit for philosophical engagement. However, in his Philosophical Investigations, which is regarded as the later Wittgenstein, a new approach to discovering the constitutive embodiment of meaning became noticeable. Here, Wittgenstein observes that the meaning of a term, phrase or sentence drives from the context of use and thus recognizes the legitimacy of different forms of life. Thus, the \u201cuse\u201d of a language is a game played according to rules that can be understood by the language community or individual users of the language. For the purpose of achieving the aim and objectives of this paper, the hermeneutic, analytical and critical methods of inquiry were employed. The paper argues that since meaning must be sought within the context of use in accordance with the rules that can be understood by the language community or individual users of the language, it is a win for African languages as they are scientifically equipped with their appurtenances for valid philosophical engagement.",

While many attacked Searle\u2019s Chinese Room thought experiment, no one seemed to question this most basic assumption. For how can computers learn something that is not in the data? Emily Bender and Alexander Koller ( 2020 ) recently presented a related thought experiment\u2014the so-called Octopus thought experiment, which replaces the rule-based interlocutor of Searle\u2019s thought experiment with a neural language model. The Octopus thought experiment was awarded a best paper prize and was widely debated in the AI community. Again, however, even its fiercest opponents accepted the premise that what a word refers to cannot be induced in the absence of direct supervision. I will argue that what a word refers to is \u00a0probably learnable from raw text alone. Here\u2019s why: higher-order concept co-occurrence statistics are stable across languages and across modalities, because language use (universally) reflects the world we live in (which is relatively stable). Such statistics are sufficient to establish what words refer to. My conjecture is supported by a literature survey, a thought experiment, and an actual experiment.",

      "abstract": "The article draws parallels between the linguistic theories of Ludwig Wittgen\u00adstein and Walter Benjamin\u2019s ideas about the origin of language and its transfor\u00admations in our world today. Wittgenstein shows in the \u201cTractatus Logico-Phi\u00adlosophicus\u201d the world as a whole, which is ordered in accordance with the grammatical structures of language. At the same time, it allows him to draw a certain border, beyond which is the \u201cinexpressible\u201d, namely, the sphere of ethi\u00adcal values inaccessible to language. Benjamin\u2019s approach to understanding lan\u00adguage, on the contrary, seems completely illogical and irrational. The initial im\u00adpulse here is the biblical myth of the creation of the world by the Word and the idea of language as a God-given gift to human. In the course of historical de\u00advelopment, the power of language is gradually running out and moves further away from its sacred source. However, even in current language practices, it is still possible to recognize this prototype, which is present in speech in the form of the inexpressible. The religious connotations of the \u201cinexpressible\u201d don\u2019t pre\u00advent Benjamin from associating it with the same area of moral reference that Wittgenstein characterized with the term \u201cmystical\u201d. The comparative analysis of the theories of Benjamin and Wittgenstein demonstrates that behind the dif\u00adferent strategies of philosophical understanding there is a common intention to catch the sphere of ethics that escapes direct expression. During the recon\u00adstruction of the teachings of two iconic figures of Western thought, important points of intersection are revealed: the tendency to ontologize language, the in\u00adability to express value meanings in normative statements, the incorporation of an ethical dimension into everyday practices of speech.",
