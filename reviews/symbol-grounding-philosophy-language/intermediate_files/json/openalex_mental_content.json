      "abstract": "Aim Internet gaming disorder ( IGD ) is a serious disorder leading to and maintaining pertinent personal and social impairment. IGD has to be considered in view of heterogeneous and incomplete concepts. We therefore reviewed the scientific literature on IGD to provide an overview focusing on definitions, symptoms, prevalence, and aetiology. Method We systematically reviewed the databases ERIC , Psy ARTICLES , Psyc INFO , PSYNDEX , and PubMed for the period January 1991 to August 2016, and additionally identified secondary references. Results The proposed definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition provides a good starting point for diagnosing IGD but entails some disadvantages. Developing IGD requires several interacting internal factors such as deficient self, mood and reward regulation, problems of decision\u2010making, and external factors such as deficient family background and social skills. In addition, specific game\u2010related factors may promote IGD . Summarizing aetiological knowledge, we suggest an integrated model of IGD elucidating the interplay of internal and external factors. Interpretation So far, the concept of IGD and the pathways leading to it are not entirely clear. In particular, long\u2010term follow\u2010up studies are missing. IGD should be understood as an endangering disorder with a complex psychosocial background. What this paper adds In representative samples of children and adolescents, on average, 2% are affected by Internet gaming disorder (IGD). The mean prevalences (overall, clinical samples included) reach 5.5%. Definitions are heterogeneous and the relationship with substance\u2010related addictions is inconsistent. Many aetiological factors are related to the development and maintenance of IGD. This review presents an integrated model of IGD, delineating the interplay of these factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett's (1987) notion of real patterns , and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops. This suggests that neither psychological nor biological levels can claim causal or explanatory priority, and that a holistic research strategy is necessary for progress in the study of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "The waking mind is often occupied with mental contents that are minimally constrained by events in the here and now. These self-generated thoughts-e.g., mind-wandering or daydreaming-interfere with external task performance and can be a marker for unhappiness and even psychiatric problems. They also occupy our thoughts for upwards of half of the time, and under non-demanding conditions they (i) allow us to connect our past and future selves together, (ii) help us make successful long-term plans and (iii) can provide a source of creative inspiration. The lengths that the mind goes to self-generate thought, coupled with its apparent functionality, suggest that the mind places a higher priority on such cognition than on many other mental acts. Although mind-wandering may be unpleasant for the individual who experiences it and disruptive to the tasks of the moment, self-generated thought allows consciousness freedom from the here and now and so reflects a key evolutionary adaptation for the mind. Here we synthesize recent literature from cognitive and clinical psychology and propose two formal hypotheses that (1) highlight task context and thought content as critical factors that constrain the costs and benefits of self-generated thought and (2) provide direction on ways to investigate the costs and benefits from an impartial perspective.",

      "abstract": "A few empirically supported principles can account for much of the thematic content of waking thought, including rumination, and dreams. (1) An individual's commitments to particular goals sensitize the individual to respond to cues associated with those goals. The cues may be external or internal in the person's own mental activity. The responses may take the form of noticing the cues, storing them in memory, having thoughts or dream segments related to them, and/or taking action. Noticing may be conscious or not. Goals may be any desired endpoint of a behavioral sequence, including finding out more about something, i.e., exploring possible goals, such as job possibilities or personal relationships. (2) Such responses are accompanied and perhaps preceded by protoemotional activity or full emotional arousal, the amplitude of which determines the likelihood of response and is related to the value placed on the goal. (3) When the individual is in a situation conducive to making progress toward attaining the goal, the response to goal cues takes the form of actions or operant mental acts that advance the goal pursuit. (4) When circumstances are unfavorable for goal-directed operant behavior, the response remains purely mental, as in mind-wandering and dreaming, but still reflects the content of the goal pursuit or associated content. (5) Respondent responses such as mind-wandering are more likely when the individual is mentally unoccupied with ongoing tasks and less likely the more that is at stake in the ongoing task. The probability of respondent thought is highest during relaxed periods, when the brain's default-mode network dominates, or during sleep. The article briefly summarizes neurocognitive findings that relate to mind-wandering and evidence regarding adverse effects of mind-wandering on task performance as well as evidence suggesting adaptive functions in regard to creative problem-solving, planning, resisting delay discounting, and memory consolidation.",

Mental models are actors\u2019 assumptions and beliefs that guide their behavior and interpretation of their environment. Design/methodology/approach This paper offers a conceptual framework for innovation in service ecosystems through service design that connects the macro view of innovation as changing institutional arrangements with the micro view of innovation as reshaping actors\u2019 mental models. Furthermore, through an 18-month ethnographic study of service design practices in the context of healthcare, how service design practices reshape mental models to enable innovation is investigated. Findings This research highlights that service design reshapes mental models through the practices of sensing surprise, perceiving multiples and embodying alternatives. This paper delineates the enabling conditions for these practices to occur, such as coaching, diverse participation and supportive physical materials. Research limitations/implications This study brings forward the underappreciated role of actors\u2019 mental models in innovation. It highlights that innovation in service ecosystems is not simply about actors making changes to their external context but also actors shifting their own assumptions and beliefs. Practical implications This paper offers insights for service managers and service designers interested in supporting innovation on how to catalyze shifts in actors\u2019 mental models by creating the conditions for specific service design practices. Originality/value This paper is the first to shed light on the central role of actors\u2019 mental models in innovation and identify the service design practices that reshape mental models.",

      "abstract": "Objectives To create a risk prediction rule for delirium in elderly adults in the emergency department ( ED ) and to compare mortality and resource use of elderly adults in the ED with and without delirium. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Urban tertiary care ED . Participants Individuals aged 65 and older presenting for ED care ( N = 700). Measurements A trained research assistant performed a structured mental status assessment and attention tests, after which delirium was determined using the C onfusion A ssessment M ethod. Data were collected on participant demographics, comorbidities, medications, ED course, hospital and intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission, length of stay, hospital charges, 30\u2010day rehospitalization, and mortality. Results Nine percent of elderly study participants had delirium. Using logistic regression, a delirium prediction rule consisting of older age, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, dementia, suspected infection, and acute intracranial hemorrhage was created had good predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.77). Admitted participants with ED delirium had longer median lengths of stay (4 vs 2 days) and were more likely to require ICU admission (13% vs 6%) and to be discharged to a new long\u2010term care facility (37% vs 9%) than those without. In all participants, ED delirium was associated with higher 30\u2010day mortality (6% vs 1%) and 30\u2010day readmission (27% vs 13%). Conclusion This risk prediction rule may help identify a group of individuals in the ED at high risk of developing delirium who should undergo screening, but it requires external validation. Identification of delirium in the ED may enable physicians to implement strategies to decrease delirium duration and avoid inappropriate discharge of individuals with acute delirium, improving outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Postal and telephone survey research is threatened by declining response rates and high cost. Online recruitment is becoming more popular, although there is little empirical evidence about its cost\u2010effectiveness or the representativeness of online samples. There is also limited research on optimal strategies for developing advertising content for online recruitment. The present study aimed to assess these aspects of online recruitment. Two mental health surveys used advertisements within a social network website (Facebook) to recruit adult Australian participants. The initial survey used advertisements linking directly to an external survey website, and recruited 1283 participants at $9.82 per completed survey. A subsequent survey used advertisements linking to a Facebook page that featured links to the external survey, recruiting 610 participants at $1.51 per completion. Both surveys were more cost\u2010effective than similar postal surveys conducted previously, which averaged $19.10 per completion. Online and postal surveys both had somewhat unrepresentative samples. However, online surveys tended to be more successful in recruiting hard\u2010to\u2010reach populations. Advertising using \u201cproblem\u201d terminology was more effective than \u201cpositive\u201d terminology, while there was no significant effect of altruistic versus self\u2010gain terminology. Online recruitment is efficient, flexible and cost\u2010effective, suggesting that online recruitment has considerable potential for specific research designs.

One hundred and two children (48 girls) aged 3.6\u20136 years completed the Test of Emotion Comprehension ( TEC ) that comprised external and mental components, the Coloured Progressive Matrices and the Test for Reception of Grammar. Regression analysis showed that fluid intelligence was not equally related to the external and mental components of the TEC (Pons &amp; Harris, 2000). Specifically, the results indicated that the external component was related to age and verbal ability only, whereas recognition of mental emotional patterns required abstract reasoning skills more than age and verbal ability. It is concluded that the development of fluid intelligence has a significant role in the development of mental component of emotion comprehension.",

      "abstract": "Although neural activity often reflects the processing of external inputs, intrinsic fluctuations in activity have been observed throughout the brain. These may relate to patterns of self-generated thought that can occur while not performing goal-driven tasks. To understand the relationship between self-generated mental activity and intrinsic neural fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences during the acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a part of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative, and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example, individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula, and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory processes. These data provide evidence that self-generated thought is a heterogeneous category of experience and that studying its content can be helpful in understanding brain dynamics.",

Design/methodology/approach This investigation tests a conceptual model for what leaves positive mental imprints and analyzes the results of the survey to test the hypotheses. Further, the rather uncommon setting, a winter amusement park in Norway, helps to increase the external validity. Findings One interesting discovery with practical implications for management is that both ambience factors \u2013 light, sound, and smells \u2013 and interaction among customers have significance for customers' positive emotions. Research limitations/implications There is a need for further research to clarify the distinction between design and ambience factors. Practical implications Both ambience and interaction between customers are very important for successfully providing positive customer experiences. Originality/value Responding to the need to focus on the different aspects relating to customer experiences and emotions within the framework of tourism, this study tests an original model in an uncommon setting, thus contributing to the external validity of these claims.",

The following experiments provide behavioral evidence that the auditory content of inner speech is provided by corollary discharge. Corollary discharge is the motor system's prediction of the sensory consequences of its actions. This prediction can bias perception of other sensations, pushing percepts to match with prediction. The two experiments below show this bias induced by inner speech, demonstrating that inner speech causes external sounds to be heard as similar to the imagined speech, and that this bias operates on subphonemic content.",

      "abstract": "One of the most persistent health disparities is the underutilization of mental health services by people of color. Neither evidence-based treatments (universal focus) nor culturally adapted treatments (group focus) have reduced these disparities. We propose the personal relevance of psychotherapy (PROP) model, which integrates universal, group, and individual dimensions to determine the personal relevance of interventions. A cultural example of personal relevance among people of East Asian ancestry involves \"face\" (i.e., one's prestige and position in society), which may moderate treatment outcomes. Pragmatic intervention approaches focused on helping individuals cope with specific external problems, compared to managing a \"personal\" disease, can effectively \"restore\" face. Thus, social problem-solving interventions may be more personally relevant to many people of East Asian ancestry than are approaches that are internally focused. In addition, we posit that social neuroscience can offer unique opportunities above and beyond self-report measures when assessing the impact of PROP and the personal relevance of interventions for diverse populations. Our preliminary evidence upon testing this hypothesis indicated that among Asian Americans, exposure to problem-solving therapy content elicited significantly greater neural activity in brain areas associated with personal relevance compared to exposure to cognitive-behavioral therapy content. Identifying personally relevant interventions has the potential to reduce mental health disparities by increasing engagement with mental health services for diverse groups. The increased client engagement produced by personally relevant interventions also has the potential to make mental health services more effective for diverse groups.

      "abstract": "Inner speech is one of the most common, but least investigated, mental activities humans perform. It is an internal copy of one\u2019s external voice and so is similar to a well-established component of motor control: corollary discharge. Corollary discharge is a prediction of the sound of one\u2019s voice generated by the motor system. This prediction is normally used to filter self-caused sounds from perception, which segregates them from externally caused sounds and prevents the sensory confusion that would otherwise result. The similarity between inner speech and corollary discharge motivates the theory, tested here, that corollary discharge provides the sensory content of inner speech. The results reported here show that inner speech attenuates the impact of external sounds. This attenuation was measured using a context effect (an influence of contextual speech sounds on the perception of subsequent speech sounds), which weakens in the presence of speech imagery that matches the context sound. Results from a control experiment demonstrated this weakening in external speech as well. Such sensory attenuation is a hallmark of corollary discharge.",

The mental life involves the study of the earliest phases of mental development, that is during the first three years of life. Awareness of the way in which the content and form of phantasy at any given time are bound up with the successive phases of instinctual development, and of the growth of the ego, is always operating in the analyst's mind. The relation between the oral phantasies of incorporation and the earliest processes of introjection has been discussed by Anna Freud in his essay on 'Negation'. But Freud's discoveries soon led him to recognize the existence of unconscious phantasies. Freud discovered that patients repeat towards their analyst situations of feeling and impulse, and mental processes generally, which have been experienced earlier on in their relationships to people in their external lives and personal histories.",

      "abstract": "Accessible summary Despite the potential positive impact of shared decision making on service users knowledge and experience of decisional conflict, there is a lack of qualitative research on how participation in decision making is promoted from the perspective of psychiatric service users. This study highlights the desire of users to participate more actively in decision making and demonstrates that persons with SMI struggle to be seen as competent and equal partners in decision\u2010making situations. Those interviewed did not feel that their strengths, abilities and needs were being recognized, which resulted in a feeling of being omitted from involvement in decision\u2010making situations. The service users describe some essential conditions that could work to promote participation in decision making. These included having personal support, having access to knowledge, being involved in a dialogue and clarity about responsibilities. Mental health nurses can play an essential role for developing and implementing shared decision making as a tool to promote recovery\u2010oriented mental health services. Abstract Service user participation in decision making is considered an essential component of recovery\u2010oriented mental health services. Despite the potential of shared decision making to impact service users knowledge and positively influence their experience of decisional conflict, there is a lack of qualitative research on how participation in decision making is promoted from the perspective of psychiatric service users. In order to develop concrete methods that facilitate shared decision making, there is a need for increased knowledge regarding the users' own perspective. The aim of this study was to explore users' experiences of participation in decisions in mental health services in S weden, and the kinds of support that may promote participation. C onstructivist G rounded T heory ( CGT ) was utilized to analyse group and individual interviews with 20 users with experience of serious mental illness. The core category that emerged in the analysis described a \u2018struggle to be perceived as a competent and equal person\u2019 while three related categories including being the underdog, being controlled and being omitted described the difficulties of participating in decisions. The data analysis resulted in a model that describes internal and external conditions that influence the promotion of participation in decision making. The findings offer new insights from a user perspective and these can be utilized to develop and investigate concrete methods in order to promote user's participation in decisions.",

Such attentional lapses have often been characterized as the simple opposite of external sustained attention, but the different types of attentional lapses, and the subjective experiences to which they correspond, remain unspecified. In this study, we showed that unmedicated children (ages 6\u201312) with ADHD, when probed during a standard go/no-go task, reported more mind blanking (a mental state characterized by the absence of reportable content) than did control participants. This increase in mind blanking happened at the expense of both focused and wandering thoughts. We also found that methylphenidate reverted the level of mind blanking to baseline (i.e., the level of mind blanking reported by control children without ADHD). However, this restoration led to mind wandering more than to focused attention. In a second experiment, we extended these findings to adults who had subclinical ADHD. These results suggest that executive functions impaired in ADHD are required not only to sustain external attention but also to maintain an internal train of thought.",
