In linguistics, in particular in the tradition of generative grammar, the distinction is between pronouns and R-expressions.

Both experiments indicate that, for certain central cases, Westerners are more likely than East Asians to report intuitions that are consistent with the causal-historical view. These results constitute prima facie evidence that semantic intuitions vary from culture to culture, and the paper argues that this fact raises questions about the nature of the philosophical enterprise of developing a theory of reference",

Let\u2019s change rules a) and b.2) on: a*) every formula A either stands or doesn&#x27;t stand for truth, b.2*) the formula A has value F iff the formula A doesn&#x27;t stand for truth.
