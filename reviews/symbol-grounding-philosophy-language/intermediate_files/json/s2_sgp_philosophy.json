It focuses on the notion of the interpretability of syntax and how the symbols are integrated in a unity (\"binding problem\"). Utilizing the DNA code as a model, this paper discusses how syntactic features could be defined as high-grade characteristics of the non syntactic relations in a material-dynamic structure, by using an emergentist approach. This topic furnishes the ground for a confutation of J. Searle\u2019s statement that syntax is observer-relative, as he wrote in his book \"Mind: A Brief Introduction\". Moreover the evolving discussion also modifies the classic symbol-processing doctrine in the mind which Searle attacks as a strong AL argument, that life could be implemented in a computational mode. Lastly, this paper furnishes a new way of support for the autonomous systems thesis in Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence, using, inter alia, the \"adaptive resonance theory\" (ART).",

      "abstract": "The goal of the paper is to develop and propose a general model of the state space of AI. Given the breathtaking progress in AI research and technologies in recent years, such conceptual work is of substantial theoretical interest. The present AI hype is mainly driven by the triumph of deep learning neural networks. As the distinguishing feature of such networks is the ability to self-learn, self-learning is identified as one important dimension of the AI state space. Another dimension is recognized as generalization, the possibility to go over from specific to more general types of problems. A third dimension is semantic grounding. Our overall analysis connects to a number of known foundational issues in the philosophy of mind and cognition: the blockhead objection, the Turing test, the symbol grounding problem, the Chinese room argument, and use theories of meaning. It shall finally be argued that the dimension of grounding decomposes into three sub-dimensions. And the dimension of self-learning turns out as only one of a whole range of \u201cself-x-capacities\u201d (based on ideas of organic computing) that span the self-x-subspace of the full AI state space.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT). We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\\\"odelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible\"worlds\"(data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the\"grounding act\"of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.",

Starting out with countering the arguments of Bender and Koller (2020), we trace the origins of the SGP to the computational theory of mind (CTM), and we show that it only arises with natural language when questionable theories of meaning are presupposed. We conclude by showing that it would apply to LLMs only if they were interpreted in the manner of how the CTM conceives the mind, i.e., by postulating that LLMs rely on a version of a language of thought, or by adopting said questionable theories of meaning; since neither option is rational, we conclude that the SGP does not apply to LLMs.",

While many solutions to this problem have been proposed, all of them have encountered inconsistencies to different extents. A recent approach for resolving the problem is to divide the SGP into hard and easy problems echoing the distinction between hard and easy problems for resolving the enigma of consciousness. This however turns out not to be an ideal strategy: Everything related to consciousness that cannot be well-explained by present theories can be categorized as a hard problem which as a consequence would doom the SGP to irresolvability. We therefore argue that the SGP can be regarded as a general problem of how an AI system can have intentionality, and develop a theoretical direction for its solution.",

Two of the most fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem, administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical challenges.",

      "abstract": "This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We distinguish between internal meaning (sense), which formal systems can possess via axioms, and external grounding (reference), which is a necessary condition for connecting symbols to the world. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaningful grounding within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-fixed algorithmic. First, we show that for a purely symbolic system, the impossibility of grounding is a direct consequence of its definition. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings (Semantic Axioms). By formally modeling the computationalist hypothesis-which equates grounding with internal derivation-we prove via G\\\"odelian arguments that such systems cannot consistently and completely define a\"groundability predicate\"for all truths. Third, we demonstrate that the\"grounding act\"for emergent meanings cannot be inferred from internal rules but requires an axiomatic, meta-level update. Drawing on Turing's concept of Oracle Machines and Piccinini's analysis of the mathematical objection, we identify this update as physical transduction. Finally, we prove that this process cannot be simulated by a fixed judgment algorithm, validating the logical necessity of embodied interaction.",

This is demonstrated with regard to the symbol grounding problem in AI by considering that meaning is not the outcome of a two-way relation between an object and a brain (or AI) but of the negotiation of meaning in the triadic relation between objects, symbols, and human practices. This is common in the interpretive social research tradition of the humanities. We argue that AI benefits from embedding generative methods in interpretive social research methodologies. This can be achieved by using the example of the recently developed methodology of interpretive agent-based simulation (iABM). This methodology enables the generation of counterfactual narratives anchored in ethnographic evidence and hermeneutically interpreted, producing symbolically grounded and plausible futures. Criteria for plausibility correspond to contemporary guidelines for assessing trustworthy AI, namely human agency and oversight, transparency, and auditability.",

While neural networks excel at pattern recognition, they struggle to maintain logical consistency. Conversely, symbolic systems provide formal reasoning capabilities but lack mechanisms for handling perceptual uncertainty. This paper introduces EmALC , a novel neuro-symbolic framework that bridges neural perception with symbolic logic through differentiable fuzzy semantics. Our approach addresses a key limitation of existing methods: while previous neuro-symbolic approaches like Logic Tensor Networks employ first-order fuzzy logic, where key reasoning problems are undecidable, EmALC ensures decidable reasoning by leveraging a fuzzy variant of ALC -- a decidable fragment of first-order logic. Unlike previous approaches that often compromise logical soundness for learning capability, EmALC maintains provable semantic consistency through a hierarchical loss function while mitigating reasoning shortcuts via rule-based revision strategies. Experimental evaluation demonstrates EmALC's effectiveness: on ontology revision tasks, it achieves 100% success rate in correcting masked groundings while preserving semantic integrity; on semantic image interpretation tasks, it improves object classification F1-scores by up to 5.56% through ontology-guided knowledge revision.",

      "abstract": "Language requires the capacity to link symbols (words, sentences) through the intermediary of internal representations to the physical world, a process known as symbol grounding. One of the biggest debates in the cognitive sciences concerns the question how human brains are able to do this. Do we need a material explanation or a system explanation? John Searle's well known Chinese Room thought experiment, which continues to generate a vast polemic literature of arguments and counter-arguments, has argued that autonomously establishing internal representations of the world (called 'intentionality' in philosophical parlance) is based on special properties of human neural tissue and that consequently an artificial system, such as an autonomous physical robot, can never achieve this. Here we study the Grounded Naming Game as a particular example of symbolic interaction and investigate a dynamical system that autonomously builds up and uses the semiotic networks necessary for performance in the game. We demonstrate in real experiments with physical robots that such a dynamical system indeed leads to a successful emergent communication system and hence that symbol grounding and intentionality can be explained in terms of a particular kind of system dynamics. The human brain has obviously the right mechanisms to participate in this kind of dynamics but the same dynamics can also be embodied in other types of physical systems.",

      "abstract": "A great deal of contention can be found within the published literature on grounding and the symbol grounding problem, much of it motivated by appeals to intuition and unfalsifiable claims. We seek to define a formal framework of representa tion grounding that is independent of any particular opinion, but that promotes classification and comparison. To this end, we identify a set of fundamental concepts and then formalize a hierarchy of six representational system classes that correspond to different perspectives on the representational requirements for intelligence, describing a spectrum of systems built on representations that range from symbolic through iconic to distributed and unconstrained. This framework offers utility not only in enriching our understanding of symbol grounding and the literature, but also in exposing crucial assumptions to be explored by the research community.",
