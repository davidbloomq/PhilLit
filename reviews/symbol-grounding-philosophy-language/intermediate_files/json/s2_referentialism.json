      "abstract": "\n\n\nJokes, whether oral or written, are part of the linguistic context of most individuals within a community, although they have not been considered a significant topic in philosophical discussions in recent years. However, reflecting on jokes can be useful for understanding various issues in the philosophy of language, particularly those related to names and meaningfulness. One of the main proposals of this article is to use a common linguistic practice to conduct a panoramic review of the problem of meaning through the analytical method. For this purpose, we will analyze a specific written joke: the phrase hoy no f\u00edo, ma\u00f1ana s\u00ed (\"today I don't give credit, tomorrow I will\"), which appears in various neighborhood shops across Latin America. This phrase will serve as an example to address the theses of referentialism, as proposed by Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke; descriptivism, as developed by G. Frege, J. Searle, and P. Strawson; and contextualism, as formulated by L. Wittgenstein and J. Austin. These three frameworks will allow for an explanatory and comprehensive approach to the problematic components involved. This article aims to promote the social appropriation of specific knowledge regarding a shared linguistic everydayness and to demonstrate the application of these paradigms to ordinary circumstances through normative contextualism, without trivializing the context in which we live, while recognizing the practical consequences that may arise from employing the language game inherent to jokes.\n\n\n",

Moore applied referential theory\u00a0of meaning in two famous arguments: The Refutation of Idealism and The Open\u00a0Question Argument.

      "abstract": "The Malay mind is explicitly and implicitly expressed in the works of Malay literature. The thinking in the lyrics of folk songs, in particular, those of \u201cBangau Oh Bangau\u201d and \u201cBurung Kenek-Kenek\u201d, give emphasis to social and moral values as well as the role of custom in community lives. These songs draw attention to the Malay philosophy that is related to metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic and aesthetic through their interaction with nature as well as the surrounding plant and animal kingdoms. This study aims to identify the philosophy, language and thinking in the lyrics of \u201cBangau Oh Bangau\u201d and \u201cBurung Kenek-Kenek\u201d by employing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The quantitative method employed in the present study is the text analysis method. The study has identified four Malay philosophy and thinking in \u201cBangau Oh Bangau\u201d: sarcasm with regard to the culture of shifting the blame, sarcasm concerning the indifferent attitude of the society, sincerity in action or planning, and philosophy or principle of life. The philosophy and thinking in the lyrics for \u201cBurung Kenek-kenek\u201d encourage one to strive for piousness, filial piety and noble character (humility). The study has also shown the link between philosophy, language, and thoughts in the lyrics of Malay songs, in particular, \u201cBangau Oh Bangau\u201d and \u201cBurung Kenek-Kenek\u201d, as stated in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. In summary, analysis of the lyrics of \u201cBangau Oh Bangau\u201d and \u201cBurung Kenek-Kenek\u201d has brought into the open the superiority of Malay thinking and creativity in composing the lyrics of Malay songs that are inspired by nature.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The digital age has transformed the way humans use, interpret, and experience language. Traditional philosophical concerns\u2014such as meaning, reference, truth, and communication\u2014must now be re-examined in the context of new linguistic practices shaped by digital technologies. Social media platforms, artificial intelligence, emojis, memes, and algorithm-driven interactions have introduced novel forms of expression that challenge conventional theories of semantics and pragmatics. This paper explores the philosophical implications of digital communication, focusing on how meaning is constructed, negotiated, and altered in virtual spaces. It examines the interplay between brevity and nuance in online discourse, the impact of anonymity and identity fluidity on speech acts, and the ethical dimensions of language mediated by algorithms. \nResults/Analysis: The digital age has not only revolutionized the tools of communication but also redefined the very nature of linguistic interaction. Classical philosophy of language, grounded in speech and text, must now be reinterpreted in light of digital practices that are multimodal, fragmented, and technologically mediated. Meaning today is not limited to words alone; it is constructed through symbols, images, hashtags, and even silence within algorithmically curated platforms.\nMethodology: In this paper, the exploratory qualitative research method is used. The relevant information is collected using keyword-based search in Google search engine, Google Scholar search engine, and AI-driven GPTs. This information is analysed and interpreted as per the objectives of the paper.\nOriginality/Values: The study engages with contemporary questions of authenticity, misinformation, and linguistic creativity in digital environments. By bridging classical philosophy of language with the realities of digital communication, the paper argues for an expanded framework that accounts for multimodal, networked, and technologically mediated forms of meaning-making. Ultimately, rethinking language in the digital age offers not only a deeper understanding of communication but also an opportunity to develop more ethical and inclusive linguistic practices in a rapidly evolving world.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:As the philosophy of music education further internationalizes with Asian philosophies in recent years, the problem of language is a crucial issue that can no longer be ignored. When mining ideas originally written in non-English languages, is it possible to truly know what was said or written? Is knowledge of the original language necessary? When interpreting and quoting non-English philosophical texts, what does it mean to do philosophy with integrity and in a philosophically responsible manner? These questions resist simple answers. To this end, I delimit this paper to three central themes: doubt, rigor, and humility, which offer implications for publications, leadership, and gatekeeping in our field as it continues to internationalize. While I draw examples primarily from the vexing problem of interpreting and presenting Chinese philosophical texts to English readers, the ideas offered may also be applied to work involving texts in other non-English languages. I conclude by arguing that while vexing, the problem of language is simultaneously liberating\u2014one that expands the limits of our worlds for the melioration of music education.",

      "abstract": "The analytic-synthetic1 distinction is one of the controversial and also essential issues to understand many developments in logic, philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics in contemporary philosophy. This paper examines the discussion on analytic-synthetic distinction in Kant and Quine\u2019s philosophy with the aim of placing exactly what is at stake. In the course of this discussion, I will try to make analyse their arguments that what exactly analytic-synthetic distinction claims and by doing so assess the so-called alikenesses between them. In the Critique of Pure Reason2 Kant says the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgements in three distinct ways: analytic judgements are those (1) \u2018in which [...] the predicate B belongs to the subject A, as something which is (covertly) contained in this concept A\u2019, instantly pursuing this we are acquainted that analytic judgements are those (2) \u2018in which the connection of predicate with the subject is thought through identity\u2019, the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgements can be added by the concept that (3) \u2018[Analytic judgements], adding nothing through the predicate to the concept of the subject [\u2026] can also be entitled explicative. From another point of view in the synthetic judgements, the predicate lies outside the subject concept. It adds something new to the subject concept. It gives new information about the subject term\u2019. Quine appraises Kant as the one who first amply showed the importance of the analytic-synthetic distinction and engaged with the predicaments in Kant\u2019s position to re-conceptualise the whole relationship between logic, language and meaning. His famous objections to analyticity in \u2018Two Dogmas of Empiricism\u2019 3 asserts that a \u201cfundamental cleavage between truths which are analytic, or grounded in meanings, independently of matters of fact, and truths which are synthetic, or grounded in fact,\u201d is an essential dogma of modem empiricism. After examining the presumptions, the paper concludes that the disagreement between Kant and Quine\u2019s different approaches on the notion of analyticity-synthetic distinction is rooted against the traditional philosophy. In Kant\u2019s philosophy the distinction between analytic-synthetic is not only important for the renunciation of traditional approaches of the so-called dogmatic, metaphysics, but it is also important in his inquiry into the possibility of metaphysics as a rational science. Quine accepted a radical naturalization of philosophy, such that philosophy would be continuous with empirical science, as its slightly more abstract and reflective branch. His attack on analytic-synthetic distinction and conceptual analysis has also had an inadvertent, and somewhat ironic and opened the door to a new wave of metaphysical theorizing by opposing the stand of Logical Positivism, which considered metaphysical inquiries as nonsensical. But as we will see, the way the distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments operates within these worthy forms out to differ substantially between Kant and Quine.",

      "abstract": "Al-Far\u0101b\u012b\u2019s contributions to Islamic philosophy extend deeply into the philosophy of language, yet scholarly attention to this dimension remains limited. This study re-examines al-Far\u0101b\u012b\u2019s linguistic philosophy by focusing on three interrelated dimensions: logic, symbol, and reasoning. The background of the research lies in the need to reassess classical frameworks in light of contemporary debates on language, cognition, and meaning, where non-Western traditions remain underrepresented. The objective is to explicate how al-Far\u0101b\u012b conceptualizes language not merely as a communicative tool, but as an epistemic system for organizing rational thought and symbolic representation. Using a qualitative method, the study employs textual-philosophical analysis of al-Far\u0101b\u012b\u2019s major works, including Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ur\u016bf, Kit\u0101b al-Alf\u0101\u1e93 al-Musta\u2018mala f\u012b al-Man\u1e6diq, and his commentary on De Interpretatione, supported by recent scholarly findings. The results reveal that al-Far\u0101b\u012b understands language as a structured expression of the intellect, capable of conveying both demonstrative propositions and imaginative constructs. His classification of syllogisms into demonstrative, dialectical, rhetorical, poetic, and sophistical shows the multiplicity of language functions, each with distinct epistemological and moral purposes. Furthermore, his reflections on metaphor, rhetoric, and prophetic discourse demonstrate the cognitive and ethical role of symbolic language in shaping society and cultivating virtue. The study concludes that al-Far\u0101b\u012b\u2019s philosophy of language integrates logical rigor with symbolic depth, offering an early model of semiotic realism in which words, concepts, and referents form a triadic relationship grounded in reason and truth. This synthesis provides a foundational contribution to the Islamic intellectual tradition while also enriching contemporary philosophy of language, hermeneutics, and intercultural dialogue.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the construction and deconstruction of black humor schemata in American literature from the perspective of the philosophy of language, using Joseph Heller\u2019s \u2018Catch-22\u2019 as a case study. Black humor, characterized by its ironic, absurd, and satirical elements, presents a unique narrative technique that challenges conventional literary forms and critiques sociopolitical structures. This research employs a combined methodology of textual analysis and philosophical inquiry to dissect the narrative devices and thematic elements Heller employs to construct black humor. The analysis reveals how Heller\u2019s use of paradox, anti-heroism, and incongruity not only constructs a distinct humor but also deconstructs traditional wartime narratives, reflecting broader existential and linguistic concerns. Through a detailed examination of key passages and motifs in \u2018Catch-22,\u2019 the study provides insights into the intricate relationship between language, humor, and meaning in literary contexts. This paper discusses the theoretical underpinnings of black humor within the framework of language philosophy, examines its manifestation in Heller\u2019s work, and explores its implications for contemporary literary theory. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of how black humor functions as both a narrative strategy and a philosophical critique, offering new perspectives on its role in American literature.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the complex relationship between language and philosophy, focusing on the weaknesses of language and the role of analytic philosophy in epistemology. The main problems raised include the ambiguity of language, its limitations in conveying abstract concepts, and its impact on philosophical thought. This research uses a qualitative method through content analysis and literature studies of the works of philosophers such as Wittgenstein, Russell, and Gettier, as well as a hermeneutic approach to interpreting texts contextually. It aims to examine how language affects philosophical understanding and how analytic philosophy seeks to address the weaknesses of language through logical and semantic analysis. The results show that language, although vital in communication and the construction of reality has limitations such as ambiguity and dependence on context. Analytic philosophy plays a role in clarifying meaning, analyzing concepts, and overcoming misunderstandings through an epistemological approach. This article suggests the need for further research on language in the context of digital technologies and the integration of language philosophy into the educational curriculum to enrich cross-disciplinary understanding. Implicitly, collaborations with cognitive sciences and sociology can provide new insights into the dynamics of language and thought.",

This movement seeks to re-establish the legitimacy of Chinese philosophy in a novel manner. While it has gained substantial traction within Chinese academia, it has found little resonance among international scholars of Chinese philosophy. This prompts a critical examination: What does \u201cChinese-language philosophy\u201d encompass? What were the circumstances of its emergence and the reasons for its prominence within Chinese academia? Is Chinese philosophy inherently a language-specific philosophy? These questions form the core of our exploration, intending to clarify the name and nature of \u201cChinese-language philosophy.\u201d We caution against an overemphasis on the role of language in philosophy, as it may lead to a language-centric ontology that overlooks the fundamental underpinnings shared by all philosophical traditions across cultures and inherent in all human languages\u2014namely, the lived experiences and social practices of human beings.",

The article\u2019s authors set the goal of examining the specifics of studies on ontological characteristics of language through the prism of its cultural representation, analysing Losev\u2019s conceptual framework. In this regard the authors set the following tasks: firstly, to determine the pre-object structure of the name as a mythologeme, by highlighting the primary status of the advancement from the internal sense, related to the existential foundations of life, to its external representations; secondly, to analyze the reverse motion from essence to its appearances as realized in the word expressing the fullness of individual and cultural meanings. In accordance with the set tasks, the results of the study follow the general logic of Losev\u2019s conceptualizations. The dialectic of Losev\u2019s reasoning combines the appraisal of the ascent to the Absolute in understanding the name, on the one hand, with the significance of the descent to the word with its agile lively content, on the other. Losev integrates these two trends in language development through myth, which he sees as a living reality\u2014an actual manifestation of essence fixed in a name. The conclusions are indicated by appealing to the ontological Pan-Unity allowing Losev to integrate the ideas of man and the world, to connect reality to thought in the context of universal relations the wholeness of which becomes real in the living space of culture.",

      "abstract": "This study examined the educational philosophies and teaching styles of Language and Literature (LL) teachers in Northern Samar, with the aim of describing the relationship between teachers\u2019 philosophical orientations and their instructional practices. A descriptive\u2013quantitative research design was employed, using a standardized survey conveniently responded by 20 LL teachers. The data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, and cross-tabulation. Results revealed that the respondents are mostly female, predominantly female, young to mid-career, moderately experienced, and academically well-prepared. Moreover, the majority of teachers adhered to Progressivism (55%), reflecting a learner-centered orientation that emphasizes inquiry, experiential learning, and democratic participation. Existentialism (20%) and Eclecticism (15%) followed, while Essentialism and Perennialism were minimally represented (5% each). In terms of teaching styles, the Delegator (40%) emerged as the most dominant, followed by teachers who employed a Combination of styles (25%), the Personal Model (20%), the Expert (10%), and the Authority (5%) approach. Cross-tabulation indicated a strong alignment between Progressivist philosophy and Delegator/Personal Model styles, while existentialist teachers balanced between Delegator and Expert orientations. Eclectic teachers demonstrated corresponding flexibility in their teaching styles. The findings suggest that LL teachers largely reflect global and national educational trends favoring student-centered and flexible pedagogies, while the limited presence of teacher-centered approaches signals a gradual decline of traditionalist models. It is recommended that professional development programs emphasize inquiry-based and collaborative learning strategies; curriculum implementation support eclectic practices to address diverse learners\u2019 needs; DepEd and CHED sustain policies encouraging postgraduate studies to enhance teachers\u2019 philosophical and pedagogical maturity; and further studies be conducted in the province and across different regions to validate and expand these findings.",

      "abstract": "B a c k g r o u n d . In current debates about knowledge, the contextualist approach \u2013 especially its reliance on how people use the word \"know\" in everyday conversations \u2013 has faced growing criticism. The core issue is this: just because something is commonly said doesn't mean it should be taken as a solid basis for building a theory. Everyday ways of speaking may reflect certain habits or intuitions, but they don't automatically justify splitting knowledge into different types \u2013 like \"low-standard knowledge\" (L-knowledge) and \"high-standard knowledge\" (H-knowledge). In short, the contextualist argument, which claims that what counts as knowledge depends on the situation, doesn't hold up. Its reliance on linguistic habits is too weak to support the weight of its theoretical conclusions.\n\nM e t h o d s . This study uses conceptual analysis to clarify how different kinds of knowledge are understood \u2013 particularly the difference between low-, medium-, and high-standard knowledge. It also draws on historical and philosophical research, including a close look at major thinkers and recent theories.\n\nR e s u l t s . One key finding is that high-standard knowledge (H-knowledge) \u2013 the kind that demands complete certainty \u2013 doesn't work in practice. It adds no real value to how we talk, reason, or act together. If only infallible knowledge counted, most everyday claims to \"know\" something would fall apart. Worse still, the kind of extreme doubt used to justify H-knowledge is destructive \u2013 it erases even ordinary, useful knowledge and breaks down our ability to think or act with any confidence.\n\nIn contrast, low-standard knowledge (L-knowledge), where certainty isn't required, proves both useful and defensible. This idea traces back to thinkers like N. Malcolm and fits well with how we actually reason and communicate. Keeping this fallible \u2013 but functional \u2013 idea of knowledge allows us to tell the difference between informed belief and mere guesswork. It also helps language and teamwork function effectively. So L-knowledge isn't a weaker form of knowing \u2013 it's a practical tool for dealing with uncertainty and making decisions.\n\nC o n c l u s i o n s . The paper argues that H-knowledge and L-knowledge can't be combined into a single theory. They come from fundamentally different ways of thinking about what it means to \"know\". There's no middle ground here: a choice must be made. And the better choice, as argued, is fallibilism \u2013 the view that knowledge can still be valid even if it isn't perfect. Radical doubt still plays an important role in philosophy, but it shouldn't push us to demand impossible standards. Instead, it should remind us why more flexible, realistic standards work better. In the end, the fallibilist approach doesn't represent a compromise \u2013 it's the only workable foundation for a consistent and useful theory of knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The past decade has seen notable development of conceptual engineering \u2013 a field of analytical philosophy that focuses on the critical evaluation of concepts. Most authors engaged with this area identify Rudolf Carnap\u2019s ideas as its methodological framework and theoretical origin, placing particular emphasis on the philosopher\u2019s method of explication. This article highlights the unquestionable influence Carnap\u2019s thought had on conceptual engineering whilst by no means reducing it to the utilisation and advancement of explication within this field of analytical philosophy: indeed, conceptual engineering has incorporated \u2013 and brought to the forefront \u2013 much broader tenets of Carnap\u2019s concept. This study draws on a series of the philosopher\u2019s works, as well as his \u2018Intellectual Autobiography\u2019, to trace the evolution of his ideas about language and describe the fundamental elements revealing the \u2018engineering perspective\u2019 in his reflection. Most clearly, this perspective is evident in his interpretation of logic as a conceptual tool for acquiring and processing knowledge, \u2018assembling\u2019 it into a structure and refining the procedures of logic itself. It is shown that the origins of the engineering perspective trace back, on the one hand, to Carnap\u2019s interest in the methodological framework of physics, particularly the measurement problem and its epistemological analysis, and, on the other, his fascination with interpretations of the nature of mathematical theory and the idea of unifying logicism and formalism by introducing the principle of tolerance, which adds a pragmatic dimension to methodology. The article examines in detail the idea of explication and its theoretical origins, which lie, in particular, in Carnap\u2019s intention to exactify the notions expressing the degree of validity and probability. His idea of a link between the results of explication and its goal became the central principle of conceptual engineering, distinguishing it from mere conceptual analysis. It is concluded that, when considered together, Carnap\u2019s two major ideas \u2013 explication and the principle of tolerance \u2013 can be placed in a broader context of a project seeking a rational reconstruction of the life of society and providing it with knowledge-based underpinnings.",

This paper responds to C&D\u2019s argument, develops an account of the distinction, and applies it to philosophy of language. Section 1 summarizes C&D\u2019s argument against Charles Mills\u2019s version of the distinction. Section 2 develops an account of the distinction that\u2019s inspired by Mills\u2019s work but that differs from what C&D take Mills\u2019s view to be. Section 3 shows that, pace C&D, this distinction picks out interesting subsets of work in philosophy of language. We say that ideal theories adopt models of the social world that fail to recognize systemic oppression and are therefore systematically inaccurate. Nonideal theories correct these inaccuracies.",

Oxford\u2019s contributions to academia extend well beyond language learning strategy research, for which she is well known, to embrace peace education in language classrooms. Inspired by her peace education philosophy, this study first describes the influence of Oxford\u2019s scholarly research in peace approach. Then, it presents a case study of five preservice teachers, all native Turkish speakers, who were guided to adopt the peace approach philosophy to develop creative teaching materials to be implemented in the Practicum course. Throughout six hours of weekly lessons at a state middle school, the preservice teachers integrated peacebuilding activities into their English instruction. The analysis of the qualitative data from lesson plans, classroom observations, and reflective writings, revealed compelling findings. Preservice teachers who implemented peacebuilding activities showcased increased competence and awareness of peace education philosophy, and they reported feeling more confident and fulfilled in their teaching. Children exposed to peacebuilding activities experienced a shift in their emotional state. It was also found that peacebuilding activities fostered inner harmony, boosted self-confidence, and enhanced children\u2019s English learning engagement. The study highlights the crucial role of integrating peace education into teacher education programs, particularly for language teachers.

Using a qualitative approach with descriptive methods, the research involved observations and interviews in three Raudhatul Athfal in Riau Islands. The results showed that the pragmatic approach that integrates real-life contexts, such as role-playing, is effective in improving communication skills. The semantic approach, through the introduction of real object-based vocabulary, strengthens children's understanding of meaning structures. Meanwhile, hermeneutics helps children internalise cultural and religious values through interactive stories and daily prayers. Although challenges such as lack of social environmental support and semantic complexity were encountered, great opportunities emerged through educational technology innovation and community collaboration. This research makes a theoretical contribution in the integration of philosophy of language with Arabic language teaching, as well as offering practical guidance for designing more effective and meaningful teaching methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims at examining the impotence of language or what is famously referred to as the phenomenon of inconsistency of language through the philosophy of John Locke on the abuse of language and with specific reference to the Eighth Edition of the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary authored by Hornby (2010). Locke as well stated that adequate signs which he also referred to as words are lost or corrupted especially when a word is given many meanings. By discussing selected entries of the dictionary, the present research intends to demonstrate how polysemanticity and the use or a word in different contexts can cause what Locke called language misuse. Illustrating in the case of particular examples, the study shows the potential consequence of this process for the language learners and users, stressing on the necessity to enhance the meticulousness of the language one will opt to use. The research concludes that there is need to resolve discrepancies that grow from these ambiguities for language teachers and lexicographers to improve meaning and communication, an idea supported by Locke\u2019s goal of enforcing the correct usage of language among English speakers. Results imply that teachers should draw students\u2019 attention to the fact that words\u2019 meanings cannot be understood separately from their contexts. Language educators are advised to introduce the students to the different meanings of words and contexts of their use.",

      "abstract": "B a c k g r o u n d . According to a common prejudice, especially prevalent among philosophers in the continental tradition, the philosophy of everyday language (sometimes referred to as Oxford philosophy), with its focus on what we usually say and mean, fundamentally expresses a positivist attitude. Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979), who significantly contributed to the spread of this view, interprets the appeal to the concept analysis in these philosophers' writings as purely ideological: it fails to recognize the constructed nature of the social and views the social as a domain of brute facts where critical thinking should cease. Therefore, to grasp the essence of the ordinary language philosophy, it is crucial to identify the prerequisites for the emergence of this philosophical style and delve into its historical context. M e t h o d s . In this article, the author employs the method of historical-philosophical reconstruction to clarify the conditions of the formation and genesis of Oxford philosophy. General scientific methods of cognition \u2013 such as analysis, synthesis, and generalization \u2013 are used to elucidate key ideas and concepts that influenced the development of Oxford philosophy's method. Additionally, methods of systematization and comparison are applied. R e s u l t s . The article identifies the historical prerequisites for the formation of Oxford philosophy, specifying the key ideas and concepts that impacted the development of the ordinary language philosophy. It clarifies the distinctions and interconnections between the concepts of the philosophy of everyday language and Oxford philosophy. C o n c l u s i o n s . For ten years following the end of the Second World War, the University of Oxford became a hub of exceptionally productive philosophical activity. This period laid the groundwork for the emergence of a new and original philosophical movement known as the \"Ordinary language philosophy\" or \"Oxford philosophy\". However, equating the ordinary language philosophy entirely with Oxford philosophy is not accurate. The former term pertains specifically to the methodology of analyzing natural language expressions in the post-World War II era. In contrast, Oxford philosophy encompasses a broader historical context, including the pre-war period of philosophical activity at the University of Oxford. Thus, Oxford philosophy should be understood as a historical-philosophical stage that ultimately led to the formation of the philosophy of everyday language.",

This article explores several pivotal inquiries regarding this trend: What does Hanyu zhexue refer to?

By drawing comparisons with the similar phenomenon of \u201cJapanese-language philosophy,\u201d we approach the prospects of \u201cChinese-language philosophy\u201d with caution. We argue that an excessive focus on language in philosophy risks fostering a language-centric ontology that overshadows the foundations shared by all philosophical traditions and human languages\u2014namely, the lived experiences and social practices of human beings.",

      "abstract": "B a c k g r o u n d . The ordinary language philosophy (OLP) is a set of interconnected philosophical approaches that have been practiced by analytical philosophers, mainly in Great Britain and the USA, since the middle of the 20th century. Its discursive space is outlined by the methodological developments and ideas of L. Wittgenstein and J. Austin, as well as the works of G. Ryall, P. Strawson, R. Hare and N. Malcolm. P. Grice and D. Davidson are often included in this school, although their works are also associated with the end of the classical period of the OLP. However, modern interest in this direction indicates the prematureness of statements about its end, setting before philosophers the task of rethinking the reasons for the temporary decline of attention and rediscovering its potential for enriching the methodology of analytic philosophy.\n\nM e t h o d s . The article used the method of historical and philosophical reconstruction to clarify the conditions for the formation of the philosophy of everyday language, general scientific methods of cognition: analysis, synthesis, generalization to clarify key ideas and concepts that influenced the formation of the method of linguistic analysis, as well as methods of systematization and comparison.\n\nR e s u l t s . Within the framework of the work, the periodization of the OLP was clarified, in particular, the stage of the early OLP and the classical period, which falls on the 50s of the twentieth century, were determined and presented by the works of representatives of the University of Oxford G. Ryle, J. Austin and P. Strawson. Also, key differences between the philosophy of ideal language, which is represented by the views of A. J. Ayer and the OLP in the interpretation of J. Wisdom, in particular, a different interpretation of linguistic analysis, were identified.\n\nC o n c l u s i o n s . Linguistic analysis takes on a completely different appearance in the interpretation of the OLP compared to the ideas of A. J. Ayer. The real value of linguistic analysis within the OLP, as J. Wisdom demonstrates, lies in its ability to demonstrate the amazing dexterity of ordinary language. Ordinary language allows us to express the most subtle distinctions, nuances of meaning, intentions, and goals. This realization refutes the thesis of ideal language, which suggests that ordinary language obscures reality. On the contrary, ordinary language uses provide a reference to reality with an impressive level of detail and descriptive power that no artificial language can surpass. This ability is due not only to the function of language as a tool of representation, but also to its evolutionary adaptation to a variety of practical needs.",

To this end, Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein tried to understand the nature of atomic propositions by examining their unity. The question of the unity of atomic propositions has not been uniformly resolved, however. Frege and Russell largely agreed on the category and role of propositions, thinking that the object represented by a proposition is a Platonic abstract entity, but they had different understandings of the unity of propositions. Wittgenstein took a different approach, holding that the object of a proposition representation is the linguistic picture entity. Based on this understanding, the problem of examining the unity of atomic propositions becomes the problem of examining the representation form and content of the proposition, thus avoiding the formal ontology of propositions. Atomic propositions are the basic unit formed by the cognitive subject in the activity of representing the world, and their nature is the unity of the transcendental intentionality of the cognitive subject and the experiential activity.",

The indexicals may be seen as private from the late-Wittgensteinian perspective because their sense (Sinn) cannot be repeated outside of a specific linguistic context of the expression. The study examines whether these indexicals presuppose a private language. If Frege's philosophy contains such privateness (for which only insufficient evidence can be found), it would be peculiar since a major part of his work implies that all thoughts are objective and publicly communicable. However, the privateness in Frege's remarks rather differs from Wittgenstein's, for the indexical's sense should be principally expressible at any time.",
