The author will first clarify the role act content plays in Brentano\u2019s philosophy of psychology and then go on to locate the proposed notion of content in the historical context of Brentano\u2019s work as well as in his writings at the time of Psychologie. The author will defend this notion against potential objections and explore its explanatory potential.",

      "abstract": "AMark of the Mental: In Defense of Informational Teleosemantics is Karen Neander\u2019s long-awaited first book. It achieves three main goals. First, it establishes teleosemantics as a leading candidate for naturalizing intentionality. Second, it develops a highly original and innovative version of teleosemantics, informational teleosemantics (IT), which stands in contrast to consumer-based accounts. Third, it offers plausible solutions to the various content indeterminacy problems that have historically plagued the topic. Throughout the book, Neander exhibits the deft interweaving of philosophy of biology and philosophy of mind that has marked her career. Stated roughly, IT says that the content of a (sensory-perceptual) representation is whatever is supposed to cause it (149). More precisely, at its most basic, IT holds that a sensory-perceptual representation, R, is about C if there is a mechanism that has the function of producing R\u2019s in response to C\u2019s (151). So, for example, a specificmidbrain activation pattern in a toadmight be about long wriggling things, if there is a mechanism in the toad\u2019s brain that has the function of producing that pattern in response to longwriggling things. In this, IT differs from consumer-oriented views, which hold that a representation\u2019s content depends on the mechanisms that utilize (consume) it. For example, in Millikan\u2019s consumer-based view, a toad\u2019s midbrain activation pattern is about worms because that is what it must correspond to for the consumer",

His aim was to develop a theory of scientific philosophy that would be characterized by vigor and exactness. While, on the one hand, Twardowski\u2019s scientific philosophy may be portrayed as strongly intellectualistic, his approach was not scientistic. It is reasonable to argue that Twardowski owed his philosophical outlook to his tutor, Franz Brentano who inspired Twardowski to make distinctions between the object and the content of a presentation within the frame of reference of mental acts\u2019 intentionality. Among his lasting contributions are (1) his formulation of the judgment-based theory of knowledge, (2) his conviction and elaboration of the concept of time-independent truth, (3) his concept of metaphilosophy, and (4) his emphasis on analysis as a viable method in philosophical deliberations.",

      "abstract": "Recent philosophy of mind has seen an increase of interest in theories of intentionality in offering a functional account of mental states. The standard intentionalist view holds that mental states can be exhaustively accounted for in terms of their representational contents. An alternative view proposed by Tim Crane, called impure intentionalism, specifies mental states in terms of intentional content, mode, and object.

And how can they give rise to actions? In his theory of exemplar causes, Su\u00e1rez examines both problems and offers a comprehensive theory. The paper first discusses his solution to the intentionality problem, arguing that he subscribes to an act theory, according to which ideas are mental acts that are about something in virtue of their specific content. The paper then reconstructs his solution to the causation problem, showing that he appeals to efficient causation: ideas are powers and hence efficient causes that immediately produce other acts, thereby triggering the production of material things. The analysis of both problems sheds light on Su\u00e1rez\u2019s broader theory of cognitive activity by showing that he takes mental acts to be intrinsically intentional and productive.",

The chapter argues that Critias\u2019 proposal that temperance is self-knowledge, and its subsequent examination by Socrates, initially offers the reader a picture of self-knowledge as a reflexive self-awareness of the content of mental states. However, the initial discussion between Socrates and Critias presents the reader with a tension between the dual demands placed on self-knowledge in that dialogue. On the one hand, since self-knowledge is directed inward, towards one\u2019s conscious states in acting temperately, it appears to be presented as reflexive. On the other, since, as a kind of knowledge, self-knowledge must be about something, and so dependent on the object it is directed towards, it is presented as exhibiting the characteristic of \u2018objective intentionality\u2019. A clue to the tension\u2019s resolution, it is argued, can be found by considering the more standard understanding of temperance as self-control, and in Charmides\u2019 characterization of temperance as a kind of \u2018quietude\u2019.",

The concept of intentionality in philosophy of mind (\u201caboutness\u201d), which is \u201cthe ineliminable mark of the mental\u201d according to Brentano, can be viewed as the relationship between model and object, and empathy can be viewed as a form of mental modelling, so that the inclination to attribute mentality can be identified with the inclination to empathise with the relevant entity. Physical information, a concept quite well established within the discipline of physics, is basically a reconceptualization of material form. Daniel Dennett's concept of the intentional stance allows the development of a concept of \u201cintentional information,\u201d a broad term that encompasses mental content and semantic information generally, as encoded within physical information/material form.",

We can make a parallel between this Husserlian threefold distinction and the Fregean sense/\u201dreference\u201d distinction, reducing it to the sense/object distinction. This paralleism is not to force the Husserl\u2019s thought to Frege\u2019s, but, on the contrary, to show the structure of the triple meaning of content: Husserl mtroduces the difference between ideal signification and instantiated signification, so the pure and Simple signification and the noematic sense are species of the genus sense. Husserl\u2019s theory of intentionality and his philosophy of language does not go Frege, but beyond. The recognition of that allows us to see the error of F\u00f8esdal\u2019s mterpretation, as while as those of Sartre and Gurwitsch. The Fregean sense/\u201dreference\u201d distinction is subsumed by the Husserlian conceptual trio ideal signification/noematic sense/object. This triad of concepts houses not only a semantic theory (as Frege\u2019s pair), but also a theory of a theory of perception. Husserl integrates its semantics in a theory of of consciousness that overcomes the intentio doctrines ofBrentano, Twardowsk1 and the medievals.",

These distinct accounts are joined together through his theory of imitation into what I call a \u2018theory of intentionality as active imitating\u2019, but without giving relations of likeness any work to do in the account. In each part of the account, Aquinas draws on a general metaphysical schema that applies to both mental and non-mental being, contra interpretations that view intentionality as a sui generis feature of mental states.",

      "abstract": "This paper dwells on the understanding of intentionality by J. Searle, who developed the problem of intentionality as the core of the philosophy of mind. The research is relevant since the philosophy of mind occupies a prominent place in analytic philosophy, Searle\u2019s concept of consciousness being central in this context. The purpose of the article is to describe Searle\u2019s view on the problem of intentionality. He had to face the position that mental states (consciousness) do not exist, which was expressed by many representatives of analytic philosophy, including G. Ryle and D. Dennett. They relied on the ideas of behaviourism, with its stimulus-response formula, excluding consciousness as the mediator in this process. The paper demonstrates Searle\u2019s arguments in defence of the existence of mental states. Moreover, Searle pointed out a criterion of the existence of consciousness, namely, intentionality. This criterion made it possible to draw a demarcation line between physical and mental states. Searle attempted to overcome the dualism of consciousness and physical processes, which was important since dualism was the subject of constant criticism from naturalists. The article uses the method of historical and philosophical analysis, comparative method and theoretical reconstruction. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that it demonstrates Searle\u2019s significant contribution both to the problem of consciousness, by showing its specificity, and to the problem of intentionality.",

      "abstract": "This Element provides a comprehensive introduction to contemporary theories of mental content. After clarifying central concepts and identifying the questions that dominate the current debate, it presents and discusses the principal accounts of the nature of mental content (or mental representation), which include causal, informational, teleological and structuralist approaches, alongside the phenomenal intentionality approach and the intentional stance theory. Additionally, it examines anti-representationalist accounts which question either the existence or the explanatory relevance of mental content. Finally, the Element concludes by considering some recent developments in the debate about mental content, specifically the \u201cexplanatory turn\u201d and its implications for questions about representations in basic cognitive systems and the representational character of current empirical theories of cognition.",

      "abstract": "This article will take the following route to explore a reflective approach to the problem of mind and its possible contents. First, we will highlight the tension between psychology and semantics in order to explain the content of mental acts from a third-person perspective. We will examine how Kant's theory of apperception explored the conditions of objective representative expression to determine the content of the intentional acts of mind. Second, we will outline how Davidson's theory of interpretation, using an extensional semantic theory based on Tarski, explores the underdeterminacy of compatible interpretive hypotheses in order to arrive at a collectively-sensitive conception of the mutual understanding and internal content of beliefs. Kant and Davidson agree that the conditions for understanding mental (or intentional) content depend on a theory of truth (or judgement) that provides the non-unilateral parameter for interpreting that content. We will then observe how this perspective accommodates skeptical notions of mind, content, and intention. We conclude with a series of remarks on the methodological tensions within psychology, showing that psychology and phenomenology face skepticism and possible absorption by sociologically infused conditions of study. The problem is that the study of the intentionality and content of mental beliefs can dissolve its object \u2013 the mind and consciousness \u2013 into a kind of ghost behind language or a mere reification of the normative conditions of rational behavior under the conditions of language influence.",

The article criticizes the traditional conception of consciousness, in which cognition is considered as an interface between perception and action, without taking into account interrelation of these processes. The problem of mental content is tackled; it is shown that normativity of non-conceptual mental content is weaker in comparison with conceptual one. Scientific originality of the study lies in the fact that the researcher introduces the name of the woman-philosopher S. Hurley, a figure of the English-language cognitive philosophy whose works are little known in Russia, into scientific use. The author clarifies the notion \u201cmental content\u201d and criticizes the modern cognitive theory. The research findings are as follows: correlation of non-conceptual mental content and action intention is revealed, the notion \u201cmental content\u201d is analysed in relation to pre-linguistic consciousness.",
