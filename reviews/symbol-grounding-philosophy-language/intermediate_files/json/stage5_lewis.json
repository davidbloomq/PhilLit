      "abstract": "This chapter is one of three that draws out the consequences of Radical Interpretation for how concepts represent the world. A claim associated with David Lewis is that metaphysically fundamental properties are \u2018reference magnets\u2019\u2014that if usage is equipoised between two candidate referents, the one that is \u2018closer to the metaphysical fundamentals\u2019 is the one that gets to be the referent. This chapter examines how such a thesis might arise as a prediction of Radical Interpretation. It looks to epistemology of inference to the best explanation to make a connection between concepts used in explanations and naturalness. The connection to concepts used in induction is discussed.",

      "abstract": "According to the eligibility theory of meaning, often attributed to David Lewis, the referent of a predicate is the property that best balances the twin constraints of charity (i.e. fit with our usage of the term) and eligibility, where eligibility is a function of metaphysical naturalness (i.e. how much of a natural kind the property is). This sort of metasemantics, which is motivated by its ability to resolve problems of indeterminacy and secure shared reference between disputing parties, can be somewhat friendly towards revisionary (i.e. counterintuitive) theories, since highly natural properties can act as \u201creference magnets,\u201d securing our reference despite some mismatch with usage. In this paper, I apply these considerations to normative ethics and argue that the theory of rule utilitarianism achieves a high balance of charity and eligibility. I proceed by comparing rule utilitarianism to two of its well-known rivals, act utilitarianism and Rossian pluralism (a.k.a. \u201cCommonsense Morality\u201d). I show how the former achieves a high degree of eligibility but only at a significant cost of charity, while the latter does the opposite, fitting very nicely with our considered judgments but at the price of very low eligibility. Rule utilitarianism, on the other hand, strikes a good balance between these extremes; it assigns to our core moral term (\u2018moral permissibility\u2019) a relatively natural property without doing too much damage to our moral convictions. Thus, rule utilitarianism should be regarded as a promising moral theory by any philosopher who takes seriously considerations of eligibility and naturalness.",

Lewis, despite their differences and their different receptions, came to a common intellectual destination: epistemological structuralism. The chapter begins by providing an account of Quine\u2019s epistemological structuralism as it came to its mature development in his final works, Pursuit of Truth (1990) and From Stimulus to Science (1995), and the chapter shows how this doctrine developed out of his earlier views on explication and the inscrutability of reference. It then turns to the correspondence between Quine and Lewis which sets the scene for Lewis\u2019s adoption of structuralism vis-\u00e0-vis set theory in the Appendix to his Parts of Classes (1990). The chapter concludes, drawing further from Lewis\u2019s correspondence, by arguing that Lewis proceeded from there to embrace in one of his own final papers, \u2018Ramseyan Humility\u2019 (2001), an encompassing form of epistemological structuralism, whilst discharging the doctrine of reference magnetism that had hitherto set Lewis apart from Quine.",

The main topics under discussion come from major areas of analytic philosophy: metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, language, and ethics. Specifically, the chapters discuss the metaphysics and epistemology of modality, the status of grounding, the significance of Humean supervenience, the role of conceptual analysis, naturalness and properties, semantics, the history of the counterfactual theory of causation, Lewis\u2019s views in ethics, and his account of time travel. The authors draw from Lewis\u2019s recently published correspondence to support their interpretation of his philosophy and his place in the history of analytic philosophy. This volume will expand on scholarship on Lewis and further his influence on current debates.",

      "abstract": "The Targhee breed is important to range sheep production in the Western United States. The objective of this research was to integrate industry sires participating in national genetic evaluation through the National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP) into the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station (USSES) flock, where the breed originated, to benchmark sire performance. Estimated breeding values (EBV) of industry sires (n = 16) and USSES sires (n = 12) from the 2023 NSIP Targhee genetic evaluation differed (P < 0.05) only for the NSIP Number Born EBV. This difference, and small (nonsignificant) differences favoring industry sires for maternal weaning weight, yearling fiber diameter, and yearling staple length EBV also resulted in greater (P < 0.05) Western Range Index scores for industry sires. The performance of sires' direct progeny born 2016 to 2018 was compared for 17 traits. After data cleaning, there were 664 progeny (417 from industry sires and 247 from USSES sires) with 146 to 664 records per trait. Least squares means differed (P\u2005<\u20050.05) for grease fleece weight, side fiber diameter, and britch fiber diameter in favor of the industry sires. Production traits were measured from the progeny and other retained descendants of both sire genetic groups from 2016 through 2022. After data cleaning, there was a range of 1,138 to 1,493 records per trait. A three-generation pedigree was constructed and the proportional assignment of each lamb to each genetic group (e.g., 0.5 industry, 0.5 USSES) was included in an augmented relationship matrix. A univariate animal model was fitted for each lamb trait and a repeated measures model for each of the three ewe traits was fitted to estimate variance components and predict breeding values. Genetic group solutions did not differ (P\u2005>\u20050.05) for any of these traits but provided a means by which to compare the two groups. Establishment of a Targhee genetic reference flock at USSES has been initiated, which can be used to address issues of importance to the industry.",

      "abstract": "Genome-wide data is used to stratify patients into classes for precision medicine using clustering algorithms. A common problem in this area is selection of the number of clusters (K). The Monti consensus clustering algorithm is a widely used method which uses stability selection to estimate K. However, the method has bias towards higher values of K and yields high numbers of false positives. As a solution, we developed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C), which is based on this algorithm. M3C simulates null distributions of stability scores for a range of K values thus enabling a comparison with real data to remove bias and statistically test for the presence of structure. M3C corrects the inherent bias of consensus clustering as demonstrated on simulated and real expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For testing M3C, we developed clusterlab, a new method for simulating multivariate Gaussian clusters.",

      "abstract": "Many writers have held that in his later work, David Lewis adopted a theory of predicate meaning such that the meaning of a predicate is the most natural property that is (mostly) consistent with the way the predicate is used. That orthodox interpretation is shared by both supporters and critics of Lewis's theory of meaning, but it has recently been strongly criticised by Wolfgang Schwarz. In this paper, I accept many of Schwarze's criticisms of the orthodox interpretation, and add some more. But I also argue that the orthodox interpretation has a grain of truth in it, and seeing that helps us appreciate the strength of Lewis's late theory of meaning. References T. Bays.

Vibrant water colour illustrations of fungi covered the pages bound within it. It was attributed to Lewis David von Schweinitz, the American born \u201cfather\u201d of North American mycology. Schweinitz coauthored his first mycological publication with Johannes Baptista von Albertini in Germany, 1805: Conspectus fungorum in Lusatiae superioris agro Nieskiensi crescentium (An overview of fungi growing in the area of Niesky in Upper Lusatia), now considered a classic mycological text. Schweinitz, a prolific and skillful mycological illustrator, prepared the plates of illustrations appended to the Conspectus and produced many unpublished water colours of the fungi treated therein. The results of our research into the provenance of the Icones fungorum Niskiensium are presented here. Building upon recent scholarship, we provide analysis of its role in the early development of the Conspectus. An index to the figures, cross-referenced to Schweinitz\u2019s other unpublished volumes of water colours and to the Conspectus, is also provided. To make the Icones fungorum Niskiensium publically available, the volume has been digitized and may be accessed through the Biodiversity Hertitage Library (BHL) portal.",

Study design Blinded, certified examiners in the Neonatal Research Network (NRN) evaluated EP survivors and a sample of healthy TR infants recruited near the 2-year assessment age. Results We assessed 1452 EP infants and 183 TR infants. TR-based thresholds showed higher overall EP impairment than Bayley norm-based thresholds (O.R. = 1.86; [95% CI 1.56\u20132.23], especially for severe impairment (36% vs. 24%; p \u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Difficulty recruiting TR patients at 2 years extended the study by 14 months and affected their demographics. Conclusion Impairment rates among EP infants appear to be substantially underestimated from Bayley III norms. These rates may be best assessed by comparison with healthy term infants followed with minimal attrition from birth in the same centers.

      "abstract": "The criterion of naturalness represents David Lewis\u2019s attempt to answer some of the sceptical arguments in (meta-) semantics by comparing the naturalness of meaning candidates. Recently, the criterion has been challenged by a new sceptical argument. Williams argues that the criterion cannot rule out the candidates which are not permuted versions of an intended interpretation. He presents such a candidate \uf6de the arithmetical interpretation (a specific instantiation of Henkin\u2019s model), and he argues that it opens up the possibility of Pythagorean worlds, i.e. the worlds similar to ours in which the arithmetical interpretation is the best candidate for a semantic theory. The aim of this paper is a) to reconsider the general conditions for the applicability of Lewis\u2019s criterion of naturalness and b) to show that Williams\u2019s new sceptical challenge is based on a problematic assumption that the arithmetical interpretation is independent of fundamental properties and relations. As I show, if the criterion of naturalness is applied properly, it can respond even to the new sceptical challenge.",

      "abstract": "The P2X purinergic receptor 7 (P2X7) has an essential role in inflammation, innate immunity, tumor progression, neurodegenerative diseases, and several other diseases, leading subsequently to the development of P2X7 modulators. AZ11645373 is a frequently studied P2X7 antagonist tool compound but always used as a racemic mixture. Racemic AZ11645373 can be separated into its respective enantiomers by chiral chromatography, albeit in small batches, and these were stereochemically intact over two years later, by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. On a higher scale, significant decomposition is observed during purification. One of the enantiomers was crystallized as a palladium complex, and its (R)-configuration was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, further confirmed, in solution, by vibrational circular dichroism. Biological studies demonstrated that both (S)- and (R)-forms were able to fully inhibit human P2X7, but (R)-AZ11645373 was more potent, with an IC50 of 32.9 nM. Contrary to its effect on human P2X7, (S)-AZ11645373 was ineffective on mouse P2X7, while the (R)-AZ11645373 enantiomer was a full antagonist. These results demonstrated that the antagonistic effects of racemic AZ11645373 are mainly due to its (R)-enantiomer. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the (R)-enantiomer may form specific interactions with Phe95 and the antagonists bound to other P2X7 monomers. Phe95 is situated in the allosteric binding site at the edge of the upper vestibule and appears to be the pivotal molecular gateway between AZ11645373 allosteric binding and locking of the closed state of the P2X7 channel. All together, these structure-function relationships should be helpful for drug design of P2X7 modulators.",

While how and whether McDowell\u2019s ideas are really more than an echo of the insights within the activity-theoretical framework might be up for debate, I end by briefly considering the ways that McDowell\u2019s philosophy enriches socio-historical research with reference to two ongoing attempts: what David Bakhurst calls McDowell\u2019s \u201ctransformational view\u201d of human development and learning and David Macarthur\u2019s project of McDowellian \u201cliberal naturalism.\u201d",
