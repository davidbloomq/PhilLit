      "abstract": "This paper continues the defense of a version of scientific realism, Tautological Scientific Realism (TSR), that rests on the claim that, excluding some areas of fundamental physics about which doubts are entirely justified, many areas of contemporary science cannot be coherently imagined to be false other than via postulation of radically skeptical scenarios, which are not relevant to the realism debate in philosophy of science. In this paper we discuss, specifically, the threats of meaning change and reference failure associated with the Kuhnian tradition, which depend on a descriptivist approach to meaning, and we argue that descriptivism is not the right account of the meaning and reference of theoretical terms. We suggest that an account along the lines of the causal-historical theory of reference provides a more faithful picture of how terms for unobservable theoretical entities and properties come to refer; we argue that this picture works particularly well for TSR. In the last section we discuss how our account raises concerns specifically for perspectival forms of SR.",

Cognition 92, B1-B12 (2004) attacked Kripke\u2019s refutation of classical descriptivism, their experiment has been repeated several times, in its original version or in some revised ones, by theorists with contrasting intents. Some repeated the experiment for confirming its results, others for proving them unreliable. One striking characteristic of those surveys is that they mostly replicated the data collected in Machery et al.\u2019s Cognition 92, B1-B12, 2004 experiment: less than 60% of Westerners showed preference for the causal-historical response. We side with the critics of Machery et al.\u2019s experiment. In this paper, we present the results of a survey that tests some hypotheses for explaining that percentage of Westerners\u2019 preferences without taking it as evidence that more than 40% of Westerners have descriptivist intuitions on semantic reference. The aim of our paper is not merely to question the reliability of Machery et al.\u2019s experiment. In sections 4 and 5 we assess the impact of our survey on the current debate in experimental semantics. We provide a novel account of the nature of the epistemic ambiguity that affects experiments in theory of reference and explain the consequences that our account of the epistemic ambiguity has for subsequent works trying to avoid ambiguities.",

This is the view that semantic reference is conventionalized speakers reference , i.e. the view that a name semantically refers to an object if, and only if, there exists a convention to use the name to speaker-refer to that object. The theory can be found in works dealing primarily with other issues (e.g. Stine in Philos Stud 33:319\u2013337, 1977; Schiffer in Erkenntnis 13:171\u2013206, 1978; Sainsbury in Erkenntnis 80:195\u2013214, 2015; Sainsbury, Thinking about things , Oxford University Press, 2018), yet these authors provide no sustained discussion of it. Devitt ( Designation , Columbia University Press, 1981) did formulate a view on which semantic reference is conventionalized speaker\u2019s reference, yet his views are assimilated to causalist views. This is a mistake. While the conventionalized speaker\u2019s reference view captures much of what is plausible in descriptivism and causalism, it remains distinct from both.",

Under the causal theory, the idea that reference is a function of one's epistemic connection to a referent has been replaced by the idea that reference is a function of one's metaphysical connection to a referent. Viewing reference as a metaphysical rather than an epistemic affair guarantees an externalist view of reference, and to the extent that reference is what individualism is about, it constitutes a refutation of individualism. Whenever a new word is coined, whether its reference is fixed by ostention or by description, the coiner is always, however implicitly, investing the word with sortal commitments.",

Faced with this problem, hybrid theories of reference have been developed. They combine features of both descriptivism and the causal theory and seek to capture the advantages of each. In this work, we critically analyze two strategies to articulate hybrid theories of reference in the face of the problem of the meaning of theoretical terms. They are exemplified by the proposals of Psillos and Kitcher. We argue that neither of these strategies is successful in articulating the descriptive and causal elements in a genuine hybrid theory of reference that satisfies the standards of scientific realism.",

      "abstract": "Descriptivism is a theory which attempts to explain why proper names designate objects and why people can refer to objects, using names. Its roots lie in classical Fregean understanding of what constitutes the meaning of a proper name. According to Frege, every proper name is associated with the way in which it presents the object it designates and this way of presentation is a way how the object can be determined. One of the important conclusions that could be drawn from Kripke\u2019s Naming and Necessity is the opportunity to change our understanding of the notion of meaning and separate a condition of a reference identification from a speaker\u2019s knowledge. The causal descriptivism is a version of non-classical descriptive theory of reference-fixing in which the descriptive condition only secures the name\u2019s referent\u2014there is no requirement that this condition should be known by speakers.",

The alternative of conceptualism versus essentialism about the reference of general terms is explained in details. The case is made that most of the intuitions on which Kripke based his arguments are highly controversial, and the main examples he used to explain and support his views (such as examples of whales and fish, water and H20, gold, tigers, and unicorns) do not constitute a clear case for the preference of essentialism over conceptualism. Moreover, these examples can be modified in such ways that in the perspective of these modifications, Kripke\u2019s essentialist construal turns out to be far-fetched and implausible, whereas a form of conceptualism (the cluster theory of reference) is tenable.",

This paper (1) reviews 11 theories that have served the majority of previous information security behavior models, (2) empirically compares these theories (Study 1), (3) proposes a unified model, called the unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC), which integrates elements across these extant theories, and (4) empirically tests the UMISPC in a new study (Study 2), which provided preliminary empirical support for the model. The 11 theories reviewed are (1) the theory of reasoned action, (2) neutrali- zation techniques, (3) the health belief model, (4) the theory of planned behavior, (5) the theory of interpersonal behavior, (6) the protection motivation theory, (7) the extended protection motivation theory, (8) deterrence theory and rational choice theory, (9) the theory of self-regulation, (10) the extended parallel processing model, and (11) the control balance theory. The UMISPC is an initial step toward empirically examining the extent to which the existing models have similar and different constructs. Future research is needed to examine to what extent the UMISPC can explain different types of ISS behaviors (or intentions thereof). Such studies will determine the extent to which the UMISPC needs to be revised to account for different types of ISS policy violations and the extent to which the UMISPC is generalizable beyond the three types of ISS violations we examined. Finally, the UMISPC is intended to inspire future ISS research to further theorize and empirically demonstrate the important differences between rival theories in the ISS context that are not captured by current measures.",

      "abstract": "In \"Putnam's Paradox\", David Lewis defended the \"realist philosophy we know and love\" against Hilary Putnam's \"bomb\", an argument that a realist must count practically any consistent theory as being true. Many of us thought that Lewis defused that bomb with his \"reference magnetism\" (and many more would have, had that doctrine been properly understood1). But Shamik Dasgupta (2018) has devised a new bomb. Not only would it demolish Lewis's response to Putnam, but worse, its blast radius would also include all realist metaphysics based on notions of natural property, fundamentality, ground, causation, lawhood, and the like. Dasgupta must be stopped!2 Natural properties played a central and pervasive role in Lewis's metaphysical thought from the early 80s onward. Natural properties \"carve at the joints\", he said; they \"ground the objective resemblances and the causal powers of things\" (1983, p. 345). They are the fundamental properties, and as such are few in number: \"there are only just enough of them to characterize things completely and without redundancy\" (1986, p. 60). Most properties, such as familiar properties of common sense, and certainly properties like Nelson Goodman's (1955b) grue and bleen, are not natural. (Not perfectly natural, anyway; Lewis allowed naturalness to come in degrees.) Lewis used natural properties to define intrinsicality, materialism, and laws of nature, and in general appealed to them throughout his work. \"As I bear [realism about natural properties] in mind considering various topics in philosophy\", he said, \"I notice time and again that it offers solutions to my problems\" (1983, p. 343). And they were the basis of his response to Putnam. Putnam's argument (as interpreted by Lewis3) presupposed a \"pure descriptivist\" view of reference. What determines what our names and predicates refer to? According to the pure descriptivist, we do, by putting forward a certain set of sentences, a \"term-introducing theory\", intending to constrain the meanings of the nonlogical constants therein. An intended interpretation of our language, according to this view, is nothing more than an assignment of worldly objects and sets of tuples of worldly objects to those nonlogical constants that makes every sentence of the term-introducing theory come out true.4 The descriptivist's constraints on reference are holistic: the referents of sub-sentential expressions are constrained only by the requirement that certain entire sentences containing those terms come out true. Thus intuitively bizarre assignments of reference are possible, since they can be offset by other bizarre assignments. For example, \"All cows are mammals\" can be true under an assignment in which 'cow' refers to the set of jelly beans, if 'mammal' is assigned a set that contains all jelly beans. If this perverse assignment of reference is carefully extended so that all sentences in the term-introducing theory come out true, it will count as an intended interpretation. Truth is cheap, given this conception of reference: pretty much no matter what the world is like, any theory whatsoever is guaranteed to turn out true on some intended interpretation, provided only that it is consistent with the term-introducing theory. Suppose some theory, S, is consistent with the term-introducing theory T in the model-theoretic sense that T + S has a model in set theory. If the world contains sufficiently many entities (in a sense that can be made precise) then it will contain an isomorphic image of the model, which will be an assignment of worldly referents to the nonlogical constants under which every sentence of T + S is true. Given pure descriptivism, this assignment counts as an intended interpretation. Thus given very weak assumptions (consistency with T, sufficiently many worldly objects), any theory S is bound to be true under some intended interpretation, no matter what it says and no matter what the world is like. No realist can accept this. What appeared so powerful about Putnam's argument was its built-in resistance to counter-attack. Whenever an objector proposed some further constraint on reference, such as \"a word must be appropriately causally related to its referent\", Putnam could always reply: \"that's just more theory!\" That is, the proposed further constraint would consist of further sentences to add to the term-introducing theory. But that wouldn't threaten the argument at all: provided the enlarged term-introducing theory remains consistent with S, the argument could proceed as before. Lewis's response was that an intended interpretation must do more than merely assign referents under which the term-introducing theory comes out true. An intended interpretation must, in addition, assign natural properties as referents of the predicates. To the objection that this is \"just more theory\" and hence does not solve the problem, Lewis's reply was that this misunderstands his proposal. His proposal is not to accept a pure descriptivist theory of reference and include the sentence 'intended interpretations must assign natural properties' in the term-introducing theory (which would indeed be just more theory). It is rather to deny the pure descriptivist view of reference. Putnam simply assumes that a view of reference must take that form; and the assumption is unjustified. Lewis's alternative is a mixed descriptivist view of reference: an intended interpretation must, in addition to rendering the sentences of the term-introducing theory true, also assign natural properties as referents.5 We might ask Lewis: why must referents be natural properties? Now, it is clear that Lewis's approach to reference is intended as a constitutive account. So Lewis might reply that it is just part of the nature of reference that reference is to natural properties. This is what reference is. But that simply pushes the question back. For we can introduce a notion of shmatural properties, which are \"gruified\" versions of natural properties, and a notion of shmeference, which stands to shmatural properties in the way that reference stands, according to Lewis, to natural properties. Just as it is part of the nature of reference that we refer to natural properties, it is also part of the nature of shmeference that we shmefer to shmatural properties, properties such as grue and bleen. Lewis's claim that reference is to natural properties might now begin to seem thin. For it is also true that shmeference is to shmatural properties. What is so special about reference? Dasgupta's new bomb is based on a similar line of thought. I will consider it as deployed against realism about natural properties, although it is just as effective against related targets such as realism about ground, fundamentality, causation, or laws of nature. Realism about natural properties, Dasgupta argues, must be paired with certain value judgments about naturalness. We do a better job of representing the world if we think and speak of natural properties rather than shmatural properties, even holding fixed the extent to which we think and speak the truth; it is more rational to project natural properties than shmatural ones when doing induction; science ought to aim for generalizations involving natural rather than shmatural properties; reference is more important than shmeference; and so on. For short: our theorizing should be centered on naturalness. Otherwise why all the fuss about naturalness? Further, the realist must take these value judgments to be objective. It perhaps goes without saying that Lewis took his division between natural and unnatural properties to be an objective one, rather than deriving from some fact about human interests, culture, biology, or history. But according to Dasgupta, the realist is committed to thinking additionally that the value of naturalness, and not just naturalness itself, is objective. For if, as Goodman (1955c, chapter IV) thought, we ought to project green rather than grue simply because only the former is entrenched in our usage, the intuitive core of realism has been lost. But, Dasgupta asks, what could explain this epistemic value of naturalness? It does need an explanation: since naturalness is a purely metaphysical status, some substantive connection between it and epistemic value must be forged. Dasgupta himself is happy with anthropocentric explanations (for instance, Goodman's), but the realist cannot accept any such explanation since that would compromise the objectivity of the value of naturalness. And, Dasgupta says, no other acceptable explanation is available. This argument does not directly attack the metaphysics of natural properties itself, only the claim that theorizing ought to be centered on natural properties. But I agree with Dasgupta that realism about natural properties needs realism about their value.6 Jonathan Schaffer has pressed a certain line of response to Dasgupta, which is roughly that introducing what we might call \"shmamiked\" versions of concepts such as shmaturalness and shmeference is changing the subject. This line can be taken at various places in the dialectic. I am going to consider one such place, and a particularly simple form of the line. But Schaffer himself would not take the line at this place, or in this form, so I will speak of what a \"Schafferian\", rather than Schaffer himself, might say.7 Which generalizations should scientists aim for? Let us suppose this realist answer: generalizations that are simple when phrased in terms of natural properties. For short: science should aim for laws.8 (Rather than shmlaws\u2014simple generalizations in terms of shmatural properties.) Dasgupta now demands an explanation for the proposed fact about epistemic value. Here is the Schafferian reply: it's part of what I mean by 'should' that science should aim for laws.9 You are free to make this stipulation; you are master of your words. But relations are cheap. There is another relation between scientists and propositions, the shmould-aim-for relation, which scientists bear to shmlaws. Someone else could stipulate that 'should aim for' means that relation instead. Who cares what scientists shmould aim for? The question we were asking is what they should aim for, and why; and I have answered that question. Your response, bringing in what scientists shmould aim for, simply changes the subject. It is no more pertinent than the response: \"Oh yeah? Well, six out of every ten scientists prefer bubble gum to lollipops\". \"Relations are cheap\" is an indirect dialectical challenge. It never meets a realist's claim of the form \"X has value Y because Z\" head-on. Rather, it introduces some further sort of value, \u2014a shmamiked form of Y\u2014which is had, not by X, but by the shmamiked ; and is had by because of some shmamiked . The shmamiked fact that (and not X) has value because , is not incompatible with the realist's claim that X (and not ) has value Y because Z\u2014not straightforwardly so, anyway. The Schafferian response consists of emphasis of this, together with indifference to the shmamiked fact. (Although I have given the Schafferian response a linguistic spin, a more robustly metaphysical version could be given: it is part of the essence or nature of the relation should-aim-for that scientists should aim for laws. This would not change the dialectical situation. Provided that there is a sufficiently abundant range of relations, individuated by their essences, Dasgupta will respond that in addition to the relation should-aim-for, there is also a relation of shmould-aim-for with a different essential profile: it is part of its essence that we shmould aim for shmlaws. And the Schafferian will claim that the existence of this other relation is irrelevant.10) The Schafferian response is important because, in my view, any responder to Dasgupta is going to need to adopt its strategy at some point in the dialectic, and insist that the shmamiked fact is irrelevant. But I don't think we're at that point yet, since a case can be made that the shmamiked fact is relevant here. It is relevant because it appears to undermine the objectivity of the value claim that scientists ought to aim for laws. Dasgupta himself, remember, does not deny that theorizing ought to be centered on naturalness. He grants this value claim, but his explanation of it is an anthropocentric one. The realist, he says, cannot accept this explanation, but rather must find some explanation of the value of naturalness that secures its objectivity. And objectivity does indeed seemed to be threatened by the shmamiked counterpart to the Schafferian explanation. For the truth of the sentence 'Scientists ought to aim for laws' now appears to turn on an arbitrary stipulation, an arbitrary choice to mean a relation defined in terms of naturalness (or: with naturalness built into its essence) rather than one defined in terms of shmaturalness. (Of course, since meaning is conventional, there is some arbitrariness in every choice of what to mean. We will return to this.) Compare Strawson's (1952, chapter 9, section 2) solution to the problem of induction: the reasonableness of induction is part of what we mean by 'reasonable'. This strikes many as unsatisfying; and underlying this suspicion is, I think, a concern about objectivity.11 For consider a society of \"counter-inductivists\" who, upon observing more and more black ravens become increasingly convinced that the next raven will not be black. (Their past history of inductive failures does not dampen their enthusiasm: the more they fail, the more convinced they become that they will succeed the next time.) These counter-inductivists might say something parallel to Strawson: it is part of what they mean by 'reasonable' that counter-induction is reasonable. In light of the counter-inductivists, it is difficult to maintain one's belief in the objectivity of the reasonableness of induction if we can say nothing more than Strawson did in its favor. But what notion of objectivity is at work here? Answering will not only explain why \"relations are cheap\" works when it does, but will also show that it does not always work. On some conceptions of objectivity, the objectivity of the Schafferian's value claim is not threatened by the shmamiked alternate meaning for 'should'. For instance, the proposition that the Schafferian in fact expresses with the sentence 'Scientists should aim for laws' is not mind-dependent, in any relevant sense, alternate meanings nonwithstanding. Even if scientific practice had been very different\u2014even if, for example, some \"Schmafferian\" and her cabal had taken over the centers of scientific power and encouraged the pursuit of shmlaws, imposing in Orwellian fashion shmould as the meaning of 'should'\u2014it would still have been the case that scientists should have pursued laws. For when evaluating what scientists in counterfactual scenarios should have done, we employ our actual meaning of 'should'. On the Schafferian proposal under discussion, that meaning is the relation holding between scientists and the proposition is a about natural properties. That relation makes no reference to scientific it between the scientists and laws in the course, that relation would not then have been by but that is if we had by would still have had But in my view, conceptions of objectivity in terms of are for example, of a over what counts as a certain sort of in will of many of made of green in a p. on the other will not this as being a There is a clear sense in which it is not an objective matter are to count as like an arbitrary rather than a matter for there might be a fact of the matter are linguistic would as a under the for means in a If so, then can the is a it would still have been a even if we had all as the more just as would still have had if we had by Thus the fact that the is a is in the relevant sentence are would have been but that is to as it is We should not from this that it is objective all are We a more conception of objectivity. In my view, this more conception must be To my that S is we must not consider the proposition that is, the proposition that I with it would have been true in various counterfactual We should to the sentence and certain alternate meanings it could have If the truth value of the sentence under one of those meanings from its actual truth value, the sentence to be objective. The of objectivity in the question about is in the instance, about the proposition that are it in the sentence are and the range of meanings we could have assigned to we assigned a true proposition to that we could have assigned it a one. This needs to be in a of I do this chapter are the since all is conventional, any sentence could have been used to a proposition with a different truth this does not mean that no sentences are objective. In my not all count as meanings for a given and in the objectivity of a we do not consider all the alternate meanings the sentence could have had, only the In for a meaning to count as a meaning for some it must be that a linguistic that assigned that meaning to the would not be the must still be used to do the as it would not have the core role of the meaning to that would a over there is any on further that there is indeed but only one of and consider an alternate meaning for that is just like that the of on is from its in the actual Now, the fact that the sentence is on is under this alternate that sentence is true. Thus the meaning must be from under the of objectivity. But its is different in from the of as a meaning for The properties and only in in the actual world (and not at all in other and so a society that such a society is even would not from our in the way that a society that by does count as a meaning for is not by to be a but because it is such an unnatural it so to nature at its of objectivity according to the when a sentence would have had a different truth value under some meaning that is as natural as its actual The intuitive of the is simply that to objectivity. we have enough to some of we can then ask about that and objective only when do not some such do not some such for in that we do to our interests, or arbitrary rather than the of This conception of objectivity is, I an important one. In many central in which objectivity is the of objectivity is to its is not a matter of the proposition at but is rather to the of our linguistic practice to out a meaning for some Let us return to Strawson's solution to the problem of concern about objectivity can now be the existence of the meaning for 'reasonable' is, given the a to the objectivity of is in Strawson's To that a response than Strawson's is We need an of the role of 'reasonable' that that the meaning would not that or else a to think that it at the than the That meaning must be on it to the Here we need further for the alternate meaning the fact that it For if that relation could have been by in our about the of science without the core of that and if it at the as as our then the sentence 'Scientists ought to aim for laws' will to be the of the proposition we in fact with that The is I can now Dasgupta's for an explanation of the value of naturalness.

In fact I am not in a to do since I do not have a sufficiently out metaphysics of epistemic value to I can I will make a certain assumption about the of this relation out to and show Dasgupta can be answered under that The assumption is that the of the relation makes reference to natural properties or To consider the of an that the According to this the of the to aim for laws is an the fact that we are in an an in which this aim to an in which there in many is, many true simple generalizations in terms of natural properties.

We are to aim for laws because what it is to be to aim for a proposition is to bear the relation to that and we do in fact bear that relation to Your explanation of the value of for simple generalizations in terms of natural properties is, in that many such generalizations are true. For we in a world that is But relations are cheap. We can define a notion of that of a world in which there are many simple in terms of shmatural properties; and we can define a notion of under which we to aim for of a sort that to be true in our world is we to aim for shmlaws. The proposal to the objectivity. This response is its We can indeed define the notions of and But the existence of these notions do not threaten the objectivity of involving their because they are natural than their and more the sentence objectivity is under 'Scientists ought to aim for The is that although this sentence is true when has its actual the relation , it is when has a certain alternate the relation . But given the objectivity is only if this relation is a meaning for and also is as natural as the actual And the requirement is not since the shmamiked properties and relations are so much natural than the properties and relations is much natural than . Thus the existence of the alternate meaning does not undermine the objectivity of the value of for the just as the existence of does not undermine the objectivity of the existence of on We can now why Dasgupta's argument was so it was properly Dasgupta's \"relations are cheap\" like an just as Putnam's \"just more theory\" To any proposed explanation of the value of naturalness, Dasgupta can always a shmamiked and the existence of the counterpart is because it to threaten the objectivity of the value. more theory\" its Lewis out its it works only if pure is \"Relations are cheap\" also has which become we properly the notion of objectivity.

      "abstract": "\u2018Moral Twin Earth\u2019 thought experiments constitute a central semantic challenge to naturalistic normative realism. This paper first outlines a general framework for understanding the challenge, according to which (i) central normative terms are semantically stable in ways that contrast with many other paradigmatic descriptive terms, and (ii) realists should expect to have a unified meta-semantic theory that explains the difference in stability between the normative and descriptive terms in question. The most attractive way of meeting this challenge, we argue, appeals to the idea of reference magnetism. According to this influential idea, some properties are reference magnets, which (roughly) means that they are comparatively easy to refer to. We argue that (together with other plausible assumptions) reference magnetism can provide an attractive explanation of both the general phenomenon of varying semantic stability, and the distinctive semantic stability of normative terms. We illustrate this by showing that reference magnetism can smoothly vindicate plausible judgments about Moral Twin Earth cases. We conclude by offering an alternative gloss on our account, for those wary of the metaphysical commitments we propose. The alternative account adapts our proposal to provide a debunking explanation of the apparent semantic stability of normative terms.",

Answering these questions is of central importance for implementing and theorizing about conceptual engineering. This paper discusses and criticizes two influential views of this issue: semanticism , according to which conceptual engineers aim to change linguistic meanings, and psychologism , according to which conceptual engineers aim to change psychological structures. I argue that neither of these accounts can give us the full story. Instead, I propose and defend the Dual Content View of Conceptual Engineering . On this view, conceptual engineering targets concepts, where concepts are understood as having two (interrelated) kinds of contents: referential content and cognitive content. I show that this view is independently plausible and that it gives us a comprehensive account of conceptual engineering that helps to make progress on some of the most difficult problems surrounding conceptual engineering.",

Naturalists think that they are ordinary natural properties: causally efficacious, a posteriori knowable, and usable in the best explanations of natural and social sciences. Non-naturalist realists, in contrast, argue that they are sui generis: causally inert, a priori knowable and not a part of the subject matter of sciences. It has been assumed so far that naturalists can explain causally how the normative predicates manage to refer to normative properties, whereas non-naturalists are unable to provide equally satisfactory metasemantic explanations. This article first describes how the previous non-naturalist accounts of reference fail to tell us how the normative predicates could have come to refer to the non-natural properties rather than to the natural ones. I will then use the so-called qua-problem to show how the causal theories of reference of naturalists also fail to fix the reference of normative predicates to unique natural properties. Finally, I will suggest that, just as naturalists need to rely on the non-causal mechanism of reference magnetism to solve the previous problem, non-naturalists, too, can rely on the very same idea to respond to the pressing metasemantic challenges that they face concerning reference.",

And: If Islam were true and Christianity false, might \"God\" still refer to Allah?We explain the implications of your answers to those questions, and we close with a few reflections about what, in addition to reference, might be required for worship, and whether, from a Christian perspective, salvation turns on this issue.We call Beckwith's reasoning \"The Argument from Monotheism,\" and we believe it goes like so:1.

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the most discussed issues in psychology\u2014presently and in the past\u2014is how to define and measure the extent to which human cognition is rational. The rationality of human cognition is often evaluated in terms of normative standards based on a priori intuitions. Yet this approach has been challenged by two recent developments in psychology that we review in this article: ecological rationality and descriptivism. Going beyond these contributions, we consider it a good moment for psychologists and philosophers to join forces and work toward a new foundation for the definition of rational cognition. We take a first step in this direction by proposing that the rationality of both cognitive and normative systems can be measured in terms of their cognitive success. Cognitive success can be defined and gauged in terms of two factors: ecological validity (the system's validity in conditions in which it is applicable) and the system's applicability (the scope of conditions under which it can be applied). As we show, prominent systems of reasoning\u2014deductive reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, uncertain conditionals, and prediction and choice\u2014perform rather differently on these two factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conceptualizing rationality according to its cognitive success offers a new perspective on the time\u2010honored relationship between the descriptive (\u201cis\u201d) and the normative (\u201cought\u201d) in psychology and philosophy.",

Although this claim is widely accepted, it remains unclear whether the mechanisms of visual reference have representational content or are directly instantiated in the functional architecture. I put forward a version of the former approach that construes object files as icons for objects. This view is consistent with the evidence that motivates the architectural account, can respond to the key arguments against representational accounts, and has explanatory advantages. I draw general lessons for the philosophy of perception and the naturalization of intentionality.",

It is argued that grounding semantic reference in cognition is contrary to the tenets that Kaplan himself contributed to establish in the revolution against descriptivism and internalism in semantics. It is argued also that the having in mind of an object is neither necessary nor sufficient for a use of a name to refer to its bearer. The criticisms lead to a reflection on the institution of naming and to a positive proposal: an externalist view, on which referring with uses of names requires that speakers join systematic, not necessarily social, linguistic practices.",
