Searle argued that the fact that machines can be devised to respond to input with the same output that a mind would give does not mean that mind and machine are doing the same thing: for the latter lacks understanding. Nineteen specially written essays by leading scientists and philosophers assess, renew, and respond to this crucial challenge\u2015fascinating reading for anyone interested in minds and computers.",

      "abstract": "I will be addressing 1 and not 2 or 3. I think 2 can be decisively answered in the negative. Since programs are defined purely formally or syntactically and since minds have an intrinsic mental content, it follows immediately that the program by itself cannot constitute the mind. The formal syntax of the program does not by itself guarantee the presence of mental contents. I showed this a decade ago in the Chinese Room Argument (Searle,1980). A computer, me for example, could run the steps in the program for some mental capacity, such as understanding Chinese, without understanding a word of Chinese. The argument rests on the simple logical truth that syntax is not the same as, nor is it by itself sufficient for, semantics. So the answer to the second question is obviously No.",

This paper is an attempt to sort out explicitly the assumptions and the logical, methodological and empirical points of disagreement. Searle is shown to have underestimated some features of computer modeling, but the heart of the issue turns out to be an empirical question about the scope and limits of the purely symbolic (computational) model of the mind. Nonsymbolic modeling turns out to be immune to the Chinese Room Argument. The issues discussed include the Total Turing Test, modularity, neural modeling, robotics, causality and the symbol-grounding problem.",

Its name originates from a thought experiment proposed by Searle in 1980 in the paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs.\" The debate has far exceeded the disciplinary boundaries of philosophy, and has had an impact especially in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In 1990, Searle proposed a new, closely related argument that did not catch as much attention but that is, according to Searle, deeper and more powerful than the original Chinese Room Argument.",

This systematic introduction to the full range of Searle's work begins with the theory of speech acts and proceeds with expositions of Searle's writings on intentionality, consciousness and perception, as well as a careful presentation of the so-called Chinese Room argument. The volume considers Searle's recent work on social ontology and his views on the nature of law and obligation. It concludes with an appraisal of Searle's spirited defence of truth and scientific method in the face of the criticisms of Derrida and other postmodernists. This is the only comprehensive introduction to Searle's work, and as such it will be of particular value to advanced undergraduates, graduates and professionals in philosophy, psychology, linguistics, cognitive and computer science and literary theory.",

In this article, I expand on the notion of symbol groundedness in three ways. Firstly, I show how a robot might select the best set of categories describing the world, given that fundamentally continuous sensory data can be categorised in an almost infinite number of ways. Secondly, I discuss the notion of grounded abstract (as opposed to concrete) concepts. Thirdly, I give an objective criterion for deciding when a robot&amp;apos;s symbols become sufficiently grounded for &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; to be attributed to it. This deeper analysis of what symbol groundedness actually is weakens Searle&amp;apos;s position in significant ways; in particular, whilst Searle may be able to refute Strong AI in the specific context of present-day digital computers, he cannot refute computationalism in general.1 Keywords: Chinese room argument, symbol grounding, artificial intelligence.",

His account of language based on speech-acts, that mind is intentional, and the Chinese Room Argument, are just some of his most famous contributions to philosophical thinking. In this \u0096 the first introduction to John Searle's philosophy \u0096 Nick Fotion provides clear and assured exposition of Searles' ideas, while also testing and exploring their implications. The book begins by examining Searle's work on the philosophy of language: his analysis of speech acts such as promising, his taxonomy of speech acts and the wider range of indirect speech acts and metaphorical uses of language. The book then moves on to cover the philosophy of mind and outlines Searle's ideas on international states. It introduces his notions of &quot;background&quot; and &quot;network&quot;, his claims for the often unrecognized importance of consciousness, and examines his attacks on other philosophical accounts of mind, such as materialism, functionalism and strong AI. The final section examines Searle's later work on the construction of social reality and concludes with more general reflections on Searle's position vis-\u00e0-vis ontology, epistemology, scepticism and the doctrine of &quot;external realism.&quot",

The philosophy of information. Oxford: Oxford University Press)] propose a solution to the symbol grounding problem (SGP). Unfortunately, their proposal, while certainly innovative, interesting and \u2013 given the acute difficulty of SGP \u2013 brave, merely shows that a class of robots can in theory connect, in some sense, the symbols it manipulates with the external world it perceives, and can, on the strength of that connection, communicate in sub-human fashion.Keywords:: symbol grounding problemrobotsAI AcknowledgementsI am indebted to Stevan Harnad for sustained and unforgettable discussions on both SGP and Searle's CRA, and to Luciano Floridi for teaching me enough about information to realise that SGP centres around the level of semantic information at the heart of CRA.Notes 1. Their article is reprinted in Floridi (Citation2011) [as Chapter 7; Chapter 6 is a sustained, stage-setting argument that other approaches fail to solve SGP (and is also derived directly from a journal article, namely Taddeo and Floridi (Citation2005))]. References herein are to the article itself. 2. In terms of the hierarchy of increasingly intelligent artificial agents introduced in Bringsjord, Noel, and Caporale (Citation2000), T&F point the way to synthetic creatures quite dim on the scale. For commentary on a scale specifically for communication, which allows that birds communicate pretty much at the level of the hide-and-feed robots that T&F are impressed by Bringsjord and Bringsjord (Citation1993) (see Section 3). 3. Rather long ago I pointed out that this expectation is folly (Bringsjord, Citation1992). 4. We read:Before defining the symbol grounding problem I will give two examples of it. The first comes from Searle's (Citation1980) celebrated 'Chinese Room Argument,' in which the symbol grounding problem is referred to as the problem of intrinsic meaning (or 'intentionality'): Searle challenges the core assumption of symbolic AI that a symbol system able to generate behavior indistinguishable from that of a person must have a mind. More specifically, according to the symbolic theory of mind, if a computer could pass the Turing Test (Turing, Citation1950) in Chinese \u2013 i.e. if it could respond to all Chinese symbol strings it receives as input with Chinese symbol strings that are indistinguishable from the replies a real Chinese speaker would make (even if we keep testing for a lifetime) \u2013then the computer would understand the meaning of Chinese symbols in the same sense that I understand the meaning of English symbols. (Harnad, Citation1990, p. 337) 5. I have here skipped to the version of CRA designed by Searle to counter the so-called 'Robot Reply' in Searle (Citation1980). My expansion and refinement of CRA in Bringsjord and Noel (Citation2002) is a (confessedly intricate) robot-reply version of the argument. 6. It would be easy enough to modify the example so that Allison's 'recommended' actions were more violent, and hence the consequences of Rob's misunderstanding in turn more severe. 7. We know that even problem-solving easier than that demanded by higher education requires understanding semantic content at the level of first-order logic; this is something e.g. Inhelder and Piaget (Citation1958) showed. Of course, in addition, my parable presupposes at least a quantified epistemic logic, but for purposes of evaluating T&F's proposed solution to SGP, there is nothing to be gained by considering the details of such a logic. Interested readers may wish to see e.g. Bringsjord and Govindarajulu (Citation2012). 8. There is by the way nothing to be gained by searching out the details of . All that is needed for my refutation is that subsumes a garden-variety truth-functional framework, such as the standard model-theoretic semantics of first-order logic. 9. Alert, critical readers will find the 'some fairly advanced' phrase ominously elastic, but I ignore this soon-to-be-the-crux issue for the moment.10. There are clearly some immediate consequences of the affirmation of the Z Condition. First, subscribers to the doctrine of innate semantic capacities are rather left out in the cold. (For what it is worth, this includes me, since I e.g. believe that 'background logic' \u2013treated elegantly and rigorously in Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas (Citation1994) \u2013 and facility with it is innate. For example, I hold that facility for using disjunctive syllogism is innate.) Second, subscribers to the doctrine that high-level semantic capacity at the level of neurobiologically normal human persons was indeed 'injected' into Homo sapiens sapiens by God are in the cold as well. (Hence, Darwin is warm; but the co-discoverer of evolution by mutation and natural selection, Wallace, a theist, is by the Z Condition freezing.) Third, thinkers who hold that 'Fodor's Paradox' (Fodor, Citation2008) for a recent presentation, see e.g. (sometimes called 'the paradox of learning') is not solvable by any move that fails to invoke either innatism or externalism are also automatically cast aside. (By the way, if T&F succeed in solving SGP under the constraint of the Z Condition, they have automatically also solved Fodor's Paradox!)11. Contributions to which have been made by Turing (Citation1950), who proclaimed that by the year 2000 the test that bears his name would be passed by computing machines, and who, in a brave but fideistic call for evolutionary approaches that would presumably resonate with T&F, saw little problem in setting down a machine in Cog-style and having it learn everything that otherwise engineers would painstakingly labour to figure out, and program in.12.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog(project); http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog_(project)13. And note that at worst you might be slightly unsure that Allison's was being sarcastic \u2013 in which case you would still genuinely understand the situation, and would not energetically set out withered flowers.",

      "abstract": "I will focus here on the following questions. (1) What constitutes the most fundamental kind of semantic content in thought and language, the kind of content sometimes called Original intentionality'? (2) Could suitably sophisticated robots be capable of original intentionality, solely by virtue of the functional roles played by their internal states vis-a-vis (i) other internal states, (ii) input and output states, and (iii) causal/historical connections linking such internal and bodily states to states of the external environment?1 (3) Could suitably sophisticated robots be capable of original intentionality in some other way? (4) How does Searle 's famous thought experiment bear upon questions (l)-(3)?In section 1, 1 will summarize recent work of mine in philosophy of mind - often collaborative with George Graham and/or John Tienson - that bears on question (l).2 The answer to this question that my collaborators and I favor and have elsewhere defended is this: original intentionality is what we call phenomenal intentionality. Phenomenal consciousness, which is an intrinsic feature of mentality, is itself inherently intentional. Phenomenal intentionality, in turn, grounds other kinds of intentionality that are metaphysically less fundamental - specifically, (a) certain kinds of mental reference (e.g., to concrete individuals and to natural kinds), and (b) the intentionality of public language.In section 2, 1 will address questions (2)-(4), on the basis of my favored answer to question (1). Given the contention that original intentionality is phenomenal intentionality, the answer to question (2) is no: original intentionality requires phenomenal consciousness with suitably rich intentional content; so, since phenomenal consciousness is an intrinsic feature of mentality whereas functional role is entirely relational and nonintrinsic, original intentionality cannot be constituted solely by the possession of internal states with some specific functional role. The answer to question (3) is maybe: it depends upon whether or not certain internal physical states instantiated by the robot would not only play suitable functional roles within the robot, but in addition would be states upon which the pertinent states of phenomenal consciousness - phenomenally intentional states - are supervenient. And the answer to question (4) is this: the real moral of Searle 's Chinese room thought experiment is that genuine original intentionality requires the presence of internal states with intrinsic phenomenal character that is inherently intentional - a feature that cannot be possessed by any entity (either robotic or flesh-and-blood) solely by virtue of the functional roles played by its internal states.In section 3, 1 will set forth a new argument in support of the contention that original intentionality is phenomenal intentionality. The argument will proceed via a series of thought-experimental scenarios that collectively constitute a sequence, similar in structure to a series of visual images that gradually change (say) from a good depiction of Elvis into a good depiction of Bill Clinton. Searle's original Chinese room thought experiment will be the initial stage in the morph sequence, occupying the Elvis slot.1. Phenomenal Intentionality, Externalistic Intentionality, and Linguistic MeaningMuch of the literature in recent philosophy of mind has embraced some version or other of functionalism concerning intentional mental states - and, moreover, strong externalism about mental intentionality. Roughly and generically, strong externalism is the view that all mental intentionality depends constitutively on certain external connections (e.g., causal, and/or covariational, and/or historical, and/or evolutionary) between a creature with mentality and that creature's wider environment.Lately Graham and Tienson and I have been articulating a general approach to mental intentionality that is very much at odds with the various versions of strong externalism that have recently been fashionable in philosophy of mind. \u2026",

      "abstract": "Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded cognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.",

However, we find that these successes sometimes lead to hype in which these models are being described as \u201cunderstanding\u201d language or capturing \u201cmeaning\u201d. In this position paper, we argue that a system trained only on form has a priori no way to learn meaning. In keeping with the ACL 2020 theme of \u201cTaking Stock of Where We\u2019ve Been and Where We\u2019re Going\u201d, we argue that a clear understanding of the distinction between form and meaning will help guide the field towards better science around natural language understanding.",
