      "abstract": "Do large language models like Chat-GPT or Claude meaningfully use the words they produce? Or are they merely clever prediction machines, simulating language use by producing statistically plausible text? There have already been some initial attempts to answer this question by showing that these models meet the criteria for entering meaningful states according to metasemantic theories of mental content. In this paper, I will argue for a different approach\u2014that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans\u2019 (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan\u2019s (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality\u2014dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system\u2014allows for the plausible result that LLM outputs are meaningful.",

In this\n paper, however, we will look at theories developed from Quine?s ideas -\n Millikan?s teleosemantics and Kornblith?s cognitive ethology. We will answer\n three questions: (i) Can a bee know?; (ii) What can a bee know?; and (iii)\n Does the bee know? First, we will answer the question of animal cognitive\n capacities using Kornblith?s understanding of the epistemic environment and\n the basic features of cognitive ethology. We will then set up teleosemantics\n as a framework in which Millikanin attempts to naturalize intentional states\n and answer the question of the knowledge content in animals. By\n understanding natural signs and considering the non-propositional content of\n mental representations in animals, we will answer the third question and\n show how Kornblith and cognitive ethologists attempt to track the processes\n of forming reliable true beliefs in different kinds of organisms. We will\n answer each of the three questions above by drawing on the research of\n apiologists and cognitive ethologists to provide empirical support for the\n theses of our work and so that we do not remain only on attempts, possible\n introductions, and anecdotes of naturalistic conceptions of knowledge, but\n provide concrete descriptions of the world and the place of knowledge in it.",

In their view, teleosemantics accounts for a poorer kind of relation between cognitive states and the world but lacks the theoretical tools to account for a richer kind. We show that their objection imposes two criteria on theories of content: a truth-evaluable criterion and an intensionality criterion. For the objection to go through, teleosemantics must be subject to both these criteria and must fail to satisfy them. We argue that teleosemantics meets the truth-evaluable criterion and is not required to meet the intensionality criterion. We conclude that Hutto and Myin\u2019s objection fails.",

The paper has two goals. First, we outline how a teleosemantic treatment of signal passing in predictive processing systems would work, and how it integrates with structural resemblance accounts. We show that the core explanatory motivations and conceptual machinery of teleosemantics and predictive processing mesh together well. Second, we argue this pluralist approach expands the range of empirical cases to which the predictive processing framework might be successfully applied. This is because our pluralism is practice-oriented. A range of different notions of content are used in the cognitive sciences to explain behaviour, and some of these cases look to employ teleosemantic notions. As a result, our pluralism gives predictive processing the scope to cover these cases.",

      "abstract": "Teleosemantic theories seek to explain mental representation in terms borrowed from the science of natural selection. There is an obvious attraction to the approach, as it has the potential to provide a purely naturalistic explanation of the normativity of mental content. If, as the teleosemanticist claims, the function of a given internal state is to represent the world as being thus-and-so, then for it to misrepresent is for it to fail to do what it is, in effect, supposed to do. Since the notion of a function\u2014of a trait that has a purpose\u2014can be cashed out in terms derived from evolutionary biology, the theory has the potential to make naturalistic sense of a crucial aspect of mental content. There are, of course, other naturalistic approaches to mental representation, but what marks teleosemantics as unique is that its explanation of content normativity flows from its core principle. Karen Neander\u2019s A Mark of the Mental (MM) is a densely argued and comprehensive defense of a particular teleosemantic theory. Its central concern is twofold: (i) to understand the explanatory role of representations\u2014intentional states\u2014in cognitive science, and (ii) to identify the grounds of intentionality\u2014the non-intentional facts on which intentionality \u2018constitutively ... depend[s]\u2019 [9]. Neander endorses an aetiological notion of biological function, which identifies the function of an item with what historically explains that item\u2019s existence\u2014with \u2018what items of that type were selected to do\u2019 [48\u20139]. This is wedded to a causal-informational theory of content. While the latter approach is not unique among teleosemanticists, MM is valuable in providing a careful and systematic defence of the view. Moreover, it departs from teleosemanticist orthodoxy in its deployment of what Neander calls \u2018response functions\u2019. 628 BOOK REVIEWS",

      "abstract": "AMark of the Mental: In Defense of Informational Teleosemantics is Karen Neander\u2019s long-awaited first book. It achieves three main goals. First, it establishes teleosemantics as a leading candidate for naturalizing intentionality. Second, it develops a highly original and innovative version of teleosemantics, informational teleosemantics (IT), which stands in contrast to consumer-based accounts. Third, it offers plausible solutions to the various content indeterminacy problems that have historically plagued the topic. Throughout the book, Neander exhibits the deft interweaving of philosophy of biology and philosophy of mind that has marked her career. Stated roughly, IT says that the content of a (sensory-perceptual) representation is whatever is supposed to cause it (149). More precisely, at its most basic, IT holds that a sensory-perceptual representation, R, is about C if there is a mechanism that has the function of producing R\u2019s in response to C\u2019s (151). So, for example, a specificmidbrain activation pattern in a toadmight be about long wriggling things, if there is a mechanism in the toad\u2019s brain that has the function of producing that pattern in response to longwriggling things. In this, IT differs from consumer-oriented views, which hold that a representation\u2019s content depends on the mechanisms that utilize (consume) it. For example, in Millikan\u2019s consumer-based view, a toad\u2019s midbrain activation pattern is about worms because that is what it must correspond to for the consumer",

      "abstract": "Abstract Teleosemantic theories aim to naturalize mental representation through the use of functions, typically based on past selection processes. However, the historical dependence of these theories has faced severe criticism, leading some philosophers to develop ahistorical alternatives. This article presents a new dilemma for all ahistorical teleosemantic theories, focusing in particular on the theories proposed by Timothy Schroeder and Bence Nanay. These theories require certain dispositions in the producers or consumers of mental representations, but the appeal to dispositions puts the proponents in an undesirable position: mental content is either overly dependent on current circumstances or ultimately dependent on historical factors.",
