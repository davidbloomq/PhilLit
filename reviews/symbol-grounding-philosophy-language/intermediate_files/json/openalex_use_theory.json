      "abstract": "AbstractIt has recently been suggested that a distinctive metaphysical relation\u2014 'Grounding'\u2014is ultimately at issue in contexts in which some goings-on are said to hold 'in virtue of'', be (constitutively) 'metaphysically dependent on', or be 'nothing over and above' some others. Grounding is supposed to do good work (better than merely modal notions, in particular) in illuminating metaphysical dependence. I argue that Grounding is also unsuited to do this work. To start, Grounding alone cannot do this work, for bare claims of Grounding leave open such basic questions as whether Grounded goings-on exist, whether they are reducible to or rather distinct from Grounding goings-on, whether they are efficacious, and so on; but in the absence of answers to such basic questions, we are not in position to assess the associated claim or theses concerning metaphysical dependence. There is no avoiding appeal to the specific metaphysical relations typically at issue in investigations into dependence\u2014for example, type or token identity, functional realization, classical mereological parthood, the set membership relation, the proper subset relation, the determinable/determinate relation, and so on\u2014which are capable of answering these questions. But, I argue, once the specific relations are on the scene, there is no need for Grounding.

See also, for example: Sider, Writing the Book of the World; Raven, 'In Defence of Ground'; Trogdon, 'Introduction to Grounding'; Bennett, Making Things Up; and the contributions to Correia and Schneider, Metaphysical Grounding (see esp. Correia and Schneider, 'Grounding'; Audi, 'Clarification and Defense'; Fine, 'Guide to Ground'; Koslicki, 'Varieties of Ontological Dependence'; Schaffer, 'Grounding, Transitivity, and Contrastivity'). A good source for historical references on the topic of a general relation of ontological dependence going beyond the usual suspects (including Lowe, Possibility of Metaphysics; Witmer, Butchard, and Trogdon, 'Intrinsicality without Naturalness'; and Schneider, 'Certain Kind of Trinity') is Trogdon, 'Introduction to Grounding'.2 Fine allows that there are multiple Grounding relations, and maintains that 'we should understand the generic relation as some kind of \"disjunction\" of the special relations'; moreover, on his view each special relation 'comes in different 'flavors''. Fine, 'Guide to Ground', 4, 16.3 Proponents disagree about the relata of Grounding: for Schaffer these are entities of any category; for Fine these are propositions that are typically but need not be true (though he also refers to these as 'facts', and lately favors taking the relata to be sentences). Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What'; Fine, 'Question of Realism'. For Rosen these are facts, understood as 'structured entities built up from worldly items [along lines of] true Russellian propositions'. Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', 4 (though see Section V.ii for discussion of how Rosen is led to depart from traditional Russellianism). Motivations for taking the relata to be representational reflect a conception of Grounding as entering into explanations, suited to be reasoned with (as in Fine's 'logic of ground'). My view is that in specifying the relata relevant to grounding explanations, metaphysicians should talk about the worldly goings-on directly; compare causation and causal explanation, where theorizing cuts to the metaphysical chase; Schaffer makes the same point. Schaffer, 'Grounding, Transitivity, and Contrastivity', 2. That said, given the worldly nature of Fine's and Rosen's propositional facts, and given that grounding relations between worldly entities bring facts/Russellian propositions in their wake, there are presumably translation strategies between these accounts; ibid..4 Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What', 379. See also Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence, 109.5 Fine, 'Question of Realism', 2001, 10. Note that Fine's focus on reductive means of characterizing metaphysical dependence need not be seen as exclusive\u2014as, for example, non-reductive physicalists think.6 Fine, 'Essence and Modality'.7 Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What', 364.8 Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', 113. See also Fine, 'Guide to Ground', 37.9 Fine, 'Guide to Ground', 38. See also Audi, whose 'argument for Grounding' proceeds from the premises (1) If one fact explains another, then the one plays some role in determining the other, and (2) There are explanations in which the explaining fact plays no causal role with respect to the explained fact, to the conclusion that (3) There is a non-causal relation of determination. Audi, 'Clarification and Defense'.10 Schaffer is explicit that by his lights, Grounding is hyperintensional; and though Fine and Rosen do not explicitly couch their posit in these terms, other of their commitments (e.g. Fine's supposition that metaphysically necessary connection is necessary, though not sufficient, for metaphysical dependence) suggest that they, too, take Grounding to be hyperintensional. My own view is that metaphysically necessary connection is not necessary for metaphysical dependence; see Wilson, 'Non-Reductive Realization'. For further discussion of this issue, see Trogdon, 'Introduction to Grounding'.11 Here too (see note 3) I understand talk of Grounding's being 'primitive' in metaphysical, not representational terms; indefinability of representations is not (idealism and the like aside) to the point.12 Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What', 364 (emphasis in original).13 Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence, 113\u201314 (emphasis in original).14 In Section II.i I provide specific case studies of how various of these relations are deployed in contexts relevant to formulating physicalism or naturalism, and to providing accounts of dispositions.15 If this claim is not obvious, then beyond the case studies I provide in Section II.i, I suggest searching under the aforementioned topics and relations in PhilPapers; there are thousands of confirming instances. The dialectical point I am making here, while prefatory to the main argumentative thrust of this paper, is important for a number of reasons, not least because the just-so story elides extensive swathes of significant literature on metaphysical dependence (and, relatedly, fundamentality).16 Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What', 351\u20132.17 Fine, 'Question of Realism', 13.18 Fine, 'Guide to Ground', 42. There are tricky interpretive questions about Fine's (in Fine, 'Question of Realism') use of 'realist' and 'anti-realist', as characterizing metaphysical views. On the standard understanding (see Miller, 'Realism'), if one is anti-realist about the Xs one (at least) denies the (real) existence of the Xs. This does not entirely comport with Fine's stated aim of making sense of metaphysical anti-realism, associated with conceptions of the real as the factual and the (ontologically) irreducible, respectively; for while non-factualist positions (expressivism, eliminativism) are anti-realist in the standard sense, reductionists are realists in the standard sense (the reducible being as real as that to which it is reduced). Fine admits that 'Many philosophers do not take reduction to have antirealist import' ('Question of Realism', 4, note 2), but since ontological reduction involves some or other identity claim (forcing the existence of the reducible) it is unclear, on the standard understanding, whether there are any anti-realist reductionists. On what appears to be Fine's alternative understanding, if one is anti-realist about the Xs, then one (at least) denies that the Xs are fundamental. Hence it is that, though Fine ultimately characterizes the real in primitive terms, nonetheless attention to Grounding ('nothing more than') claims can, Fine maintains, illuminate and help legislate realist/anti-realist disputes, in assisting in the determination of what is and is not fundamental. A 'non-fundamentalist' understanding of anti-realism makes (terminologically confusing and overly broad) room for reductive anti-realism, as the view that Xs exist, but are not fundamental (a claim also, confusingly, endorsed by non-reductivists, as in the physicalism debates); it also makes sense of non-factualist anti-realism, as the view that Xs are neither fundamental nor Grounded in the fundamental. One question about the target application of Fine's alternative conception reflects that reductionist ontological views are identity-based; hence if Grounding is to play a role in illuminating reductive anti-fundamentalism, then Grounding must be compatible with identity. I am fine with that, but proponents of Grounding typically are not; see Section V.ii for further discussion.19 Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', 111.20 It is worth noting that the concerns raised in this and future sections do not hinge on any general complaints about general notions. As I periodically track along the way, a general relation of Causation (should anyone care to posit such a relation) is not subject to the difficulties facing Grounding.21 Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', 111\u201312 (emphasis in original).22 See Schiffer, Remnants of Meaning; Kim, 'Supervenience'; Heil, Nature of True Minds; Horgan, 'From Supervenience to Superdupervenience'; Wilson, 'Supervenience-based Formulations'. The examples to follow are drawn from the latter paper.23 For example, Broad, Mind and its Place.24 I argue that robust emergentism is both coherent and naturalistically acceptable, when interpreted as involving the coming into play of a new fundamental interaction upon the occurrence or instantiation of certain complex states (this is one way of characterizing the traditional understanding of robust emergence as involving both dependence and fundamentality); and I argue that various philosophical or scientific commitments (e.g. a view on which properties are essentially individuated by certain systems of laws, or holism about fundamental interactions) would, if held, support taking robustly emergent goings-on to supervene with metaphysical necessity on physical goings-on. Wilson, 'Supervenience-based Formulations' (and elsewhere). This discussion (see also other citations in note 25) is relevant to assessing Bennett's claim that 'independence is a\u2014the\u2014central aspect of our notion of fundamentality'. Bennett, Making Things Up.25 See, for example, McLaughlin, 'Rise and Fall'; Wilson, 'Supervenience-based Formulations'; Barnes, 'Emergence and Fundamentality'.26 Sider (pers. comm.) suggested that a proponent of Grounding could make sense of dependent over and above goings-on by giving an account of the dependence in purely modal terms, then adding a claim of such dependence to the claim of (failure of) Grounding. But first (as is a common theme in this paper), one should not build controversial assumptions (e.g. that the notion of dependence at issue in robust emergence is to be understood in purely modal terms) into general resources for metaphysical theorizing. And, second, this 'supplementary' strategy undermines the motivation for Grounding according to which supervenience is too coarse-grained to characterize appropriately metaphysical dependence; for when supervenience is appropriately supplemented (e.g. by claims of conceptual entailment, as in Chalmers, Conscious Mind), it too can make finer-grained distinctions.27 Per usual, Fine's work anticipates this concern, in explicitly allowing for partial Grounding. I cannot enter into the more subtle details of Fine's investigations here; suffice to say that a relation of partial Grounding is not up to the task of making sense of the usual ('in virtue of'; 'nothing over and above') idioms of metaphysical dependence that proponents of Grounding take as implicitly defining their posit. It is especially unclear how a relation of partial Grounding is supposed to comport with Schaffer's and Rosen's supposition that Grounding is primitive. Is the basic primitive Partial Grounding, and if so, how does this comport with Complete Grounding? Note that one cannot define Complete Grounding in terms of Partial Grounding, along lines of defining parthood in terms of primitive proper parthood and identity. Rather, to handle the case of robust emergentism, primitivists about Grounding will require, it seems, at least two primitively related primitive relations.28 Supervenience, by way of contrast, is capable of tracking (at least existential) dependence on its own, so in this respect it does better than Grounding for purposes of characterizing metaphysical structure.29 Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', 111 (emphasis added). It seems that we must here interpret 'genuine' in terms of existence: unlike Fine's use of 'real', Rosen's use of 'genuine' cannot mean 'fundamental', since then the quoted passage will not make sense. As such, Rosen's characterization of naturalism as compatible with the normative's being both Grounded in the natural ('for the naturalist, every normative fact and every intentional fact is grounded in \u2026 non-normative, non-intentional facts', 111) and not existing does not track any existing naturalist position. Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that eliminativism about the normative or intentional is compatible with vacuous satisfaction of the naturalist thesis ('Every fact tops a naturalistic tree', 112); but in that case, a Grounding formulation of naturalism does not realize the advertised virtue of allowing an 'exact' formulation of naturalism ('if we take the 'in virtue of' idiom for granted, we can [express the naturalist's position about the normative and the intentional] exactly', 111).30 Fine, 'Question of Realism, 15.31 Ibid., 21.32 Either interpretation of Fine's claim may seem at odds with his intended use of Grounding, as enabling us to 'determine the viability of a realist or anti-realist stand' on the goings-on at issue; we shall see how he resolves this in Section II.iii.33 One might wonder (as Karen Bennett and Jon Litland did; pers. comm.) how the holding of a Grounding relation can leave open the existence of the Grounded: does not the holding of a relation require that all the relata exist? It would seem so, whether worldly entities, facts, or Russellian propositions are at issue; but such factivity is hard to square with the explicit pronouncements of ontological neutrality. Since Fine's propositions are not explicitly Russellian (notwithstanding that he sometimes refers to them as 'facts') he is in a somewhat better position to maintain that the truth (or counterfactual truth) of a Grounded proposition leaves open the existence (counterfactual existence) of the worldly entities whose dependence is at issue in the proposition (which he presumably wants to do in order to make sense of standard anti-realist accounts). Alternatively (as Litland has suggested) one might preserve the stated neutrality by conceiving of Grounding in operator-based rather than relational terms. I cannot read between all the relevant lines here, but am just going to proceed by taking at face value the several explicit remarks about the ontological neutrality and relational nature of Grounding.34 I say 'almost never', since conditions of epistemic uncertainty or studied metaphysical neutrality might motivate sticking with a general grounding claim; here the exceptions prove the rule.35 See, for example: Place, 'Is Consciousness a Brain Process'; Smart, 'Sensations and Brain Processes'. For 'realizer functionalist' variations on the theme of type-identity, see: Lewis, 'Argument for the Identity Theory', 'Reduction of Mind'; Armstrong, Materialist Theory; Kim, 'Myth of Non-Reductive Materialism'.36 See, for example: Davidson, 'Mental Events'; Macdonald and Macdonald, 'How to Be'; Ehring, 'Part\u2013Whole Physicalism'. In saying that normative states might be grounded in naturalistic states by way of type or token identity, I am assuming, contra some proponents of Grounding, that identity may be a grounding relation. In Section V, I argue that proponents of Grounding are wrong to deny this, and I address the question (familiar from the physicalism debates) of how to make sense of the intended direction of priority in cases in which nothing over and above-ness is understood in terms of identity. For now I make the following observation: insofar as proponents of Grounding typically link this posit to the standard ('metaphysically depends on', 'in virtue of', 'nothing over and above', and so on) idioms of dependence, as they enter into naturalist and physicalist theses in particular, and insofar as standard versions of these theses explicitly interpret the idioms in terms of identity, the default position would appear to be that grounding, and moreover Grounding, should be compatible with identity, whatever proponents of Grounding have maintained.37 See, for example: Putnam, 'Minds and Machines'; Shoemaker, 'Functionalism and Qualia'.38 See, for example: Yablo, 'Mental Causation'; Macdonald and Macdonald, 'How to Be'; Wilson, 'Determination, Realization', 'How Superduper'.39 See, for example: Clapp, 'Disjunctive Properties'; Shoemaker, 'Realization and Mental Causation'; Paul, 'Logical Parts'.40 See Wilson, 'How Superduper', 'Non-Reductive Realization'; Shoemaker, 'Realization and Mental Causation', Physical Realization.41 See, for example: Paul Churchland, 'Eliminative Materialism'; Patricia Churchland, Neurophilosophy.42 To be sure, proponents of a given specific relation will not always agree as regards all of its implications for the dependent relata. For example, the that token of the determinable/determinate relation are and I take determinable/determinate to be But in general there is on what the holding of a given relation has in contexts in which metaphysical dependence is at issue, and, in any case, insofar as the relation is there is that about its can Macdonald and Macdonald, 'How to Be'; Yablo, 'Mental Causation'; Wilson, 'How Superduper', 'Determination, For example, view that Rosen as the of Grounding: of a are always grounded in its and A is in virtue of the of the that make it perhaps with the of and Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', Here proponents of such a view do not with a bare Grounding but rather on to specific accounts of the grounding relation at As different views about the relation between and their causal that have been in the literature views about the relation between properties and physical David a according to which any is with its causal Stephen a according to which any of a is with an of one of its causal with and a according to which a is a of some causal or \u2026 There are other views The point the confirming that is up to its in with metaphysical dependence) is that investigations into metaphysical dependence are with an to or assessing what specific grounding might be to hold in a given Rosen, 'Metaphysical Dependence', (see note if supervenience is supplemented (e.g. by claims of conceptual then it too can make finer-grained I say since in view the direction of dependence in these cases is not a the fact that is or is metaphysically to whatever fact when the is the fact that there will or will not be a is metaphysically though (as it might neither of the is whatever fact the to be said (or about the of so to in this for the direction of dependence of and if is If the relations at issue are understood as then making sense of the direction of dependence will require in which the direction of dependence further to what I the motivation for this motivation and that the does not an appeal to Grounding is the topic of Section The will have that both Grounding claims and of Grounding claims if the claims of certain proponents are at face compatible with anti-realist Fine, 'Question of Realism, It is here that Schaffer and Fine do not have the same notion of in if the at issue in Fine's claim involves since Schaffer's claim to Fine's to My own view is that we should not of existence this way, but in any case nothing on this issue for purposes of the general See Wilson, about Schaffer, 'On What Grounds What', (emphasis in Ibid., See also Audi, his general with both Fine's and 'On grounded and are and grounded are an of over and above the in which they are Audi, 'Clarification and See Wilson, Fine, 'Question of Realism', (emphasis in and to an for to the between Grounding and The here is related but different that to be in Section V, of whether Grounding is as a of the grounding Here it is not that is at issue, but rather the idea that an appeal to Grounding may be in specific investigations into metaphysical dependence.

      "abstract": "A demanding challenge in cross-cultural design is how to make a usable technology meaningful to local users. This book examines the disconnect of action and meaning in cross-cultural design and presents an innovative framework \u201cCulturally Localized User Experience (CLUE)\u201d to tackle the problem. Drawing from three strands of practice theories\u2014activity theory, British cultural studies, and rhetorical genre theory, the CLUE approach regards local culture as the dynamic nexus of contextual interactions and integrates action and meaning through a dialogical, cyclical design process in order to design a technology that would engage local users within meaningful social practices. With five in-depth case studies of mobile text messaging use in American and Chinese contexts, this book demonstrates that a technology creating for a culturally localized user experience mediates both instrumental practices and social meanings. It calls for a change in cross-cultural design practices from simply applying cultural conventions in design to localizing for social affordances with rich understandings of use activities in context. Meanwhile, the vivid user stories at sites of technology-in-use show the power of \u201cuser localization\u201d in connecting design and use, which the book believes essential for the success of an emerging technology like mobile messaging in an era of participatory culture. This book is divided into three parts: theoretical grounding for key concepts, case histories, and scholarly implications. It explores how to create culture-sensitive technology for local users in this increasingly globalized world with a rising participatory culture.",

Although there is no doubt about the relevance of authenticity in personal relationships, published research has yet not thoroughly explored the concept\u2019s meaning in reference to brands. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Based on socio-psychological attribution theories and grounding on the identity-based brand management approach, a causal model of brand authenticity is developed. The hypothesized relationships are analyzed using the partial-least-squares approach. The primary data are based on an online survey conducted in Germany ( n = 600). The respondents were asked about fast-food and beer brands. Findings \u2013 The data show that brand authenticity positively impacts on brand trust. Furthermore, the key antecedents in the model (consistency, continuity and individuality of a brand) drive the perception of brand authenticity as hypothesized. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The model should be tested in further product categories and moderators should be integrated. Originality/value \u2013 The findings suggest that authenticity is perceived when a brand is consistent, continuous and individual in its behavior. Nevertheless, the empirical results indicate that the factor individuality has the lowest influence on perceived brand authenticity. This is an interesting finding, as being \u201cunique\u201d is commonly regarded as an important success factor in branding. Although the study\u2019s findings confirm its relevancy, they relativize its importance: being consistent, meaning that a brand fulfills its brand promise at every brand-touch point, and being continuous, meaning that the brand promise reflects the essential core of the brand, are of major importance.",

      "abstract": "Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted, and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches, and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues, we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation, and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.",

Why should the same primitive image\u2014schemas occur in the world\u2019s languages, even though spatial relations differ widely? What meth- odologies should we use to study them? How is linguistic theory affected by the answers to these questions? We argue that common primitive image-schemas arise from common brain structures, and that linguistic theory must be based on, and consistent with, what we know about the brain and experience. Focusing on motion-related experiences, we show how linguistics and neuroscience, when taken together, increase our understanding of image schemas. First, we look at how image schemas are expressed in language. Then, working from the assump~ tion that linguistic structure is an expression of neural structure, we shift our at- tention to the brain, showing how recent findings in neuroscience can support an analysis of image schemas that relates the structure of experience, thought, and language to neural structure. This analysis not only enhances our current under- standing of image schemas, but also suggests future avenues for image schema research.

Introduction The idea of image schemas emerged from the empirical research on spatial- relations terms by Len Talmy (1972, 1975, 1978, 1983) and Ron Langacker (1976, 1987) in the mid\u2014l970\u2019s.

Discussion focuses on how shared meaning--called common ground--is achieved, the process of grounding utterances under real-time constraints, and how the media characteristics of devices affect the grounding process. A joint action analysis of grounding will be applied to examples of word-board and Voice Output Communication Aid (VOCA)-mediated conversations to show how participants organize their talk around specific media constraints to conduct their conversations and solve communication problems. The authors argue that this model of device-mediated communication performance, or some variety of it, has the potential to reconcile many of the individual research findings in this field within a single explanatory framework. If successful, this approach could be used to evaluate future research with an empirically-based model of communication performance.",

      "abstract": "Meaning is embodied - but it is also social. If Cognitive Linguistics is to be a complete theory of language in use, it must cover the whole spectrum from grounded cognition to discourse struggles and bullshit. This book tries to show how. Cognitive Linguistics knocked down the wall between language and the experiential content of the human mind. Frame semantics, embodiment, conceptual construal, figure-ground organization, metaphorical mapping, and mental spaces are among the results of this breakthrough, which at the same time provided cognitive science as a whole with an essential human dimension. A new phase began when Cognitive Linguistics started to see itself as part of the wider movement of 'usage-based' linguistics. Bringing about an alliance between mind and discourse, it complemented the conceptual dimension that had been dominant until then with a 'use' dimension - thereby living up to the explicit 'experiential' commitment of Cognitive Linguistics. This outward expansion is continuing: The focus on 'meaning construction', which began with the theory of blending, highlights emergent, online effects rather than underlying mappings. Cognitive Linguistics is integrating the evolutionary perspective, which links up individual and population-based features of language. The empirical obligations incurred by this expansion have led to greatly increased attention to corpus and experimental methods, especially in relation to sociolinguistic and language acquisition research. The book describes this development and goes on to discuss the foundational challenge that it creates for Cognitive Linguistics as it begins to cover issues that are also central to types of discourse analysis focusing on social processes of determination. The book argues for a synthesis based on a renewed Cognitive Linguistics, which can accommodate everything from bodily grounding to deconstructible floating signifiers in an integrated complete picture, which also covers the roles of arbitrariness and structure.",

Using simulations, we illustrate how this generalization offers a resolution to several issues of theoretical significance within sociology and social psychology by balancing cultural consensus with individual deviations from shared meanings, balancing meaning verification with the learning processes reflective of change, and accounting for noise in communicating identity. We also show how the model speaks to debates about core features of the self, which can be understood as stable and yet malleable, coherent and yet composed of multiple identities that may carry competing meanings. We discuss applications of the model in different areas of sociology, implications for understanding identity and social interaction, as well as the theoretical grounding of computational models of social behavior.",

      "abstract": "Long before there were formal organizations or mass media, there was face-to-face interaction--the practice which comprises very core of the study of communication. Until recently, however, research in the field of interpersonal communication has been dominated by a behavioral science approach closely aligned with experimental psychology. This timely and provocative volume critiques the limitations of past models, exploring a range of social which help bring communication up to date. Social approaches, writes Leeds-Hurwitz, question whether the traditional theoretical assumptions and research methods followed in the field are still valid and appropriate. While the roots of these approaches are diverse and interdisciplinary, they overlap in their concern for the construction of self, other, and event, and in their acknowledgment of the researcher's role in establishing not only the research questions but also the research context. Social approaches stress the necessity of recognizing the impact of cultural differences on communication research, and identify the ways in which research inquiry creates meanings at the same time as it investigates them. Most importantly, they focus on instances of contact between individuals, the actual transactions in which people engage. Together they demonstrate the ability to disregard labels in pursuit of a common goal, the construction of a more adequate understanding of human interaction. Robert T. Craig's Foreword describes the historical tension in interpersonal communication between behavioral science approaches, on the one hand, and interpretive approaches, on the other. Parts I and II of the volume highlight the theoretical underpinnings of approaches and the philosophical grounding of some of the more central ideas. Part III elaborates on the assumptions shared by approaches, focusing on a series of key concepts, including the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research; reflexivity; constructionism; and the individual. Part IV begins the task of applying approaches to particular research topics, including the use of case studies, rapport in research interviews, ethnography as theory, continuity in relationships, and the co-construction of personal narratives. Part V examines where the various chapters lead us, making a strong case for practical theory as the necessary next step. A unique overview of current theoretical innovations in the study of interpersonal communication, SOCIAL APPROACHES TO COMMUNICATION belongs on the shelf of every professional and student in communication. It will be especially valuable to those interested in communication theory, interpersonal communication, and interaction.",

      "abstract": "Four experiments (E1-E2-E3-E4) investigated whether different acquisition modalities lead to the emergence of differences typically found between concrete and abstract words, as argued by the words as tools (WAT) proposal. To mimic the acquisition of concrete and abstract concepts, participants either manipulated novel objects or observed groups of objects interacting in novel ways (Training 1). In TEST 1 participants decided whether two elements belonged to the same category. Later they read the category labels (Training 2); labels could be accompanied by an explanation of their meaning. Then participants observed previously seen exemplars and other elements, and were asked which of them could be named with a given label (TEST 2). Across the experiments, it was more difficult to form abstract than concrete categories (TEST 1); even when adding labels, abstract words remained more difficult than concrete words (TEST 2). TEST 3 differed across the experiments. In E1 participants performed a feature production task. Crucially, the associations produced with the novel words reflected the pattern evoked by existing concrete and abstract words, as the first evoked more perceptual properties. In E2-E3-E4, TEST 3 consisted of a color verification task with manual/verbal (keyboard-microphone) responses. Results showed the microphone use to have an advantage over keyboard use for abstract words, especially in the explanation condition. This supports WAT: due to their acquisition modality, concrete words evoke more manual information; abstract words elicit more verbal information. This advantage was not present when linguistic information contrasted with perceptual one. Implications for theories and computational models of language grounding are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on dynamic capabilities and, more generally, the resource-based view of the firm. We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed 'best practice'). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.
