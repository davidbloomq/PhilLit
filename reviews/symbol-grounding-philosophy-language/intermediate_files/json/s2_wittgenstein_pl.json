      "abstract": "A popular view in metasemantics is the view that a speaker\u2019s dispositions regarding the use of a symbol determine the meaning of that symbol for the speaker. Kripke (Wittgenstein on rules and private language, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1982) arguments against simple versions of semantic dispositionalism have inspired ever new versions. A recent account in the literature, due to Warren (No\u00fbs 54(2):257\u2013289, 2020) offers a sophisticated version of semantic dispositionalism whereby certain conditions are imposed on speaker\u2019s dispositions to count as meaning determining\u2014conditions we can refer to as \u2018standard\u2019. In this paper, I argue that there are a number of cases that suggest that even under such conditions, a speaker\u2019s meaning and their dispositions can come apart, and that this suggests that dispositional accounts of semantic content presuppose that there are semantic norms, independent of a speaker\u2019s dispositions, and thus do not explain semantic content. I conclude that, since these problems generalise to non-standard dispositionalist accounts, the dispositionalist\u2019s prospects are dim.",

      "abstract": "There are two paradigms in language processing, as characterised by symbolic compositional and statistical distributional modelling, which may be regarded as based upon the principles of compositionality (or symbolic recursion) and of contextuality (or the distributional hypothesis), respectively. Starting with philosophy of language as in Frege and Wittgenstein, we elucidate the nature of language and language processing from interdisciplinary perspectives across different fields of science. At the same time, we shed new light on conceptual issues in language processing on the basis of recent advances in Transformer-based models such as BERT and GPT-3. We link linguistic cognition with mathematical cognition through these discussions, explicating symbol grounding/emergence problems shared by both of them. We also discuss whether animal cognition can develop recursive compositional information processing.",

      "abstract": "The paper examines Johann Georg Hamann\u2019s influence on Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s late philosophy. Wittgenstein\u2019s letters, diaries and Drury\u2019s memoirs show that Wittgenstein read Hamann\u2019s writings in the early 1930s and 1950s. Wittgenstein\u2019s diary notes and the Cambridge lectures show that Wittgenstein\u2019s discussion of Hamann\u2019s views in 1931 corresponds to adopting a Hamannian view of symbols and rule-following. The view of language as an intertwining of signs, objects and meanings in use forms a common core in the philosophies of Hamann and Wittgenstein. The harmony of language and reality takes place in communicative use, so non-communicative private languages and pre-linguistic ideal forms of representation are not possible. Language is a free response to reality, and it involves belief-systems and trust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Meaning, Interpreting, Understanding In his Kritik der verstehenden Vernunft (2018), Vittorio H\u00f6sle attempts to develop a comprehensive foundation for the so-called Geisteswissenschaften (humanities). The basis for this foundational work is a conception of understanding that ties all understanding to the interpretative grasp of what we and others mean by the use of certain symbols or linguistic expressions. The present essay argues that this makes H\u00f6sle\u2019s approach vulnerable to a particular form of skepticism, as it is expounded by Saul Kripke in his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language (1982). The first part of the essay outlines this skeptical challenge and its implications for H\u00f6sle\u2019s conception of understanding. The second part advances the argument that this conception's vulnerability to skepticism undermines its viability as a foundation for the humanities. Instead, it invites the kind of skepticism described in Kripke\u2019s challenge, where understanding itself seems to be impossible. The essay concludes with some tentative suggestions for an alternative conception of understanding that not only avoids this skepticism altogether but also makes room for a way of thinking about the mental that is of independent interest.",

      "abstract": "By pointing to deep philosophical confusions endemic to cognitive science, Wittgenstein might seem an enemy of computational approaches. We agree (with Mills 1993) that while Wittgenstein would reject the classicist\u2019s symbols and rules approach, his observations align well with connectionist or neural network approaches. While many connectionisms that dominated the later twentieth century could fall prey to criticisms of biological, pedagogical, and linguistic implausibility, current connectionist approaches can resolve those problems in a Wittgenstein-friendly manner. We (a) present the basics of a Vector Symbolic Architecture formalism, inspired by Smolensky (1990), and indicate how high-dimensional vectors can operate in a context-sensitive and object-independent manner in biologically plausible time scales, reflecting Wittgenstein\u2019s notions of language-games and family resemblance; we (b) show how \u201csoft\u201d symbols for such a formalism can be formed with plausible learning cycles using Sparse Distributed Memory, resolving disputes surrounding Wittgenstein\u2019s private language argument; and (c) show how connectionist networks can extrapolate meaningful patterns to solve problems, providing \u201cways to go on\u201d without explicit rules, which indicates linguistic plausibility. Connectionism thus provides a systematicity and productivity that is more than a mere implementation of a classical approach, and provides Wittgenstein-friendly and Wittgenstein-illuminating models of mind and language for cognitive science.",
