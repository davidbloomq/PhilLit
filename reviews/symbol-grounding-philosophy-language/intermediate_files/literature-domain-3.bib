====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Meta-semantics investigates what makes semantic facts obtain—the foundations
of meaning itself. It asks: in virtue of what do expressions have the semantic
contents they do? This domain is distinct from first-order semantics (which
specifies what expressions mean) and addresses the grounding question of what
determines those meanings. Major positions include: use-based accounts (meaning
grounded in linguistic practice), causal-historical theories (reference fixed
by causal chains), teleosemantic views (meaning grounded in biological function),
interpretationist approaches (meaning determined by interpretation), and
reference magnetism (naturalness constrains reference). Recent work has
increasingly questioned idealized assumptions in traditional meta-semantics,
exploring non-ideal foundations that account for power, diversity of goals,
and social position. The field has also seen growth in conceptual engineering—
the normative project of revising concepts—which raises meta-semantic questions
about the feasibility and mechanisms of semantic change.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to evaluating whether the symbol grounding problem (SGP)
presupposes a narrow meta-semantic view. If the SGP assumes denotational or
referential semantics must be grounded in a particular way, examining the full
landscape of meta-semantic positions reveals whether that assumption is
warranted. The recent emphasis on non-ideal foundations and use-based accounts
provides alternatives to purely referential approaches, potentially dissolving
or reframing the grounding problem.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Relatively few papers directly connect meta-semantic theory to the symbol
grounding problem as formulated in AI/cognitive science. Most meta-semantic
work focuses on natural language rather than formal or artificial symbol
systems. The interaction between meta-semantics and embodied/grounded cognition
remains under-explored philosophically.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay attention to the distinction between semantic theories (which specify
meanings) and meta-semantic theories (which explain what grounds those meanings).
Consider whether different meta-semantic positions would diagnose the SGP
differently—some might see it as a pseudo-problem arising from false meta-
semantic assumptions. The recent turn toward non-ideal and pragmatic foundations
may offer resources for reframing grounding concerns.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Interpretationism (5 papers): Meaning determined by interpretation practices
- Reference magnetism (4 papers): Natural properties constrain reference
- Use-based theories (3 papers): Linguistic practice grounds meaning
- Non-ideal foundations (3 papers): Social context shapes semantic facts
- Conceptual engineering (3 papers): Normative dimension of meaning revision

  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669592.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume systematically distinguishes three dimensions of meta-semantics: (1) basic meta-semantics addressing the grounding question of what non-semantic facts semantic facts supervene on, (2) theory of meaning concerned with the essence or nature of meaning (e.g., whether meaning is normative), and (3) metaphysics of semantic values investigating whether semantic values should be understood in terms of truth and reference or their functional roles. The introduction argues this tripartite division clarifies longstanding confusions in philosophy of language between semantics proper and its foundations.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding contemporary meta-semantic debates. The volume's framework helps evaluate whether the SGP conflates semantic and meta-semantic questions. If the SGP assumes a particular answer to the grounding question (e.g., that reference must be causally grounded), this volume's taxonomy reveals that as one among multiple meta-semantic options. The distinction between semantics and meta-semantics may show the SGP operates at the wrong level of analysis.

  POSITION: Represents the mainstream contemporary approach to meta-semantics as a distinct philosophical subdiscipline. Synthesizes work from leading figures (Caie, Eklund, Speaks, et al.) and establishes methodological standards for the field.

  doi = {10.1093/9780191915925.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses a second-order foundational question: what makes meta-semantic theories themselves true? Defends "meta-internalism"—the view that foundations of reference and meaning are anchored in individual dispositions and psychological states of language users, not broader community-based or external factors. Argues this internalist meta-meta-semantics is compatible with semantic externalism as usually understood and actually explains why externalism is true. Examines reference failure, conceptual engineering, and methodology of reference theories through this lens.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to evaluating the SGP's presuppositions. If meta-internalism is correct, semantic grounding involves psychological states and dispositions—suggesting symbol grounding is indeed a real issue about linking internal states to referents. However, the compatibility with semantic externalism complicates simple "internalism solves grounding" narratives. The book's recent publication (2025) makes it essential for understanding current debates.

  POSITION: Defends internalism at the meta-meta-semantic level while accommodating externalist semantic theories. Challenges purely social or community-based approaches to meta-semantics.

  title = {Non-Ideal Foundations of Language},
  year = {2022},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.4324/9781003188537},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditional philosophy of language (Lewis, Grice, Stalnaker) has mistakenly focused on highly idealized linguistic contexts where cooperative agents share the goal of gaining information. This abstracts away from power, ideology, social position, and diversity of goals—factors crucial for explaining semantic and pragmatic phenomena. Keiser proposes a non-ideal foundational theory: language's essential function is to direct attention for achieving diverse social and political goals, not primarily information exchange. This framework is then applied to dog whistling, propaganda, racist speech, silencing, and manipulation.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges whether the SGP's framing assumes idealized, information-theoretic meta-semantics. If Keiser is right that meaning is fundamentally about attention-direction for diverse goals rather than information transmission, the grounding problem may look different—symbols might not need to "stand for" things in a referential sense to be meaningful. Opens space for use-based or pragmatic meta-semantics that could reframe or dissolve traditional grounding worries.

  POSITION: Non-ideal, pragmatic, attention-based meta-semantics. Critiques Lewisian and Gricean foundations while retaining insights from those frameworks.

  title = {The Role of Naturalness in Lewis's Theory of Meaning},
  journal = {Journal of the History of Analytical Philosophy},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {1},
  number = {10},
  doi = {10.4148/JHAP.V1I10.1620},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques the orthodox interpretation that David Lewis adopted a theory where predicate meaning is the most natural property consistent with use. Weatherson argues this interpretation, shared by supporters and critics, misrepresents Lewis's actual view. Drawing on Lewis's late work, Weatherson shows Lewis's theory gives naturalness a more nuanced role than the orthodox reading suggests, and that appreciating this strengthens rather than weakens Lewis's meta-semantic account. The paper defends Lewis against charges that reference magnetism leads to implausible semantic results.

  RELEVANCE: Reference magnetism—the idea that natural properties are easier to refer to—is a key meta-semantic proposal for solving indeterminacy problems in reference. If the SGP presupposes referential semantics needs grounding, understanding whether naturalness constrains reference helps evaluate that presupposition. Weatherson's defense of Lewis shows reference magnetism is more sophisticated than critics suggest, but still commits to metaphysical naturalness doing semantic work—a commitment the SGP might share or might avoid.

  POSITION: Interpretivist about Lewis's meta-semantics, defending a qualified role for naturalness in reference determination.

  volume = {3},
  number = {25},
  doi = {10.3998/ergo.12405314.0003.025},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends reference magnetism as the best solution to Moral Twin Earth thought experiments, which challenge naturalistic normative realism. Argues that (1) normative terms exhibit distinctive semantic stability compared to descriptive terms, and (2) realists need a unified meta-semantic theory explaining this difference. Reference magnetism—the view that some properties are "magnetic" and comparatively easy to refer to—provides such an explanation. Shows how magnetism can smoothly vindicate plausible judgments about semantic stability in normative discourse, though also offers a debunking alternative for those skeptical of realist metaphysics.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how meta-semantic theory connects to broader metaphysical commitments. If normative properties can be reference magnets, this suggests meta-semantic grounding doesn't require causal connections or physical reduction. This complicates the SGP: if reference can be magnetically constrained without causal grounding, perhaps the grounding problem is less pressing than it appears. Alternatively, if magnetism is metaphysically dubious, this strengthens the need for alternative grounding stories.

  POSITION: Defends reference magnetism as meta-semantic solution to indeterminacy, extending Lewis's ideas to normative discourse.

  number = {2},
  pages = {17--36},
  doi = {10.1080/00048402.2013.765900},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the reference magnetism hypothesis in meta-semantics—the view that objective naturalness of candidate meanings partly determines which meanings our words have. Argues there is no textual evidence Lewis endorsed this view, and that Lewis's actual account of language provides good reasons against it. Schwarz shows that Lewis's conventionalist framework for language, properly understood, solves indeterminacy problems without appealing to metaphysical naturalness as a semantic constraint. The paper undermines a popular meta-semantic strategy for solving reference determination problems.

  RELEVANCE: If Schwarz is right that reference magnetism is unmotivated, meta-semantics must rely more heavily on use, convention, or intention to fix reference. This would strengthen use-based approaches and potentially support conventionalist responses to the SGP—perhaps symbol grounding is conventional rather than metaphysically constrained. Alternatively, abandoning magnetism might make grounding problems more severe by removing a metaphysical constraint on indeterminacy.

  POSITION: Conventionalist meta-semantics following Lewis's actual view, rejecting reference magnetism as a meta-semantic principle.

  volume = {199},
  pages = {1955--1975},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-020-02868-w},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses what concepts are and how they can be engineered. Criticizes both semanticism (conceptual engineering aims to change linguistic meanings) and psychologism (it aims to change psychological structures) as insufficient. Proposes the "Dual Content View": concepts have both referential content and cognitive content, which are interrelated. Conceptual engineering targets both kinds of content. This view is independently plausible and helps solve difficult problems about what conceptual engineering revises and how such revisions are possible.

  RELEVANCE: Conceptual engineering raises meta-semantic questions about whether and how meanings can be deliberately changed. If concepts can be engineered, this suggests meta-semantic facts are somewhat malleable—challenging views where reference is rigidly determined by causal history or metaphysical naturalness. For the SGP, this raises the question: could we "engineer" symbol grounding by revising our semantic concepts? Or does grounding constrain engineering efforts? The dual content framework suggests engineering must respect both referential and cognitive dimensions.

  POSITION: Dual content view of concepts, bridging referential and cognitive approaches to conceptual engineering.

  volume = {178},
  pages = {2279--2291},
  doi = {10.1007/s11098-020-01546-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Deutsch's argument that conceptual engineering faces an unsurmountable dilemma: either it revises semantic meanings (but then faces implementation problems) or introduces new technical terms (but then becomes trivial). Koch argues there is a third option neglected by Deutsch: conceptual engineering can target concepts understood as having dual content (both referential and cognitive), making it both implementable and non-trivial. Further argues that even semantic meaning revision is no less feasible than other normative projects we pursue.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates meta-semantic assumptions matter for evaluating the feasibility of meaning revision. If the SGP assumes meanings are fixed by causal-historical chains or natural kinds, engineering seems impossible. But if meanings involve conventions, use patterns, or cognitive structures, they may be revisable. This connects to whether symbol grounding is a fixed metaphysical relation or a practice that can be shaped and revised.

  POSITION: Defends feasibility of conceptual engineering through dual content view, challenging meta-semantic pessimism about meaning revision.

  pages = {2649--2677},
  doi = {10.1007/s10670-021-00447-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues conceptual engineering requires clarity about what concepts are. Surveys competing views: concepts as mental representations, as meanings, as abilities, as abstract objects. Each conception has different implications for what conceptual engineering can accomplish and how. Isaac argues for a pluralist approach: different conceptions of concepts are appropriate for different engineering projects. The paper systematically explores how meta-semantic and metaphysical commitments about concepts constrain engineering methodology.

  RELEVANCE: Makes explicit how meta-semantic theory shapes the conceptual engineering debate. If concepts are abstract Fregean senses, engineering looks different than if concepts are mental representations or abilities. For the SGP, this raises the question: what are symbols, and does the answer determine what grounding could mean? A Fregean might see grounding differently than a mentalist or pragmatist. The pluralism Isaac defends suggests grounding questions may not have a single answer.

  POSITION: Pluralist about concepts, arguing different conceptions suit different theoretical and practical purposes in conceptual engineering.

  volume = {50},
  number = {5},
  pages = {594--605},
  doi = {10.1017/can.2020.8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends the "Austerity Framework" for conceptual engineering, which embraces radical externalism: the mechanisms underlying conceptual engineering are inscrutable (too complex and unstable to grasp) and largely beyond our control. Responds to critics who claim internalism would avoid these commitments. Argues that internalists must show (a) there are scrutable, controllable inner states, (b) concepts supervene on them, and (c) the determination relation is itself scrutable and controllable—a tall order Cappelen doubts internalists can meet.

  RELEVANCE: Raises fundamental questions about meta-semantic control and transparency. If Cappelen is right that semantic facts are inscrutable and uncontrollable even for speakers themselves, this suggests the SGP may target an impossible explanatory goal. We cannot make semantic facts fully transparent or subject to our control—perhaps symbol grounding is similarly inscrutable. Alternatively, this pessimism might be too strong, and internalist alternatives could show grounding is more tractable.

  POSITION: Radical meta-semantic externalism, emphasizing inscrutability and lack of control in semantic determination.

  volume = {119},
  number = {473},
  pages = {103--141},
  doi = {10.1093/mind/fzp137},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Investigates the distinction between fundamental truths (really or metaphysically true) and derivative truths (true but less fundamental). Develops a rigorous theory showing this distinction is not itself a metaphysical distinction but a device presupposed to express metaphysical distinctions. Drawing on Rayo's anti-Quinean views on ontological commitment, Williams formulates a formal theory of fundamentality. Shows how this dovetails with interpretationist meta-semantics to give content to the idea that some entities (sets, mereological sums) can be "postulated into existence."

  RELEVANCE: Raises deep questions about levels of semantic explanation. If some truths are fundamental and others derivative, perhaps some semantic facts are fundamental (grounded in usage, intentions, causal connections) while others are derivative (constructed through interpretation or convention). This could reframe the SGP: symbol grounding might be derivative rather than fundamental, grounded in more basic practices of symbol use. The interpretationist meta-semantics Williams develops offers an alternative to purely causal or naturalistic grounding.

  POSITION: Interpretationist meta-semantics combined with distinction between fundamental and derivative truth.

  pages = {53--79},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198836568.003.0003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a novel meta-semantic strategy: an "endogenous" account where word types are fixed as part of meta-semantics rather than presupposed. Conventions of truthfulness and trust ground not only word meanings (meaning by convention) but also what the word type is for each token utterance (words by convention). The same treatment extends to identifying populations through which conventions prevail. Argues this does not create new underdetermination problems for meta-semantics, contrary to what might be expected.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the typical meta-semantic assumption that word types are part of the non-semantic base. If both word identities and meanings are conventional, this suggests a more holistic, less foundationalist approach to semantics. For the SGP, this raises whether "symbols" and their "meanings" can both be products of grounding practices rather than one grounding the other. The conventionalist framework might suggest symbol grounding is internally constituted by practices rather than externally determined by causal relations.

  POSITION: Conventionalist meta-semantics with endogenous account of word types and populations.

  number = {6},
  pages = {1211--1241},
  doi = {10.1007/s10670-015-9791-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Carnapian explication—replacing a vague or unclear concept with a more precise one—as a method of conceptual re-engineering. Distinguishes explication from conceptual analysis (which aims to capture existing meaning) and stipulation (which simply introduces new meaning). Argues explication involves both descriptive and normative elements: it must be similar enough to the explicandum to count as replacing it, but improved enough to serve theoretical purposes. Develops constraints on successful explication and its role in philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: Explication provides a framework for thinking about how symbols could be "grounded" through systematic refinement. Rather than a one-step causal link, grounding might involve iterative explication where vague symbol-world connections are progressively sharpened. This process-oriented view contrasts with snapshot models of reference determination. For the SGP, this suggests grounding might be an ongoing engineering project rather than a fixed metaphysical relation requiring explanation.

  volume = {27},
  number = {3},
  pages = {37--54},
  doi = {10.1387/theoria.3482},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically assesses the "Expertise Defense"—the claim that philosophers' semantic intuitions about reference are more reliable than laypeople's intuitions. Focusing on proper name reference intuitions (Kripkean causal-historical vs. Fregean descriptivist), Machery examines whether philosophical expertise genuinely improves intuition reliability. Finds little empirical evidence supporting the Expertise Defense, raising methodological questions about how semantic theories should be tested and what role intuitions should play in meta-semantic theorizing.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the evidential basis for competing meta-semantic theories. If expert intuitions about reference are no more reliable than folk intuitions, this undermines one methodology for adjudicating between meta-semantic views. For the SGP, this raises: whose intuitions about symbol grounding count? Cognitive scientists', philosophers', AI researchers'? The lack of privileged expert intuitions might explain why grounding debates are so persistent—there's no neutral intuitive ground to stand on.

  doi = {10.1017/9781108698283.008},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes metasemantics (the foundations of semantic meaning) from metapragmatics (the foundations of speaker meaning and communicative intentions). Argues both levels require philosophical analysis. Metasemantics addresses what determines literal linguistic meaning, while metapragmatics addresses what determines what speakers mean by utterances. These interact but should be kept analytically distinct. The paper surveys major metasemantic theories and argues for their independence from semantic theories proper.

  RELEVANCE: The metasemantics/metapragmatics distinction could illuminate the SGP. Perhaps the grounding problem conflates semantic grounding (what makes symbols have meanings) with pragmatic grounding (what makes symbol uses mean things). If so, different solutions might apply at each level. Conventional symbols might be semantically grounded one way (e.g., in community practices) while pragmatically grounded another way (e.g., in speaker intentions). This distinction might dissolve apparent grounding puzzles.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a Fregean approach to metasemantics centered on "aboutness"—what expressions are about. Argues metasemantics asks after the determinants of semantic endowment: what makes expressions have their semantic significance? Defends a view where aboutness is prior to reference and truth-conditions. Semantic values are structured in ways that reflect cognitive significance, not just referential relations. This Fregean metasemantics contrasts with Russellian views where reference is fundamental.

  RELEVANCE: Offers an alternative to referentialist approaches that might undergird the SGP. If semantics is fundamentally about aboutness rather than reference, symbol grounding might concern what symbols are about rather than what they refer to—a potentially different question. Aboutness might be grounded in cognitive roles or inferential patterns rather than causal-referential connections. This could reframe the SGP as asking the wrong question by presupposing referential semantics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "temporal externalism"—the view that assertion and belief content is determined partly by facts about other times, including future times. This metasemantic account handles disagreement and retraction data that motivates relativist semantics, but without relativism's controversial commitments. Speaker behaviors like retracting previous assertions play a role in making past utterances have their meanings. Challenges the assumption that utterance meaning is fixed at time of utterance.

  RELEVANCE: Radically reconceptualizes how content gets determined, extending externalism temporally. For the SGP, this suggests symbol grounding might not be temporally local—what grounds a symbol's meaning might include future practices and dispositions, not just past causal history or current usage. This challenges static pictures of grounding and suggests meaning determination is more dynamic and holistic than the SGP might assume.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Cappelen's claim that internalist metasemantics fares no better than externalism regarding scrutability and control in conceptual engineering. Argues internalist conceptual role theories of content can meet Cappelen's challenge by showing: (a) there are scrutable, controllable inner states (conceptual roles), (b) contents supervene on these, and (c) the determination relation is scrutable and controllable. Defends internalism as providing more tractable foundations for conceptual engineering than externalism.

  RELEVANCE: Bears directly on whether symbol grounding can be understood internalistically. If Pollock succeeds in defending internalist metasemantics, this suggests symbol meanings could be grounded in internal conceptual roles rather than external causal-referential relations—potentially offering a different solution space for the SGP. However, if Cappelen is right that internalism fails to deliver scrutability and control, grounding might be inscrutable from both internalist and externalist perspectives.
