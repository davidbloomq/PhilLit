## Meta-Semantic Frameworks and the Grounding Question

The symbol grounding problem does not arise in a theoretical vacuum. Its very formulation presupposes particular views about what meaning is and what makes semantic facts obtain. This section applies the apparatus of philosophy of language to evaluate whether the SGP tacitly assumes a narrow meta-semantic framework and whether alternative theories of meaning would generate different diagnostic verdicts. The central thesis is that the grounding problem appears most pressing under referentialist semantics, where meaning fundamentally involves word-world relations, but may dissolve or transform under inferentialist or use-theoretic alternatives that locate meaning in intralinguistic relations or practical competence.

### Referentialism and the Naturalness of Grounding

Direct reference theory, as developed through the Kripke-Donnellan revolution, holds that proper names and natural kind terms refer directly to objects via causal-historical chains rather than through associated descriptive content (Kripke 1980; Donnellan 1966). On this view, the name "Aristotle" refers to a particular individual not because speakers associate it with descriptions like "the teacher of Alexander," but because current uses are causally connected to an initial dubbing of that individual. Reference is established through chains of linguistic transmission tracing back to perceptual encounters with referents.

This framework makes symbol grounding appear both natural and necessary. If meaning fundamentally involves causal connections between symbols and the entities they denote, then computational symbols face an obvious challenge: they lack the requisite causal history linking them to worldly referents. Harnad's original formulation implicitly assumes something like this picture when requiring that symbols connect to "non-symbolic" sensorimotor representations (Harnad 1990). The grounding problem becomes urgent precisely because symbols in purely computational systems are causally isolated from the objects they purportedly represent.

Contemporary defenders of causal-historical semantics have explicitly connected this framework to the grounding debate. Devitt (2020) argues that reference is determined by causal-historical networks connecting terms to objects, providing a naturalistic metasemantic foundation. If this account is correct, then the SGP correctly identifies a genuine semantic requirement: symbols must be causally grounded to have determinate reference. Bielecka (2015) makes this connection explicit, arguing that proposed solutions to the SGP fail by their own standards because they cannot establish the causal connections that reference requires.

However, referentialist semantics faces its own well-known challenges that complicate its role in grounding debates. Distinguishing semantically appropriate causal chains from deviant ones remains difficult, and the framework struggles with abstract objects lacking causal profiles (Burgess and Sherman 2014). If reference to mathematical entities or fictional characters cannot proceed through causal chains, then causal grounding may not capture the full scope of semantic competence. These limitations suggest the SGP may inherit unresolved problems from the referentialist framework it presupposes.

### Inferentialism and Meaning Without Denotation

Brandomian inferentialism offers a radically different picture of semantic constitution. On this view, conceptual content is not fundamentally about word-world relations but is constituted by inferential roles in practices of giving and asking for reasons (Brandom 1994). Meaning is position in the "space of reasons"—the patterns of commitment and entitlement that govern how expressions can be used in reasoning. To understand a concept is to master its inferential articulation: knowing what follows from applying it, what warrants its application, and what it is incompatible with.

This framework has profound implications for the grounding problem. If meaning is inferential role rather than denotation, then symbols become meaningful through their position in networks of inference rather than through connections to non-symbolic reality. The SGP's demand that symbols be "grounded" in sensorimotor representations appears misguided—it asks for the wrong kind of semantic foundation. As Peregrin (2014) clarifies, inferentialism treats meaning as constituted by inferential rules governing expression use, making reference derivative rather than constitutive of content.

A natural objection is that inferentialism cannot accommodate the intuition underlying the SGP—that language must somehow connect to the world. Brandom (2010) directly addresses this concern, arguing that inferentialist semantics is compatible with world-directedness without reducing meaning to reference. Observational concepts gain their content through their role in perceptual judgments, but this role is itself inferentially articulated. The world shapes our inferential practices through perception and action, but the semantic content of concepts remains their inferential significance. Grounding becomes a matter of how inferential practices are causally sustained, not a requirement that symbols directly connect to referents.

Contemporary work has begun applying inferentialist frameworks to artificial systems. Arai and Tsugawa (2024) argue that Brandomian semantics provides a better foundation for understanding large language models than referentialist alternatives. LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties, processing language through inference and substitution patterns without requiring reference to external world representations. If inferentialism captures how LLMs achieve semantic competence, this suggests the SGP presupposes a referentialist picture that may not apply to all meaning-bearing systems. Carter, Collin, and Palermos (2016) note that inferentialism entails a form of active externalism where meaning is constituted by extended inferential practices, suggesting that grounding might be about embedding in practices rather than individual symbol-object links.

### Use Theories and the Wittgensteinian Alternative

Use-theoretic accounts of meaning, tracing to Wittgenstein's later philosophy, propose that meaning is constituted by rule-governed participation in language games rather than by reference to objects or mental representations (Griffin 2020; Kamota and Ndemo 2024). To understand a word is to know how to use it—to have mastered the practices governing its employment in linguistic and practical activities. Meaning is thus not a relation between symbol and referent but a capacity for appropriate use within a form of life.

This framework generates a distinctive diagnosis of the grounding problem. Gubelmann (2024) argues explicitly that the SGP arises only if one adopts the computational theory of mind or referentialist semantics. Under pragmatic, use-based theories, the problem dissolves: symbols become meaningful through participation in normative linguistic practices, not through perceptual anchoring or reference to external objects. If LLMs participate in language games governed by pragmatic norms—responding appropriately, following conversational conventions, producing contextually fitting outputs—they may satisfy the conditions for meaning that use theories specify.

However, Wittgensteinian approaches also reveal demanding requirements that computational systems may fail to meet. Bottazzi and Ferrario (2025) develop a sophisticated critique based on "constancy"—the capacity to maintain reference points through agreement in definitions and judgments across dialogue turns. Genuine communication requires tracking commitments and detecting contradictions throughout extended exchanges, capacities they argue LLMs lack. The appearance of understanding arises from what they call "bewitchment": humans follow familiar language games while assuming understanding until proven otherwise. This analysis suggests use theories may set higher bars than simple pattern-matching—they demand normatively governed consistency in practice, not merely locally fluent outputs.

The tension between these Wittgensteinian positions reveals important ambiguities in what "use" means. If appropriate use requires only producing contextually suitable responses, LLMs may qualify. If it requires maintaining stable commitments across extended interactions, tracking logical relations, and participating in forms of life involving more than linguistic behavior, the requirements become more demanding. The SGP may not simply dissolve under use theories but transform into questions about what aspects of use are constitutive of meaning.

### Contemporary Meta-Semantics and Grounding

Recent meta-semantic theory provides refined tools for analyzing the SGP's presuppositions. Meta-semantics asks what makes semantic facts obtain—a question distinct from what semantic facts there are (Burgess and Sherman 2014). This distinction reveals that the SGP operates at the meta-semantic level, asking what grounds symbol meaning, but rarely makes its meta-semantic commitments explicit.

Cohnitz and Haukioja (2025) defend "meta-internalism": the view that foundations of reference are anchored in individual psychological states and dispositions. This might seem to support the SGP's concern with how individual systems ground their symbols. However, they argue meta-internalism is compatible with semantic externalism as usually understood, complicating simple narratives about what grounding requires. The meta-semantic story about why symbols mean what they do may involve factors quite different from what determines their semantic content.

Alternative meta-semantic frameworks suggest different pictures of what the SGP asks. Keiser (2022) proposes that language's essential function is directing attention for achieving social goals rather than transmitting information. If meaning is fundamentally about coordinating attention and action, grounding might concern social embedding rather than perceptual connection to referents. Simchen (2017) develops a Fregean approach centered on "aboutness" rather than reference, where semantic values reflect cognitive significance rather than referential relations. This suggests grounding might concern what symbols are about—their cognitive role—rather than what they denote.

The question of semantic scrutability bears directly on whether the grounding problem can be answered. Cappelen (2020) argues that semantic facts are fundamentally inscrutable: the mechanisms determining meaning are too complex and unstable to grasp. If correct, this suggests the SGP may target an impossible explanatory goal—we cannot make semantic grounding fully transparent even for human language. Pollock (2020) responds that internalist conceptual role theories can meet scrutability requirements, defending the view that internal states provide tractable grounding. This debate reveals that positions on symbol grounding often reflect deeper commitments about whether semantic determination is epistemically accessible.

Taken together, contemporary meta-semantics reveals that the grounding question cannot be answered without first specifying which theory of meaning determination is presupposed. Sogaard (2025) argues that debates about whether LLMs have semantics reflect deeper disagreements about what semantics is rather than merely empirical questions about capabilities. Correspondence theories require reference to world states, coherence theories require internal consistency, and inferentialist theories require patterns of inferential role—each generating different grounding criteria. The SGP's formulation may presuppose correspondence-based semantics, making its grounding requirements appear universal when they are in fact theory-dependent.

This meta-semantic analysis supports the hypothesis that the symbol grounding problem is not a theory-neutral puzzle but a reflection of particular commitments about meaning constitution. Under referentialist frameworks, grounding is central and challenging. Under inferentialist alternatives, it may become peripheral or dissolve into questions about inferential competence. Under use theories, it transforms into questions about practical embedding in normative linguistic practices. The problem's persistence in AI debates may partly reflect the field's unreflective inheritance of referentialist assumptions from the computational theory of mind, rather than identifying a semantic constraint that all theories of meaning would recognize.
