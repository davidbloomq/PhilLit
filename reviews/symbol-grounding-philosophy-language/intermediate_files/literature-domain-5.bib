DOMAIN: Philosophical Critiques of the Symbol Grounding Problem

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The symbol grounding problem (SGP), formulated by Harnad in 1990, asks how
computational symbols can be intrinsically meaningful rather than parasitic on
human interpretation. Philosophical engagement with the SGP reveals deep
disagreements about whether it represents a genuine problem or rests on
confused assumptions about meaning and semantics. Critics argue that the SGP
presupposes a narrow, denotational view of semantics and neglects alternative
theories of meaning (use-based, inferentialist, or pragmatist accounts). A
central debate concerns whether the problem assumes a computational theory of
mind that many philosophers reject. Recent work questions whether the SGP
applies to modern AI systems like LLMs or whether it dissolves when proper
attention is paid to the role of linguistic practice and normativity.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central hypothesis: that the SGP may
presuppose a narrow meta-semantic view. Papers here examine which theoretical
commitments underlie the problem's formulation and whether alternative
frameworks (pragmatism, inferentialism, use theories) render it ill-posed or
solvable. Understanding these critiques is essential to evaluating whether
the SGP identifies a genuine constraint or reflects unexamined semantic
assumptions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is substantial critique of proposed *solutions* to the SGP, there
is less direct philosophical analysis of whether the problem's *formulation*
itself is theoretically coherent. Few papers explicitly connect Wittgensteinian
meaning-as-use perspectives to the SGP debate. Recent AI developments (LLMs,
multimodal models) have prompted new evaluations, but systematic philosophical
engagement with these systems remains limited.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Key tension: Is the SGP a genuine explanatory challenge or does it presuppose
questionable meta-semantic commitments (e.g., that meaning requires causal
grounding in sensory experience, or that semantics is fundamentally
denotational)? Synthesis should trace how different semantic frameworks
(referentialist, inferentialist, pragmatist) generate different attitudes
toward the problem. Consider also whether recent critiques of the SGP's
applicability to LLMs reveal deeper issues with the problem's scope.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- SGP as genuine problem: 6 papers - Harnad's original formulation and
  defenders arguing the problem remains unsolved
- SGP as ill-posed/pseudo-problem: 5 papers - Critics arguing it presupposes
  flawed semantic theories or computational assumptions
- Alternative framings: 4 papers - Attempts to reframe the problem in more
  tractable terms or identify which version deserves attention

  CORE ARGUMENT: The original formulation of the symbol grounding problem.
  Harnad argues that purely symbolic systems face an inherent limitation:
  symbols can only be defined in terms of other symbols (like a
  Chinese/Chinese dictionary), creating an infinite regress unless some
  symbols are grounded in non-symbolic, sensorimotor representations. He
  proposes that hybrid systems combining iconic and categorical representations
  with symbolic processing could ground meaning, drawing analogies to how
  humans learn word meanings through perceptual experience. The paper has
  become foundational to debates about whether AI systems can possess genuine
  semantic understanding.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding the problem this domain critiques.
  Harnad's formulation explicitly presupposes that meaning requires grounding
  in perceptual experience, a meta-semantic commitment that many philosophical
  critics challenge. His reliance on the Chinese Room argument and emphasis on
  sensorimotor grounding reflects particular assumptions about what
  constitutes semantic competence. The paper's influence makes it necessary to
  examine what theoretical framework underlies the problem's original
  statement.

  POSITION: Foundational formulation of the SGP; implicitly assumes a
  referentialist or perceptually-grounded semantic framework.

  volume = {17},
  number = {4},
  pages = {419--445},
  doi = {10.1080/09528130500284053},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews eight proposed strategies for solving the SGP over
  fifteen years and argues that all fail to satisfy the "zero semantical
  commitment condition" (ZSC) - that a genuine solution must not presuppose
  the very semantic abilities it purports to explain. The authors argue that
  most solutions either (1) smuggle in semantic assumptions through the
  designer's intentions, (2) rely on causal correlations that don't constitute
  meaning, or (3) presuppose rather than explain interpretative capacities.
  They propose their own "praxical" solution emphasizing interactive behavior
  in informationally rich environments.

  RELEVANCE: Highly influential critical review that systematizes the debate
  about what counts as a genuine solution versus a pseudo-solution. Their ZSC
  criterion itself embodies particular meta-semantic commitments about what
  meaning requires. Later critiques (Müller, Bielecka) argue that Taddeo and
  Floridi's own solution violates their ZSC, revealing tensions in how the
  problem's constraints are formulated. This demonstrates how different
  semantic frameworks generate incompatible criteria for adequacy.

  POSITION: Critical systematic analysis; proposes stringent criteria for
  solutions but generates controversy about whether those criteria are
  themselves defensible.

  pages = {369--389},
  doi = {10.1007/s11023-007-9081-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a solution to the SGP based on "praxis" - the
  interactive, goal-directed behavior of agents in informationally rich
  environments. Argues that meaning emerges from successful interaction
  patterns rather than from internal representational structures or causal
  connections to referents. An agent grounds symbols by using them
  successfully in adaptive behavior within specific environmental contexts.
  This shifts focus from representational content to functional role in
  practice.

  RELEVANCE: Represents an attempt to solve the SGP by appealing to
  pragmatic, use-based considerations rather than denotational semantics.
  However, critics (Müller, Bielecka) argue this solution still presupposes
  semantic capacities (e.g., goal-directedness, success criteria) that
  themselves require grounding. The tension reveals how different commitments
  about meaning-constitution lead to different judgments about whether the SGP
  has been solved or merely relocated. Connects to broader pragmatist themes
  relevant to the project's hypothesis.

  POSITION: Proposes pragmatic/behavioral solution emphasizing interactive
  success over representational grounding.

  number = {1},
  pages = {73--78},
  doi = {10.1080/0952813X.2014.940143},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that there is no single, well-defined symbol grounding
  problem but rather multiple distinct questions that get conflated. Critiques
  Taddeo and Floridi's "zero semantic commitment" criterion as impossible to
  satisfy even by their own proposed solution. On the basis of a proper
  syntactic understanding of computing, Müller concludes that the only sensible
  formulation of the grounding problem is: how can we explain and reproduce the
  behavioral ability and function of meaning in artificial computational
  agents? This reframes the problem as an engineering challenge about
  replicating semantic functionality rather than a metaphysical puzzle about
  intrinsic meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges whether the SGP is coherently formulated and
  argues that different theoretical commitments about computation and semantics
  generate incompatible versions of the problem. His claim that we should focus
  on reproducing behavioral semantic functions rather than solving a
  metaphysical grounding problem aligns with the project's hypothesis that the
  SGP may rest on narrow meta-semantic assumptions. The paper exemplifies
  philosophical critique of the problem's formulation itself.

  POSITION: Meta-critique arguing the SGP is multiply ambiguous; proposes
  focusing on functional replication rather than metaphysical grounding.

  volume = {27},
  number = {1},
  pages = {79--93},
  doi = {10.1080/0952813X.2014.940138},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides detailed critique of Taddeo and Floridi's praxical
  solution, arguing it fails to satisfy their own zero semantic commitment
  condition. Bielecka contends that concepts like "goal-directedness,"
  "adaptive behavior," and "successful interaction" already presuppose semantic
  and intentional notions that themselves require grounding. The praxical
  solution thus relocates rather than solves the grounding problem. She argues
  that any purely functionalist account will face this difficulty because
  function ascription itself requires interpretative context.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how different meta-semantic commitments lead to
  incompatible judgments about whether proposed solutions succeed. Bielecka's
  critique suggests that the SGP may be intractable if formulated to require
  zero semantic commitment, raising the question of whether this formulation
  itself rests on questionable assumptions. The debate between Taddeo/Floridi
  and their critics exemplifies deeper disagreements about what meaning
  requires and whether computational systems can possess it.

  by their own standards due to hidden semantic presuppositions.

  number = {1},
  pages = {63--72},
  doi = {10.1080/0952813X.2014.940139},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that despite decades of proposed solutions, the SGP
  remains fundamentally unsolved and may be unsolvable for purely computational
  systems. Bringsjord contends that all extant solutions either fail to provide
  genuine grounding (relying instead on external interpretation) or covertly
  presuppose the semantic capacities they aim to explain. He suggests that the
  problem may reveal inherent limitations of the computational approach to mind
  and meaning, vindicating aspects of Searle's Chinese Room argument.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the position that the SGP identifies a genuine and
  perhaps insuperable obstacle to purely computational accounts of meaning.
  This contrasts sharply with critics who argue the problem is ill-posed. The
  debate between those who see the SGP as revealing deep truths about meaning
  and those who see it as resting on confused assumptions is central to
  evaluating whether it presupposes a narrow meta-semantic view. Bringsjord's
  pessimism about computational solutions connects to broader questions about
  the relationship between syntax and semantics.

  POSITION: Defends the SGP as genuine and unsolved; skeptical of
  computational approaches to meaning.

  pages = {11663--11678},
  doi = {10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.651},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the symbol grounding problem does not apply to
  large language models (LLMs) because the SGP only arises when one adopts
  questionable theories of meaning - specifically, the computational theory of
  mind (CTM) or referentialist semantics. Gubelmann traces the SGP's origins
  to CTM assumptions and argues that if one instead adopts a pragmatic,
  use-based theory of meaning (where meaning is constituted by rule-governed
  linguistic practices), the grounding problem dissolves. LLMs participate in
  linguistic practices governed by pragmatic norms, which is sufficient for
  meaning without requiring perceptual grounding or reference to external
  objects.

  RELEVANCE: Directly supports the project's central hypothesis that the SGP
  presupposes a narrow meta-semantic framework. Gubelmann's argument that the
  problem only arises given CTM or referentialist assumptions exemplifies how
  alternative semantic theories (here, pragmatist/use-based) can render the
  problem ill-posed or irrelevant. The paper's focus on LLMs shows how recent
  AI developments are prompting philosophers to reconsider the SGP's scope and
  theoretical foundations. This is a key contemporary contribution to the
  critique literature.

  POSITION: Recent critique arguing the SGP presupposes questionable semantic
  theories and dissolves under pragmatist frameworks.

  doi = {10.1007/s11023-011-9263-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Revisits the SGP by examining what conditions are necessary
  and sufficient for artificial agents to possess meaningful representations.
  Argues that previous formulations conflate different notions of meaning
  (reference, content, function) and that clarifying these distinctions reveals
  that some versions of the grounding problem are more tractable than others.
  Proposes that grounding should be understood in terms of causal-functional
  roles within agent-environment systems rather than requiring sensorimotor
  experience per se.

  RELEVANCE: Represents an attempt to clarify the SGP by distinguishing
  different semantic notions that get conflated in standard formulations. This
  analytical approach aligns with the project's interest in examining what
  meta-semantic commitments underlie the problem. The paper's emphasis on
  causal-functional roles versus sensorimotor grounding reflects different
  views about what semantic competence requires, relevant to assessing whether
  Harnad's formulation presupposes an unnecessarily narrow framework.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews the SGP specifically in the context of autonomous
  robotics and embodied AI. Argues that for autonomous agents, the grounding
  problem takes on a different character than for purely computational systems
  because physical robots have genuine causal interactions with their
  environments. However, the authors contend that even embodied systems face
  challenges in establishing intrinsic rather than observer-relative semantics.
  They conclude that the problem remains unsolved but may be more tractable for
  embodied agents than for disembodied computational systems.

  RELEVANCE: Connects the SGP to embodied cognition and robotics, showing how
  the problem's formulation and tractability depends on what kind of system is
  under consideration. The embodied AI perspective suggests that Harnad's
  emphasis on sensorimotor grounding may be more defensible for robots than for
  pure language systems. This raises questions about whether the SGP is really
  a family of distinct problems depending on system architecture, relevant to

  pages = {108},
  doi = {10.3390/philosophies7050108},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that attempts to solve the SGP by dividing it into
  "hard" and "easy" problems (analogous to consciousness studies) are
  misguided because this strategy risks categorizing everything difficult as
  "hard" and thus irresolvable. Instead proposes viewing the SGP as
  fundamentally about how AI systems can have intentionality. Suggests that the
  problem should be reframed in terms of how systems can develop genuine
  goal-directedness and aboutness rather than merely manipulating meaningless
  symbols.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a recent philosophical perspective on how to productively
  frame the grounding problem. The paper's critique of hard/easy problem
  divisions and its emphasis on intentionality connects to broader debates
  about what makes mental or computational states meaningful. The reframing in
  terms of intentionality rather than sensorimotor grounding reflects different
  meta-semantic commitments about what meaning fundamentally involves, relevant
  to the project's investigation of the SGP's theoretical assumptions.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a theoretical framework for understanding AI
  capabilities along three dimensions: self-learning, generalization, and
  semantic grounding. Argues that the symbol grounding problem represents one
  axis of this state space but should be understood alongside other dimensions
  of AI competence. The paper connects classical philosophical issues (Chinese
  Room, SGP, use theories of meaning) to contemporary AI architectures and
  capabilities, arguing for a multidimensional rather than binary conception of
  artificial intelligence.

  RELEVANCE: Provides conceptual framework situating the SGP within a broader
  space of AI capabilities and philosophical issues. By treating semantic
  grounding as one dimension among others, Lyre's approach questions whether
  the SGP should be seen as a singular, foundational problem or as one aspect
  of a more complex space of challenges. This meta-theoretical perspective is
  relevant to assessing whether the problem's standard formulation appropriately
  captures what matters for artificial semantic competence.

  pages = {55--60},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the SGP's implications for AI research, arguing that
  the problem reveals fundamental limitations of the symbolic AI paradigm that
  dominated early artificial intelligence. Mayo contends that the grounding
  problem demonstrates why purely symbolic systems cannot achieve genuine
  understanding and why AI research needed to incorporate sub-symbolic,
  connectionist, or embodied approaches. However, he argues that even these
  alternatives may not fully solve the problem, as they face their own
  challenges in establishing intrinsic meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Represents an earlier (pre-LLM) assessment of the SGP's
  implications for AI architecture choices. Mayo's analysis connects the
  grounding problem to the symbolic/connectionist debate in AI, showing how
  meta-theoretical commitments about representation and computation shape
  judgments about which systems can possess meaning. This historical
  perspective helps contextualize how the problem has been understood across
  different AI paradigms, relevant to understanding its theoretical
  presuppositions.

  doi = {10.3758/s13423-015-0825-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that embodied cognition theories, which attempt to
  ground meaning in sensorimotor experience, face serious challenges when
  accounting for abstract concepts that lack clear perceptual referents (e.g.,
  "justice," "democracy," "infinity"). Dove identifies three "ungrounding
  problems" for abstract concepts: (1) how they can be represented without
  sensorimotor content, (2) how they relate to concrete concepts, (3) how
  language might provide an alternative grounding. He suggests that purely
  embodied approaches are insufficient and that linguistic/symbolic
  representation plays an irreducible role.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on embodied cognition rather than AI, Dove's
  argument is highly relevant to assessing whether sensorimotor grounding
  (Harnad's proposed solution) can account for the full range of human
  semantic competence. If abstract concepts require linguistic grounding, this
  suggests that Harnad's framework may be too narrow, supporting the project's
  hypothesis that the SGP presupposes particular assumptions about how meaning
  works. The paper shows that the grounding question extends beyond AI to human
  cognition.

  grounding insufficient for abstract concepts; suggests linguistic grounding
  necessary.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a formal framework to clarify different versions of

  distinct problems that apply to different representational architectures.

  by classifying representational systems. This meta-theoretical work is
  relevant to understanding what assumptions different formulations of the
  problem make about representation and meaning. By showing that the grounding

  arxivId = {2512.09117},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents a formal categorical framework for analyzing how
  humans and LLMs transform content into truth-evaluated propositions about
  possible worlds. Argues that LLMs do not solve but rather circumvent the
  symbol grounding problem by operating at a different level of semantic
  processing. While humans ground symbols in perceptual experience and world
  interaction, LLMs generate contextually appropriate linguistic outputs
  without such grounding, effectively bypassing the need for it through
  statistical patterns in language use. This circumvention is functionally
  adequate for many tasks even if philosophically distinct from genuine
  grounding.

  RELEVANCE: Most recent (2025) philosophical analysis of LLMs and the SGP,
  offering a formal framework for understanding how modern AI systems relate to
  the grounding problem. Floridi's argument that LLMs circumvent rather than
  solve the problem represents a middle position between those claiming LLMs
  ground symbols and those denying they have any semantic competence. The
  categorical framework and emphasis on different levels of semantic processing
