## Research Gaps and Contemporary Reconsideration

The preceding analysis reveals that philosophical engagement with the symbol grounding problem has been uneven: extensive within cognitive science and AI, but surprisingly limited within philosophy of language proper. Four significant gaps emerge from this literature, each reflecting the unexamined theoretical assumptions that have shaped the debate.

### Gap 1: Systematic Analysis of the SGP's Meta-Semantic Presuppositions

Despite decades of discussion, remarkably few papers systematically examine which theory of meaning the symbol grounding problem presupposes. Muller (2015) argues there is no single, well-defined SGP but rather multiple distinct questions that become conflated depending on one's theoretical commitments about computation and semantics. His diagnosis suggests that participants in grounding debates often talk past each other because they implicitly adopt incompatible frameworks. More recently, Gubelmann (2024) contends that the SGP only arises when one accepts the computational theory of mind combined with referentialist semantics; under pragmatist alternatives, the problem dissolves rather than demands solution.

Yet systematic meta-semantic analysis remains rare. Sogaard (2025) demonstrates that verdicts about whether LLMs possess semantics depend heavily on which semantic theory one adopts---correspondence, coherence, inferentialist, or deflationary---suggesting that grounding debates reflect deeper disagreements about what semantics is rather than purely empirical questions about system capabilities. This theoretical pluralism has not been adequately mapped onto the SGP literature. Bielecka (2015), while critiquing proposed solutions, does not examine whether the problem's formulation itself embeds contestable assumptions. The gap is significant: without clarity about which semantic framework makes the SGP cogent, researchers cannot determine whether they face a genuine explanatory challenge or a theory-laden pseudo-problem.

### Gap 2: Inferentialist and Use-Theoretic Responses to the SGP

Philosophy of language offers sophisticated alternatives to referentialist semantics, yet these frameworks remain underdeployed in grounding debates. Brandom's (1994, 2010) normative inferentialism holds that conceptual content is constituted by inferential role in practices of giving and asking for reasons. On this view, symbols acquire meaning through their position in inferential networks, not through connections to non-symbolic reality. Peregrin (2014) clarifies that if meaning is inferential rules rather than world-reference, the grounding problem transforms into a question about acquiring appropriate inferential competencies---a different kind of challenge than Harnad's formulation suggests.

Direct application of inferentialism to the SGP is strikingly rare. Arai and Tsugawa (2024) represent a recent exception, arguing that Brandomian inferential semantics provides a better foundation for understanding LLMs than traditional distributional or representational semantics. They contend that LLMs exhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties: processing language through inference, substitution, and anaphora patterns without requiring reference to external world representations. This suggests the SGP's focus on denotation may be misplaced. Similarly, Wittgensteinian use theories, defended by Kamota and Ndemo (2024) and applied to AI by Griffin (2020), imply that symbols become meaningful through rule-governed participation in language games rather than perceptual anchoring. Bottazzi and Ferrario (2025) develop this perspective, emphasizing that genuine linguistic competence requires "constancy" in maintaining reference points through agreement in both definitions and judgments---a pragmatic criterion that differs markedly from sensorimotor grounding requirements.

The gap here is not merely scholarly but consequential. If inferentialist or use-theoretic frameworks dissolve the SGP, then decades of research seeking solutions may have pursued a misformulated problem. Conversely, if these frameworks merely relocate rather than dissolve grounding requirements, this would vindicate the problem's significance while transforming its content.

### Gap 3: Disambiguation of "Grounding" Across Dimensions

The SGP literature often treats grounding as a unitary phenomenon: symbols either are or are not grounded. Contemporary work reveals this binary framing as misleading. Lyre (2024) proposes a three-dimensional framework distinguishing functional grounding (behavioral success in tasks), social grounding (normative correctness in linguistic practices), and causal grounding (development of world models through environmental interaction). On this analysis, LLMs exhibit grounding along all three dimensions to varying degrees, making simple yes-or-no verdicts inadequate.

Quigley and Maynard (2025) develop this insight further, identifying six grounding dimensions indexed by evaluation context, meaning type, and reference distribution: authenticity, preservation, correlational faithfulness, etiological faithfulness, robustness, and compositionality. Their framework reveals that LLMs show strong correlational faithfulness for linguistic tasks but lack etiological warrant for world-directed tasks without grounded interaction. This multidimensional analysis suggests that the original SGP conflates distinct requirements that may be satisfied independently.

Dove (2024) reinforces this point from a different angle, arguing that human cognition itself combines embodied grounding with linguistic "ungrounded cognition"---genuine cognitive content not requiring direct sensorimotor grounding. LLMs reveal language as a source of semantic information that can scaffold and extend cognitive capacities without full perceptual anchoring. The gap revealed here is not merely taxonomic: without disambiguating grounding dimensions, participants cannot determine which grounding requirements are necessary for which semantic capacities, leaving the debate irresolvable at the level of generality at which it has typically been conducted.

### Gap 4: The SGP's Applicability to Large Language Models

Perhaps the most contested contemporary question is whether the SGP applies to LLMs at all, and if so, what verdict it delivers. Sharp disagreement persists. Harnad (2023), the problem's original formulator, maintains that while LLMs perform surprisingly well due to "benign biases" inherent in language at scale, they lack direct sensorimotor grounding connecting words to referents. Their success reflects the nature of language itself---its redundancy, context-sensitivity, compositional structure---rather than genuine understanding.

Against this, Chalmers (2024) argues that "pure thinkers" capable of thought without sensation are possible in principle, challenging the assumption that sensorimotor grounding is constitutive of meaning rather than merely facilitating it. If Chalmers is correct, Harnad's formulation presupposes an unnecessarily strong empiricist thesis. Floridi, Jia, and Tohme (2025) stake out a middle position using category theory: LLMs neither solve nor fail the SGP but rather circumvent it through a fundamentally different semantic architecture. Their formal analysis suggests LLMs operate in a parallel semantic space, generating contextually appropriate outputs without the grounding that characterizes human meaning-making. Milliere and Buckner (2024) provide comprehensive review showing that many classical objections to neural networks---lack of compositionality, inability to learn language structure, absence of systematic semantic competence---no longer clearly apply to modern LLMs, forcing reconsideration of what grounding requires.

This disagreement is illuminating precisely because different theoretical commitments yield different verdicts. Those maintaining referentialist assumptions find LLMs ungrounded; those adopting inferentialist or pragmatist frameworks find the grounding question transformed or dissolved. LLMs thus serve as crucial test cases revealing which meta-semantic assumptions drive the debate.

## Conclusion

This review has argued that the symbol grounding problem, as traditionally formulated, presupposes specific meta-semantic commitments that philosophers of language have contested. Three central findings emerge from the analysis.

First, the SGP's demand that symbols be "grounded" in non-symbolic reality reflects referentialist or denotational assumptions about meaning---assumptions that inferentialist, use-theoretic, and pragmatist frameworks reject or substantially modify. The problem appears most pressing when one presupposes that meaning fundamentally consists in word-world reference relations and that symbols lacking such relations cannot possess intrinsic semantic content. Under alternative frameworks where meaning is constituted by inferential role, participation in language games, or normative patterns of use, the grounding requirement transforms or dissolves. The SGP is not theory-neutral but theory-laden.

Second, philosophers of language have not systematically engaged with the SGP despite possessing relevant theoretical resources. Brandom's inferentialism, Wittgensteinian use theories, and contemporary meta-semantics all bear directly on whether grounding is a genuine semantic requirement, yet explicit connections remain underdeveloped. This disciplinary gap has allowed the SGP to be treated as a technical problem in cognitive science rather than a philosophical puzzle requiring meta-semantic analysis.

Third, contemporary LLM debates have inadvertently revealed the SGP's theoretical assumptions by generating radically different verdicts depending on one's semantic framework. Participants who deny LLMs possess understanding typically presuppose referentialist grounding requirements; those who attribute understanding often adopt inferentialist or use-theoretic alternatives. The disagreement is not purely empirical but reflects deeper commitments about what meaning requires.

The research contribution emerging from this analysis is both diagnostic and constructive. Diagnostically, it demonstrates that the symbol grounding problem's cogency depends on prior meta-semantic commitments that deserve explicit examination rather than tacit assumption. Constructively, it identifies four gaps where philosophical work is needed: systematic analysis of the SGP's presuppositions, development of inferentialist and use-theoretic responses, disambiguation of grounding dimensions, and careful assessment of whether and how the problem applies to modern AI systems. Addressing these gaps would transform the grounding debate from an unresolved technical challenge into a substantive philosophical inquiry about the nature of meaning and the conditions under which computational systems can possess it.
