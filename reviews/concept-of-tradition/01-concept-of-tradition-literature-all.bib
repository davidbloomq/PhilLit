DOMAIN: Philosophical Foundations and Conceptual Analysis
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses foundational philosophical analyses of tradition as a
concept. The literature reveals several key debates: (1) the necessary and
sufficient conditions for distinguishing tradition from related concepts like
custom, convention, habit, and practice; (2) the role of temporality, continuity,
and transmission in constituting traditions; and (3) the relationship between
tradition and rationality, authority, and innovation. Three major positions emerge:
conservative approaches that emphasize tradition's authority and continuity (Burke,
Oakeshott, Shils); hermeneutic approaches that view tradition as the condition
of understanding (Gadamer, Ricoeur); and critical approaches that examine tradition's
role in power and legitimation (Arendt, MacIntyre). Recent work (Beckstein 2016,
Jacobs 2007) attempts systematic conceptual analysis, addressing tensions between
tradition's static (continuity) and dynamic (living) aspects.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These foundational analyses are essential for establishing clear conceptual
boundaries for the research project. They provide the philosophical vocabulary
and distinctions needed to compare how different disciplinary literatures
(political philosophy, sociology, political science) define and operationalize
the concept of tradition. The debate over "living traditions" (Beckstein 2016)
directly addresses how traditions can change while remaining the same, a core
puzzle for understanding tradition's role in political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is rich literature on tradition in hermeneutic and conservative
political philosophy, there is surprisingly little systematic conceptual analysis
in analytic philosophy. The relationship between tradition and social ontology
(collective intentionality, group agency) remains under-theorized. Few works
explicitly compare tradition to related concepts like convention or practice in
detail.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize synthesis around three axes: (1) definitional criteria (what makes
something a tradition?); (2) ontological status (what kind of thing is a tradition?);
(3) normative significance (what authority do traditions possess?). Use Beckstein
(2016) and Shils (1981) as anchors for systematic conceptual analysis, then map
other positions onto this framework.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Conservative accounts (8 papers): Tradition as authoritative inheritance
- Hermeneutic accounts (6 papers): Tradition as condition of understanding
- Critical accounts (4 papers): Tradition as contested and constructed

DOMAIN: Conservative Political Philosophy and Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 6, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the role of tradition in conservative political thought from Edmund Burke through Michael Oakeshott to contemporary conservatives. The literature reveals two major strands. First, historical scholarship demonstrates that "Burkean conservatism" as a coherent tradition is itself a relatively recent intellectual construction, emerging primarily between 1830-1914 (Jones 2017, Bourke 2018). Burke was a Whig reformer, not a conservative ideologue, and his elevation to "founder of conservatism" reflects later political needs rather than historical accuracy. Second, twentieth-century conservative thought developed sophisticated defenses of tradition's epistemic and normative authority, particularly through Oakeshott's conception of tradition as practical knowledge and MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality. Contemporary conservatives like Scruton continue this project, arguing for tradition's role in transmitting embodied wisdom and sustaining social cohesion.

The debate centers on whether tradition represents accumulated practical wisdom that should constrain abstract rationalism (the conservative view) or whether appeals to tradition mask arbitrary power and obstruct progressive reform (the critical view). MacIntyre's work is particularly significant as it attempts to reconcile tradition with rational inquiry, arguing that all rationality is tradition-constituted yet traditions can rationally evaluate themselves and engage other traditions.

Recent scholarship increasingly questions whether there is a unified "conservative tradition" at all, noting fundamental differences between Burke's historical situatedness, Oakeshott's philosophical conservatism, and MacIntyre's Thomistic Aristotelianism. The literature also reveals tensions between tradition as descriptive inheritance versus tradition as normative authority.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for understanding how political philosophy conceptualizes tradition as a source of political authority and practical wisdom, contrasting sharply with progressive and liberal frameworks that privilege individual autonomy and rational reconstruction. Conservative defenses of tradition provide the most sustained philosophical arguments for tradition's normative force, making this literature indispensable for any comprehensive study of the concept.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature focuses heavily on Anglophone conservatism and relatively neglects continental conservative traditions (e.g., de Maistre, Maurras). There is also limited engagement with how conservative conceptions of tradition handle internal diversity, contestation, and change within traditions themselves. The relationship between conservative political philosophy and sociology of tradition (Nisbet, Shils) remains underexplored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish carefully between (1) Burke's actual views versus the "Burkean tradition" constructed later, (2) Oakeshott's philosophical conservatism versus partisan political conservatism, and (3) MacIntyre's complex position that defends tradition while critiquing both liberalism and many forms of conservatism. Pay attention to how these thinkers define tradition differently and offer distinct arguments for its authority.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical revisionism (Jones, Bourke): 5 papers - Burke was not a conservative; the tradition is a belated construction
- Oakeshottian conservatism: 3 papers - Tradition as practical knowledge, skepticism of rationalism
- MacIntyrean tradition-constituted rationality: 6 papers - Tradition as framework for rational inquiry
- Contemporary conservative defenses (Scruton): 3 papers - Tradition as embodied wisdom, cultural continuity

DOMAIN: Liberal and Critical Perspectives on Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 7, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses liberal, progressive, and critical theoretical perspectives
that question, critique, or seek to transform tradition. It includes Enlightenment
rationalism's critique of tradition as obstacle to reason and progress; the Frankfurt
School's analysis of tradition and authority (Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas); feminist
critiques of tradition as patriarchal inheritance; and liberal arguments for
subordinating tradition to rational justification and individual autonomy.

The key positions span from Enlightenment thinkers who viewed tradition as
"prejudice" requiring critical scrutiny, to Frankfurt School theorists who analyzed
how tradition serves ideological functions under capitalism, to feminist scholars
who critique tradition as vehicle of patriarchal oppression while sometimes
rehabilitating counter-traditions. Recent work explores how these critical perspectives
intersect with postcolonial theory, care ethics, and debates over liberal autonomy.

Major debates include: the relationship between critique and tradition (can critique
function without traditional resources?); whether liberal autonomy requires rejection
of tradition or can accommodate it; how feminist critique navigates between rejecting
patriarchal traditions and affirming women's counter-traditions; and whether critical
theory's Enlightenment inheritance limits its emancipatory potential.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for understanding how tradition has been theorized as an
obstacle to human emancipation and rational progress. It provides the critical
counterpoint to conservative and communitarian defenses of tradition, showing how
tradition can function as ideology, domination, and patriarchal control. These
perspectives are crucial for mapping the full conceptual landscape of tradition
in contemporary political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Frankfurt School perspectives are well-represented, there is limited coverage
of second and third-generation critical theorists beyond Habermas. Additionally,
intersectional feminist critiques that combine race, class, and gender analyses
of tradition could be stronger. The relationship between liberal critique and
non-Western traditions also merits further investigation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, emphasize how critical perspectives reveal the
power dimensions embedded in tradition. Highlight the tension between critique
as an Enlightenment inheritance and critique of the Enlightenment tradition itself.
Consider how feminist scholars navigate this tension by both critiquing patriarchal
traditions and affirming alternative genealogies. The Frankfurt School's immanent
critique methodology offers important resources for thinking about tradition
critically while acknowledging critique's own situatedness.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment Rationalism: 4 papers - Tradition as prejudice requiring critical examination
- Frankfurt School Critical Theory: 5 papers - Tradition as ideological formation under capitalism
- Feminist Critique: 6 papers - Tradition as patriarchal while recovering counter-traditions
- Liberal Autonomy: 3 papers - Tradition subordinated to individual rational choice

DOMAIN: Social Ontology of Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 12 total (High: 5, Medium: 5, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain investigates how tradition functions as a social phenomenon,
addressing its ontological status, mechanisms of transmission and
maintenance, sources of authority, and relationship to collective agency
and identity. The literature reveals four main theoretical positions:
(1) Collective intentionality accounts (Gilbert, Tuomela, Searle) that
ground tradition in shared intentions and we-attitudes; (2) Practice-based
approaches (Schatzki, MacIntyre) that see tradition as constituted by
socially organized activities; (3) Social institutional theories (Miller,
List & Pettit) that analyze tradition through group agency and collective
responsibility; and (4) Hybrid approaches (Brouwer et al.) that integrate
individual and collective dimensions. The foundational works establish that
tradition cannot be reduced to aggregates of individual beliefs but has
emergent social ontological properties. Recent work explores how traditions
are maintained through ritual practices, material culture, and
intergenerational transmission mechanisms.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the question "What is tradition?" from a
social ontological perspective, establishing that tradition is not merely
an epistemic or normative phenomenon but has distinctive social-ontological
features. The collective intentionality literature illuminates how
traditions are constituted by shared attitudes and commitments among group
members. The practice-based approaches reveal how traditions are embodied
in concrete social activities rather than abstract beliefs. The social
institutional frameworks explain how tradition relates to collective agency,
authority structures, and group identity. This provides the conceptual
infrastructure for understanding tradition as a social entity with its own
ontological status.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited attention to the temporal dimension of tradition—how social
ontological status changes across generations. Few works integrate social
ontology with mechanisms of cultural transmission. Insufficient engagement
with non-Western traditions and Indigenous concepts of collective being.
Little discussion of how digital technologies alter the social ontology of
tradition. The relationship between individual agency and collective
tradition remains undertheorized in most accounts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Key debates center on reductionism vs. emergentism regarding tradition's
social ontological status, and on the priority of individual vs. collective
intentionality. Pay attention to how different theories handle the
persistence of traditions across time and changes in membership. Consider
synthesizing collective intentionality approaches with practice-based
accounts to capture both the mental and material dimensions. The tension
between tradition as constraining and as enabling collective agency warrants
careful analysis.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Collective Intentionality Theory: 4 papers - Tradition grounded in
  shared intentions, joint commitments, and we-mode reasoning
- Practice-Based Social Ontology: 3 papers - Tradition constituted by
  organized social practices with internal standards
- Social Institutional Theory: 3 papers - Tradition as institutional
  structure enabling collective agency and responsibility
- Hybrid/Integrative Approaches: 2 papers - Combining individual and
  collective dimensions

DOMAIN: Sociological Theories of Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Sociological theories of tradition span from classical formulations in Weber's
typology of authority to contemporary debates about tradition in late modernity.
Max Weber's conceptualization of traditional authority as one of three ideal types
of legitimate domination established the foundational framework, distinguishing
tradition-oriented action from rational and charismatic forms. Edward Shils
developed the most systematic sociological theory of tradition in his 1981 book,
arguing that tradition involves the transmission of patterns across generations
and constitutes part of the sacred dimension of society. Eric Hobsbawm and Terence
Ranger challenged essentialist accounts through their "invention of tradition"
thesis, demonstrating how apparently ancient traditions are often modern constructs
serving contemporary political purposes. Anthony Giddens analyzed tradition in the
context of reflexive modernization and post-traditional society, arguing that late
modernity involves the detraditionalization of social life while simultaneously
creating new forms of tradition. Recent scholarship examines the continuing role
of tradition in contemporary society, questioning simplistic narratives of
detraditionalization and exploring how tradition operates under conditions of
globalization and reflexivity.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential sociological frameworks for understanding how
traditions are conceptualized, legitimated, maintained, and transformed in modern
societies. Weber's authority typology, Shils's theory of the sacred, Hobsbawm's
constructivist approach, and Giddens's analysis of post-traditional society offer
competing and complementary perspectives crucial for analyzing the concept of
tradition across political philosophy and social theory.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Weber, Shils, and Giddens receive substantial attention, there is less
contemporary engagement with integrating these classical frameworks with recent
developments in practice theory, social ontology, and cultural sociology. The
relationship between sociological and philosophical accounts of tradition remains
undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the tensions between essentialist and constructivist
approaches to tradition, the role of reflexivity in modern tradition, and how
sociological theories inform broader philosophical debates about the normative
status of tradition.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Weberian authority theory: 8 papers - Traditional authority as hereditary,
  sacred, and contrasted with rational-legal and charismatic forms
- Shils's sacred tradition: 6 papers - Tradition as transmission of sacred
  patterns essential to social integration
- Hobsbawm's invention thesis: 5 papers - Traditions as modern political
  constructs serving legitimation functions
- Giddens's post-traditional society: 4 papers - Reflexive modernization and
  the transformation of tradition in late modernity

DOMAIN: Tradition and Modernity Debates
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 12, Medium: 4, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The tradition-modernity debates represent one of the most significant theoretical and empirical discussions in social theory since the mid-20th century. Classical modernization theory, dominant from the 1950s-1970s, posited a linear trajectory whereby traditional societies would inevitably give way to modern ones, characterized by secularization, rationalization, and the decline of traditional forms of authority and community. This paradigm was fundamentally challenged beginning in the 1980s-1990s by three major theoretical developments: (1) the reflexive modernization thesis of Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens, which argued that modernity itself becomes tradition-like under conditions of reflexivity; (2) the multiple modernities framework of Shmuel Eisenstadt, which demonstrated that non-Western societies develop distinct forms of modernity that incorporate rather than replace traditional elements; and (3) postmodern and postcolonial critiques that rejected the tradition-modernity binary altogether as a product of Eurocentric thinking.

The secularization thesis—a core component of classical modernization theory—predicted the inevitable decline of religion with modernization. However, empirical research since the 1990s has comprehensively challenged this prediction, showing persistent religiosity in modern societies and even religious resurgence in some contexts. This has led to theories of "post-secular society" (Habermas) and recognition that secularization patterns vary significantly across different societal contexts.

Recent scholarship emphasizes the dialectical and contested nature of tradition-modernity relations. Rather than a simple displacement, contemporary analyses focus on: how traditions are reinvented and mobilized in modern contexts; how "post-traditional" societies retain traditional elements in transformed ways; how globalization creates new tensions between local traditions and global modernizing forces; and how the very categories of "tradition" and "modernity" are themselves contested and culturally specific. The debate has moved from essentialist characterizations to processual and relational understandings of both concepts.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to understanding how "tradition" itself is conceptualized in relation to its putative opposite, "modernity." The debates reveal that tradition cannot be understood as a static residue of the past but must be grasped in dynamic relation to processes of social change, modernization, and globalization. This challenges any attempt to define tradition in isolation from its historical and sociological context.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive literature on Western European and North American cases, and growing work on Asian contexts (especially through the multiple modernities framework), there remains relatively limited philosophical engagement with how these sociological debates should inform normative political philosophy. Additionally, the literature would benefit from more systematic engagement with how digital technologies and climate change are reshaping tradition-modernity dynamics.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should emphasize the shift from unilinear modernization narratives to more complex, plural, and dialectical understandings of tradition-modernity relations. Key to this is showing how reflexive modernization, multiple modernities, and postcolonial critiques each challenge but also complement one another. The persistence of tradition in modernity—whether as revival, reinvention, or transformation—should be understood as a central rather than anomalous feature of contemporary societies.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Reflexive Modernization (Beck, Giddens, Lash): 12 papers - Modernity becomes self-reflexive, creating "post-traditional" societies where tradition persists in transformed, chosen forms
- Multiple Modernities (Eisenstadt): 4 papers - Non-Western societies develop distinct modernities incorporating traditional elements rather than converging on Western model
- Secularization Critique: 8 papers - Empirical challenges to secularization thesis showing persistence and transformation of religion in modern societies
- Postcolonial Critique: 3 papers - Rejection of tradition-modernity binary as Eurocentric construction

DOMAIN: Tradition, Rationality, and the Enlightenment
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses the epistemological and normative debates surrounding tradition's relationship to reason, originating with the Enlightenment's critique of tradition as prejudice and authority. The rehabilitation of tradition began with Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy in the 1960s, which argued that prejudice (Vorurteil) and belonging to tradition are necessary conditions for understanding rather than obstacles to it. Gadamer's central claim is that the Enlightenment harbored a "prejudice against prejudice" that obscured tradition's productive role in interpretation and knowledge. MacIntyre developed a parallel account of "tradition-constituted rationality," arguing against liberal Enlightenment universalism and for the idea that rational inquiry is always embedded in particular traditions with their own standards of justification. The Habermas-Gadamer debate crystallized key tensions: Habermas argued that Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition fails to provide critical distance from ideology and power, while Gadamer maintained that Habermas's ideal of ideology-critique presupposes the very hermeneutic understanding he rejects. Recent work has moved beyond this impasse by examining how tradition enables both continuity and critique, and by exploring non-Western conceptions of tradition and rationality.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the research on tradition because it addresses the fundamental epistemological question: Can tradition itself be rational, or does rationality require transcending tradition? The domain illuminates how "tradition" shifted from a term of Enlightenment derision to a legitimate philosophical concept, and how different accounts of tradition-constituted rationality shape debates in political philosophy about authority, legitimacy, and social change.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Gadamer and MacIntyre dominate the literature, there is relatively less attention to non-Western traditions' own accounts of the tradition-reason relationship, and insufficient engagement with how contemporary social movements navigate appeals to tradition versus critique of tradition.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should foreground the Enlightenment critique as the origin point, then trace the hermeneutic and virtue-ethics responses (Gadamer and MacIntyre), followed by critical engagements (Habermas, feminist critiques). The contemporary relevance lies in how debates about tradition-constituted rationality inform current political controversies over authority, reform, and cultural continuity.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment rationalism (Kant et al.): 2 papers - Tradition as prejudice to be overcome by autonomous reason
- Gadamerian hermeneutics: 6 papers - Tradition as enabling condition for understanding; prejudice rehabilitated
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics: 5 papers - Tradition-constituted inquiry as alternative to Enlightenment liberalism
- Critical theory (Habermas): 3 papers - Gadamer's traditionalism lacks critical resources for ideology-critique
- Feminist/postcolonial critiques: 2 papers - Both Enlightenment and traditionalism problematic from marginalized standpoints

DOMAIN: Contemporary Political Theory on Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers (partial), Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Contemporary political theory's engagement with tradition centers on three
major debates. First, liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka, Parekh, Modood)
asks how liberal democracies can accommodate minority cultural and religious
traditions while maintaining commitments to individual rights and equality.
This debate distinguishes between immigrant multiculturalism and minority
nationalism, questioning whether group-differentiated rights undermine or
enhance liberal equality. Second, deliberative democracy theorists (Habermas,
Benhabib, Gutmann) explore how traditional communities participate in
democratic discourse, asking whether deliberation requires bracketing
comprehensive doctrines or can integrate religious and cultural reasoning.
Third, critics of multiculturalism (Barry, Okin, contemporary liberal
nationalists) argue that excessive accommodation of tradition threatens
social cohesion, gender equality, and democratic values. Recent work
increasingly questions whether the "retreat" of multiculturalism signals its
failure or a needed recalibration.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how contemporary political theorists theorize
tradition's role in pluralist democracies. It reveals tensions between
respecting inherited practices and commitments to justice, explores how
tradition functions as a source of group identity and political claims, and
examines when accommodation vs. transformation of tradition is warranted. Key
for understanding how "tradition" operates as a contested political concept
in debates about minority rights, immigration, and democratic legitimacy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with non-Western political traditions beyond multiculturalism
debates. The intersection of tradition with populism and contemporary identity
politics remains under-theorized from a philosophical (vs. empirical) perspective.
More work needed on how digital transformation affects traditional communities'
claims and the concept of tradition itself in political theory.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare liberal multiculturalism's approach to tradition with communitarian
and republican alternatives. Trace how Kymlicka's framework has been criticized
and revised. Note the shift from celebrating diversity (1990s-2000s) to
concerns about integration and social cohesion (2010s-present). Examine how
deliberative democracy offers a procedural response to substantive disagreements
about tradition.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Liberal Multiculturalism: 7 papers - Accommodation of minority traditions
  through group-differentiated rights compatible with liberalism
- Deliberative Democracy: 4 papers - Procedural frameworks for managing
  disagreement about tradition in pluralist contexts
- Critics of Multiculturalism: 4 papers - Excessive accommodation threatens
  liberal values, gender equality, social cohesion
- Decolonial/Postcolonial Critiques: 3 papers - Western liberal frameworks
  inadequate for understanding non-Western traditions and minority claims

  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beckstein provides the most systematic contemporary analysis of tradition,
  arguing that traditions are socially valuable precisely because they are "living"—capable
  of authentic continuation through evolution. He distinguishes traditions from mere customs
  by their claim to continuity with the past and their requirement of explicit transmission.
  The central paradox: traditions must change to remain authentic, yet change threatens
  their identity as the "same" tradition. Beckstein resolves this through criteria for
  authentic continuation: changes must be comprehensible as developments of the tradition's
  core commitments rather than breaks from them.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is foundational for the research project because it offers the most
  detailed contemporary conceptual analysis of tradition. Beckstein's distinction between
  tradition and custom/convention clarifies what conceptual work "tradition" does that other
  concepts cannot. His analysis of "living traditions" directly addresses how traditions can
  be both conservative (maintaining continuity) and dynamic (evolving), a tension central to
  understanding tradition's role in political philosophy. The paper also bridges analytic and
  continental approaches to tradition.

  POSITION: Analytic conceptual analysis with hermeneutic influences. Beckstein argues for
  tradition as a distinct social form characterized by claimed continuity, explicit transmission,
  and capacity for authentic development.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs reconstructs Edward Shils' pioneering theory of tradition from his 1981
  book Tradition. Shils provided the first systematic conceptual treatment of tradition in
  sociology, arguing that tradition encompasses anything handed down or transmitted from the past,
  from beliefs to practices to material objects. Jacobs identifies four perspectives in Shils'
  multifaceted account: pragmatic (tradition as useful inheritance), Burkean (tradition as
  embodied wisdom), veridical (tradition as carrier of truth), and evolutionist (tradition as
  product of selection). Shils emphasized tradition's institutional bearers and typology of
  traditions (personal, societal, cultural, etc.).

  RELEVANCE: Shils' work represents the foundational sociological treatment of tradition and
  directly influences later conceptual analyses (including Beckstein). For a project surveying
  how tradition is defined across disciplines, Shils is essential as the reference point for
  sociological approaches. Jacobs' reconstruction helps clarify Shils' sometimes ambiguous
  definitions and typology. The tension between Shils' broad definition (anything transmitted)
  and narrower definitions (only certain kinds of transmissions) mirrors debates across the
  literature.

  POSITION: Sociological functionalism with conservative sympathies. Shils views tradition as
  central to social order and continuity, emphasizing its positive functions while acknowledging
  its plurality and institutional embedding.

  pages = {187--210},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander compares three major twentieth-century philosophical treatments
  of tradition by Hannah Arendt, Michael Oakeshott, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Each theorist sees
  tradition as central to understanding human existence but diagnoses modernity's problem with
  tradition differently. Arendt views tradition as a broken thread connecting past to present,
  Oakeshott sees tradition as the medium of political activity itself (not an object but a
  mode of engagement), and MacIntyre argues for tradition-constituted rationality where rational
  inquiry always proceeds within and between traditions. These three views represent distinct
  ways of conceiving tradition's relationship to reason and modernity.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis is valuable for the research project because it maps key
  theoretical positions in political philosophy's treatment of tradition. It shows how different
  understandings of tradition track different accounts of modernity, rationality, and political
  life. For a project examining how tradition is conceptualized, Alexander's framework helps
  identify the stakes: is tradition a thing (Arendt), a mode (Oakeshott), or a framework
  (MacIntyre)? These are fundamentally different ontologies with different implications.

  number = {5},
  pages = {581--600},
  doi = {10.1111/EDTH.12135},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Leiviskä argues that Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of tradition is fundamentally
  non-conservative despite its reputation. For Gadamer, tradition is not a body of inherited
  content but the condition of possibility for understanding itself—we always understand from
  within traditions, but this situatedness enables rather than constrains critical reflection.
  Tradition allows reflective reappropriation through encounter with other horizons (including
  the horizons of the past). Leiviskä shows how this connects to Aristotelian phronesis: a
  situated, practical rationality that depends on belonging to traditions while remaining
  critically open.

  RELEVANCE: Gadamer's hermeneutic concept of tradition is one of the most influential in
  twentieth-century philosophy, fundamentally reshaping how tradition is understood in relation
  to reason. For the research project, Gadamer represents the hermeneutic position that tradition
  is not opposed to critical thinking but is its precondition. This contrasts sharply with
  Enlightenment views of tradition as authority to be overcome. Leiviskä's clarification that
  Gadamer's view is non-conservative helps distinguish hermeneutic from conservative approaches.

  interpretation, compatible with critical reflection through encounter with otherness.

  author = {Lewis, David},
  title = {Convention: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {1969},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewis provides the canonical analytic philosophical account of convention,
  defining conventions as solutions to coordination problems that arise from common knowledge
  of mutual expectations. Conventions are arbitrary regularities in behavior that persist
  because everyone expects everyone else to conform and prefers to conform given that expectation.
  Lewis grounds conventions in game-theoretic equilibria and distinguishes them from social
  norms, traditions, and natural laws. Conventions are self-sustaining through mutual expectation
  rather than enforcement or inherent authority.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on convention rather than tradition, Lewis' analysis is crucial
  for conceptually distinguishing these terms. The SEP entry on Convention notes that "convention"
  and "traditional" are often used interchangeably, but Lewis shows they are distinct: conventions
  are arbitrary solutions to coordination problems, while traditions claim non-arbitrary authority
  from the past. This distinction helps clarify what makes tradition a distinct concept. Lewis'
  framework also raises the question: can traditions be understood as conventions? Or do they
  require different conceptual resources?

  POSITION: Analytic philosophy of language and action. Convention as coordination equilibrium

  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Marmor extends Lewis' account of convention while addressing its limitations.
  He argues that conventions are not merely coordination equilibria but are constitutive rules
  that create new forms of activity and social reality. Marmor distinguishes "deep conventions"
  (constitutive rules like chess rules) from "surface conventions" (coordination devices).
  He explores how conventions differ from customs, which are non-arbitrary regularities justified
  by past practice, and from norms, which have moral or rational force independent of conventional
  practice.

  RELEVANCE: Marmor's work is essential for distinguishing convention from related concepts,
  particularly custom and tradition. His account of deep conventions as constitutive (creating
  new possibilities) versus surface conventions as coordinative helps map the conceptual space.
  For the research project, this raises the question: are traditions more like customs (justified
  by past practice) or like deep conventions (constitutive of forms of life)? Marmor's distinction
  between arbitrary conventions and non-arbitrary customs parallels discussions of tradition's
  claimed authority.

  POSITION: Legal and social philosophy extending Lewis. Conventions as constitutive rules
  and coordination devices, distinguished from customs by arbitrariness and from norms by
  dependence on practice.

  title = {On Social Facts},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gilbert develops her influential "plural subject" account of social phenomena,
  arguing that collective phenomena (including conventions, social norms, and group beliefs)
  are constituted by joint commitments. When people form a plural subject, they commit together
  to uphold certain beliefs, intentions, or practices as a body. This joint commitment creates
  obligations and normative expectations that cannot be reduced to individual commitments.
  Gilbert critiques Lewisian accounts of convention as unable to capture the normative force
  and obligation characteristic of many social practices.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject theory is foundational for social ontology and raises
  important questions for understanding tradition. If traditions are social phenomena, do they
  require joint commitments among participants? Or can traditions exist through aggregated
  individual participation without collective commitment? Gilbert's emphasis on normativity
  and obligation in social practices suggests traditions may have a social ontology similar to
  conventions or social norms. For a project on the concept of tradition, Gilbert provides
  conceptual resources for understanding tradition's social reality.

  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Searle provides a systematic account of social ontology, arguing that
  institutional facts (money, property, marriage) are created through collective intentionality
  and constitutive rules of the form "X counts as Y in context C." Social reality is constructed
  through collective recognition and acceptance of status functions. Unlike Gilbert, Searle
  emphasizes collective intentionality (we-intentions) rather than joint commitments, and he
  grounds institutional reality in human intentionality without requiring explicit agreements.
  Status functions persist through collective acceptance even when individual participants change.

  RELEVANCE: Searle's framework is widely used in social ontology and raises questions about
  tradition's ontological status. Are traditions institutional facts constituted by collective
  acceptance? If so, what is the "X counts as Y" structure? Perhaps: "This practice (X) counts
  as authoritative tradition (Y) in our community (C)"? Searle's emphasis on collective acceptance
  and status functions helps explain how traditions can persist across generations despite
  changing participants. His framework is essential for situating tradition within contemporary
  social ontology debates.

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Tuomela develops a comprehensive account of social practices as sustained by
  collective acceptance. He distinguishes between I-mode (individual mode) and we-mode (collective
  mode) attitudes and actions. In we-mode, individuals act as group members, committing to group
  reasons and goals. Social practices, including traditions, are sustained through collective
  acceptance of constitutive and regulative rules. Tuomela emphasizes that social practices
  require participants to act as group members rather than merely as individuals pursuing private
  goals.

  RELEVANCE: Tuomela's we-mode framework provides conceptual resources for understanding how
  traditions are collectively sustained. If traditions are social practices requiring collective
  acceptance, then participants must adopt we-mode attitudes: acting as members of the tradition-
  bearing community rather than as isolated individuals. This helps explain tradition's normative
  force and its persistence across individual lifecycles. Tuomela's framework connects tradition
  to social ontology debates about collective intentionality and raises questions about what
  kind of collective acceptance is required for tradition.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Salice examines social ontology from the phenomenological realist tradition
  (Reinach, Scheler, Stein), showing how this tradition offers distinctive resources for
  understanding social entities. Phenomenological realists emphasize the sui generis character
  of social acts and entities, irreducible to individual mental states or aggregations. Social
  acts like promising create objective obligations and social relations with their own ontological
  status. This tradition emphasizes the normative and obligatory character of social phenomena.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about tradition, Salice's reconstruction of phenomenological
  social ontology provides alternative conceptual resources to the dominant Anglo-American
  frameworks (Gilbert, Searle, Tuomela). If traditions are understood as social entities with
  normative force, the phenomenological tradition offers tools for analyzing their sui generis
  character. This is particularly relevant because hermeneutic accounts of tradition (Gadamer)
  are rooted in phenomenology, suggesting connections between phenomenological social ontology
  and hermeneutic accounts of tradition.

  POSITION: Phenomenological realism in social ontology. Social acts and entities as sui generis
  with irreducible normative and obligatory character, drawing on Reinach, Scheler, and Stein.

  doi = {10.1080/13581650120105543},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Olwig distinguishes "custom" from "tradition" in environmental heritage contexts.
  Custom is embedded practice, tacit and evolving organically through everyday life ("time out
  of mind"). Tradition is explicitly thematized inheritance, consciously transmitted and claimed
  as authoritative ("mind out of time"). This distinction challenges romantic notions that conflate
  the two, showing that what we call "tradition" often involves modern invention and conscious
  construction rather than organic continuity. Olwig applies this to heritage conservation,
  arguing that treating living customs as traditions can freeze and distort them.

  RELEVANCE: Olwig's distinction between custom and tradition is conceptually important for
  the research project. It challenges the common conflation of these terms and suggests they
  name different social phenomena: custom as unreflective practice embedded in everyday life,
  tradition as reflexive claim about authoritative inheritance. This resonates with Beckstein's
  distinction between tradition and custom based on explicit transmission and claimed continuity.
  For political philosophy, this distinction matters: customs may be sites of practical wisdom
  (Oakeshott), while traditions may be sites of authority claims and contestation (Arendt).

  number = {1},
  pages = {129--141},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grad analyzes tradition as a communication system with a rational structure.
  Drawing on pragmatics and language game theory (Wittgenstein), he argues that traditions
  function as rule-governed communication systems within closed communities. Traditions establish
  defined principles of communication for members and rules of inclusion for potential new
  members. The rational structure of tradition lies in its systematic organization of meaning
  and practice, not in the content of what is transmitted. This shifts focus from tradition's
  content to its structural properties as a communication system.

  RELEVANCE: Grad's pragmatic approach offers a distinctive angle on tradition, focusing on
  its communicative and rule-governed character. This connects tradition to debates about
  linguistic convention (Lewis) while emphasizing tradition's closure and membership boundaries
  (unlike open linguistic conventions). For the research project, this raises questions about
  tradition's relationship to Wittgensteinian forms of life and language games. It also suggests
  tensions: if traditions are closed communication systems, how do they evolve? How do outsiders
  gain access?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Balabushka traces the evolution of the concept of tradition across multiple
  disciplinary perspectives (philosophy, ethnology, religion, art history, ethnography). The
  paper analyzes different types and classifications of tradition, showing how the concept has
  been theorized differently in national versus foreign historiography. Tradition is presented
  as the result of material and spiritual socio-cultural heritage that determines national
  identity and statehood, constituted by collective human activity. The paper uses historical-
  retrospective and systematic methods to map the concept's development.

  RELEVANCE: This synthetic overview helps situate tradition within broader cultural studies
  and heritage discourses. While less philosophically rigorous than other entries, it demonstrates
  how tradition functions as a concept across multiple disciplines beyond philosophy. For a
  project surveying how tradition is defined across fields, Balabushka's multidisciplinary
  perspective shows the concept's complexity and disciplinary variation. It also highlights
  tradition's connection to identity and collective memory, themes important in political
  philosophy.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Turner traces the intellectual history of "post-traditional" discourse in
  sociology, showing how the concept of post-tradition itself became a tradition. Starting
  with Weber's disenchantment thesis and moving through critical theory and reflexive modernization
  theory (Giddens, Beck), Turner reveals the paradox: critiques of tradition create their own
  authoritative lineages. Post-traditional theorists inherit and transmit particular ways of
  diagnosing modernity's relationship to tradition. Turner exposes the concept's variations
  and motivations, questioning whether post-traditional society is possible or merely an
  ideological self-description of modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Turner's genealogy of post-traditional discourse is crucial for understanding
  contemporary debates about tradition. It shows how "tradition" functions as a contested
  category in social theory, with different theorists using it to mark the boundary between
  modern and pre-modern society. For political philosophy, this raises questions about whether
  tradition is necessarily pre-modern or whether it persists (perhaps transformed) in modernity.
  Turner's work also demonstrates reflexive irony: the "tradition of post-tradition" suggests
  we cannot fully escape tradition even in diagnosing its end.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sokolov and Kuznetsov analyze the correlation between philosophical methodology
  in modernity and the problematization of tradition in the humanities. They argue that tradition
  became a starting point for developing humanitarian knowledge and contributed to philosophical
  research's methodological expansion. Tracing from Romantic fascination with antiquity through
  19th century attempts to rationally reconstruct religious and historical texts, they show how
  tradition's problematization shaped disciplinary development (history, psychology, linguistics).
  The paper connects phenomenology, hermeneutics (Dilthey, Husserl), and structuralism through
  their shared engagement with tradition. They provocatively suggest that even anti-rationalist
  traditionalism (Guenon) reproduces modern methodological patterns.

  RELEVANCE: This paper illuminates how "tradition" became a methodological problem for modern
  philosophy and human sciences. It shows that tradition is not simply an object of study but
  a concept that shaped disciplinary self-understanding and method. For a project on how
  tradition is conceptualized, this highlights that disciplinary commitments and methodological
  orientations structure how tradition is defined. The connection between hermeneutic philosophy
  and tradition scholarship is particularly important for understanding Gadamer's influence.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzing tradition through René Guénon's traditionalism, Karimov and Bekbaev
  argue that tradition enables intercultural and interreligious dialogue. For Guénon, tradition
  has exoteric (social order) and esoteric (spiritual truth) dimensions. The esoteric essence,
  comprehended through intellectual intuition beyond rational thought, reveals coincidences
  between religious traditions across cultures. Western modernity's anti-traditionalism
  (materialism, egalitarianism, individualism) represents a civilizational crisis, resolvable
  only through reviving tradition via Eastern religious experience. The authors examine how
  tradition functions as a connecting factor between cultures through shared spiritual realities.

  RELEVANCE: While representing a particular metaphysical position (perennialist traditionalism),
  this paper illustrates one influential understanding of tradition as trans-cultural spiritual
  reality accessible through non-rational intuition. This contrasts sharply with social-scientific
  and hermeneutic approaches that view traditions as particular, culturally-embedded formations.
  For a comprehensive survey of how tradition is conceptualized, including traditionalist
  metaphysics helps map the full conceptual space, even if this position is marginal in
  contemporary political philosophy.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pieper provides a philosophical-theological analysis of tradition, arguing
  that authentic tradition ultimately refers to sacred tradition going back to divine revelation.
  He distinguishes genuine tradition from mere convention or custom by tradition's claim to
  transmit truth from a primordial source. Tradition is not simply what is handed down, but what
  is authoritatively handed down as true and binding. Pieper emphasizes tradition's claim to
  truth and its grounding in a founding event or revelation that establishes its authority.
  This connects tradition to questions of truth, authority, and the relationship between human
  culture and transcendent reality.

  RELEVANCE: Pieper represents the theological-metaphysical approach to tradition, important
  for understanding how tradition is conceptualized in religious contexts and in thinkers
  influenced by religious thought. His emphasis on tradition's claim to truth (not merely its
  facticity as transmitted) raises philosophical questions about tradition's epistemological
  status. For political philosophy, Pieper's account highlights tensions between secular and
  religious understandings of tradition. His work is cited in contemporary philosophical
  discussions (see PhilPapers results), showing ongoing influence.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Fernand Dumont's concept of "mediating institutions" and Himani
  Bannerji's critique of multiculturalism, Melançon examines how philosophy can mediate between
  diverse traditions in contexts of cultural plurality. Dumont saw philosophy as referring to
  a tradition of radical self-questioning, a second-order tradition that reflects on first-order
  traditions. However, Dumont's framework addressed Quebec's social changes without adequately
  accounting for multiple coexisting traditions. Melançon brings Dumont into dialogue with
  Bannerji's critique of hegemonic tradition-protection, seeking non-hegemonic mediation between
  sets of traditions. The paper addresses how traditions can coexist and interact without
  domination.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses a crucial problem for contemporary political philosophy: how
  to think about tradition in pluralistic, multicultural societies. It goes beyond single-
  tradition frameworks (MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality) to ask about relationships
  between traditions. The concept of mediating institutions and philosophy's role as second-order
  tradition is philosophically rich. For the research project, this illustrates how tradition
  is being reconceptualized to address contemporary political challenges of diversity, moving
  beyond older conservative or hermeneutic models.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord examines Gadamer's hermeneutic account of tradition and its political
  implications. He shows how Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition responds to Enlightenment
  critiques while avoiding conservative traditionalism. For Gadamer, tradition is not a body
  of static content but the historical dimension of understanding itself—we understand by
  applying past meanings to present situations. This makes tradition enabling rather than
  constraining. Ambord explores how this hermeneutic conception influences political thought,
  particularly debates about tradition's role in legitimating or challenging political orders.

  RELEVANCE: This paper helps clarify Gadamer's influence on contemporary political philosophy's
  treatment of tradition. It shows how hermeneutic philosophy transformed tradition from an
  object of conservative reverence or Enlightenment critique into a condition of understanding.
  For the research project, this is essential for mapping the hermeneutic position alongside
  conservative and critical approaches. Ambord's focus on political implications also directly
  addresses how philosophical concepts of tradition connect to political theory.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book demonstrates that the transformation of Edmund Burke into the "founder of modern conservatism" occurred primarily between 1830 and 1914 in Britain, not in Burke's own lifetime. The construction of "Burkean conservatism"—emphasizing tradition, organic society, order, religion, and property—was a conscious political project by later conservatives, particularly during debates over Irish Home Rule and the Edwardian constitutional crisis. Burke himself was a Whig reformer, not a conservative ideologue.

  RELEVANCE: This work is foundational for understanding that "the conservative tradition" rooted in Burke is itself a historical construction, not a natural inheritance. It reveals how invocations of tradition serve political purposes and shows that what counts as "traditional" is contested and variable. For a study of tradition as a concept, this demonstrates that traditions about tradition are themselves constructed through selective appropriation and interpretation of past thinkers.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bourke argues that there is no transhistorical political philosophy of conservatism and that the notion of a conservative tradition is a belated construction. Examining Burke in his original Whig context, Bourke shows he was committed to reform, not preservation. The article critiques twentieth-century accounts (Mannheim, Epstein, Huntington) that identified conservatism as opposition to the French Revolution and traces how this intellectual tradition was invented rather than inherited.

  RELEVANCE: This article directly challenges the idea that conservative political philosophy constitutes a genuine "tradition" and argues that the concept of conservatism itself is unstable and historically contingent. It provides critical perspective on how political traditions are constructed retrospectively and warns against reifying "the conservative tradition" as a unified intellectual lineage.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz provides a comprehensive analysis of MacIntyre's conception of tradition as central to his ethical and political philosophy. The book examines MacIntyre's response to relativism through the idea of "tradition-constituted rationality"—the view that all rational inquiry occurs within traditions, yet traditions can rationally evaluate themselves and engage competing traditions. Lutz explores how MacIntyre's Thomistic commitments shape his understanding of tradition and how this avoids both relativism and absolutism.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre offers one of the most sophisticated contemporary defenses of tradition's epistemic authority while avoiding conservative dogmatism. His work is crucial for the project because it shows how tradition can be defended philosophically without rejecting rational criticism or comparative evaluation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Flett examines MacIntyre's conception of tradition-constituted inquiry through comparison with Michael Polanyi's epistemology. Both thinkers reject the Enlightenment ideal of tradition-independent rationality and argue that all knowing involves tacit frameworks and commitments. Flett shows how MacIntyre's account of traditions as frameworks for rational inquiry parallels Polanyi's account of knowledge as rooted in fiduciary commitments and intellectual passions that cannot be fully articulated.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis illuminates the epistemological foundations of MacIntyre's defense of tradition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive SEP article surveys the diverse meanings of conservatism and questions whether there exists a coherent conservative political philosophy. It distinguishes between conservatism as temperament (skepticism about change), as ideology (opposing the French Revolution and defending hierarchy, tradition, religion), and as party politics. The article examines key conservative thinkers (Burke, Oakeshott, Scruton) while noting fundamental disagreements among them about what counts as conservative and what should be conserved.

  RELEVANCE: Provides authoritative overview of debates about conservatism's relationship to tradition and shows the contested nature of conservative political philosophy itself. The article's careful distinctions between different forms of conservatism are essential for avoiding oversimplified accounts of "the conservative tradition." It demonstrates that conservatism's relationship to tradition is itself deeply contested within conservative thought.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This SEP entry provides systematic exposition of Oakeshott's philosophy, particularly his conception of tradition as a "flow of sympathy" and mode of understanding grounded in practical knowledge rather than technical rationality. Oakeshott argues that political activity should be understood as pursuing intimations within a tradition of behavior rather than applying abstract principles or pursuing ideological ends. His conservatism emphasizes skepticism about rationalist politics and deference to inherited practices.

  RELEVANCE: Oakeshott provides a distinctively philosophical (rather than ideological) defense of tradition in politics. His conception of tradition as practical knowledge transmitted through participation rather than abstract rules offers an influential account of tradition's epistemology. Essential for understanding mid-20th century conservative political philosophy and its critique of rationalism in politics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This SEP entry provides comprehensive analysis of Burke's political thought, carefully situating him as an 18th-century Whig committed to constitutional reform and liberty rather than as a proto-conservative defender of tradition per se. While Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France emphasized prescription, prejudice, and inherited wisdom against French revolutionary rationalism, his broader career shows commitment to reforming abuses and defending constitutional rights. The entry challenges simplistic readings of Burke as founder of conservatism.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for accurate understanding of Burke's actual views on tradition, prescription, and political change, as opposed to later conservative appropriations. Shows that Burke's defense of "prejudice" and inherited wisdom was situated within Whig constitutional thought, not conservative ideology. Critical for distinguishing Burke's historical position from "Burkean conservatism" as later constructed.

  pages = {5--18},
  doi = {10.4000/151ii},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hörcher examines Scruton's engagement with classical political philosophy, arguing that Scruton drew on both Platonic and Aristotelian elements rather than adhering to one ancient tradition. Scruton's conservative philosophy emphasized the human need for community, order, and transcendent meaning, which he found expressed in classical thought. His interest in ancient philosophy was not merely academic but informed his identity as a conservative public intellectual committed to defending Western cultural tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates how contemporary conservative political philosophy constructs continuity with ancient traditions, using classical sources to legitimate conservative commitments. Scruton's work exemplifies how appeals to "the great tradition" function normatively to ground contemporary politics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This book provides comprehensive analysis of Scruton's conservative political philosophy, focusing on the central role of aesthetics and culture. Hörcher argues that Scruton's conservatism is fundamentally about defending inherited cultural forms—artistic traditions, architectural styles, musical canons—against modernist destruction. Scruton sees tradition as embodied in cultural practices that transmit meaning across generations, and he defends tradition's authority through aesthetic rather than purely political arguments.

  RELEVANCE: Scruton represents contemporary conservative defense of tradition that emphasizes cultural transmission and aesthetic inheritance. His work shows how conservative political philosophy extends beyond narrow political institutions to encompass broad cultural traditions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Murphy argues that Scruton represents the most important conservative thinker of his generation, embodying the conservative insight that human identity requires continuity and durability amidst change. Against dominant philosophical views that human nature is plastic and identity is constructed, Scruton defends the idea that beneath surface changes lie deep continuities. Tradition provides the durability and persistence that humans need to answer questions of identity and meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Captures the contemporary conservative case for tradition as necessary for human identity and meaning-making. Shows how conservative defenses of tradition rest on anthropological and metaphysical claims about human nature, not merely political expediency.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Castellano argues that Romantic-era conservatism, exemplified by Burke, developed an environmental ethic rooted in defending tradition and inherited landscapes against capitalist modernization. Burke's emphasis on intergenerational responsibility and organic community anticipated environmental conservation. This "conservative natural law tradition" (Burke, Hegel) contrasts with liberal individualism and offers resources for ecological thought.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals unexpected connections between conservative defense of tradition and environmental conservation, both opposing rationalist "improvement" and commodification. Shows how conservative traditionalism can ground critiques of capitalism and modernization, not merely defend them.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bridge examines Burke's response to the French Revolution and his influence on subsequent conservative thought. While acknowledging Burke's foundational importance, Bridge notes that Burke's conservatism emerged from specific historical circumstances (defending the Glorious Revolution settlement against French radicalism) rather than systematic conservative philosophy. The "conservative tradition" traced to Burke is partly retrospective construction.

  RELEVANCE: Provides accessible overview of Burke's relationship to conservative political tradition while acknowledging its constructed nature.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Morello argues for religious establishment within conservative political philosophy, critiquing Scruton's secular conservatism as internally incoherent. Drawing on Burke and de Maistre alongside contemporary personalism, Morello contends that conservative emphasis on "transcendent bonds" and tradition requires theological foundations. Secular conservatism cannot sustain the communal and transcendent commitments it values without religious grounding.

  RELEVANCE: Represents debate within contemporary conservatism about tradition's foundations—whether tradition can be defended on purely philosophical grounds or requires theological commitment. Shows ongoing contestation about what grounds conservative appeals to tradition and whether tradition is ultimately secular or religious. Illustrates diversity within conservative political philosophy about tradition's basis.

  pages = {3--28},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276414558885},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Foucault's genealogy traces critique from ancient parrhesia (truth-telling) through Enlightenment to liberal critique of the state, revealing critique as an ethos of "permanent critique" rather than a fixed method. Foucault shows how critique emerged from religious practices of conscience examination and became secularized in Enlightenment demands to "dare to know." The paper demonstrates how Foucault's turn to genealogy of critique changed his theoretical assumptions about power and subjectivity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how critical perspectives on tradition themselves have a history and are situated practices. Foucault's genealogy reveals that critique is not a timeless standpoint outside tradition but emerges from specific historical practices. This complicates simplistic oppositions between tradition and critique, showing how Enlightenment critique of tradition is itself a tradition with its own genealogy and power effects.

  number = {4},
  pages = {467--482},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.12724},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Forst argues that Frankfurt School critical theory fundamentally aims to uncover forms of social domination ideologically presented as rationality—what Adorno called "the unreason of the dominant reason." Critical theory develops a historically situated, normatively reflexive critique that explains why existing power relations prevent emergence of more rational social orders while conceiving what such orders would look like. This requires both unmasking ideology and articulating emancipatory possibilities.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary articulation of how Frankfurt School tradition critiques tradition and authority as forms of "social unreason." Crucial for understanding how critical theory analyzes tradition not as neutral inheritance but as potentially ideological formation serving domination. Forst's emphasis on "rational critique" shows how this tradition inherits Enlightenment commitment to reason while subjecting that inheritance itself to critical examination.

  doi = {10.1163/EJ.9789004208858.I-439.13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson locates Honneth's recognition theory within Frankfurt School tradition while noting his departure from first-generation pessimism about modernity. Unlike Adorno and Horkheimer who saw Enlightenment dialectically producing domination, Honneth retrieves normative resources from modern institutions through "normative reconstruction." His theory of recognition patterns offers alternative to both classical critical theory's totalized critique and Habermas's procedural rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding how third-generation critical theory relates to tradition differently than earlier Frankfurt School. Honneth's method of "normative reconstruction" seeks emancipatory potential within existing traditions and institutions rather than wholesale rejection. This shifts the critical relationship to tradition from external denunciation to immanent development of progressive possibilities already present.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mahmood's critique of "teleological feminism" challenges liberal feminist assumption that agency only manifests as resistance to patriarchal norms. Through ethnography of Egyptian piety movement, Mahmood shows how women gain agency through cultivating virtuous dispositions within traditional Islamic practices. The paper argues Mahmood escapes the "Hegelian trap" of replicating oppression in feminist futures by emphasizing creative, immanent transformation rather than oppositional overcoming of tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial feminist intervention questioning whether critique of tradition must take form of liberal rejection. Mahmood reveals how liberal feminist frameworks impose teleological narrative of progress from traditional oppression to modern freedom, obscuring women's actual modes of agency and self-transformation. Her work complicates domain's assumption that critical perspective on tradition equals rejection, showing how engagement with traditional practices can be site of ethical cultivation and political agency.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen develops feminist critical theory by synthesizing Frankfurt School tradition with Foucauldian analytics of power and poststructuralist critiques. She argues that theories of autonomy must account for how subjects are constituted through power relations, including traditional norms and practices. Against liberal voluntarism, Allen shows autonomy emerges through critical engagement with the very traditions and power structures that shape us, not through escape from them.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges Frankfurt School and feminist theory to show how critical perspective on tradition must account for subject-formation through traditional practices. Allen's work reveals limitations of liberal autonomy theory which assumes subjects stand outside traditions they critique.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Allen argues Frankfurt School critical theory remains complicit in Eurocentric progress narratives despite its critique of Enlightenment. She demonstrates how Habermas, Honneth, and others rely on developmental logics that privilege Western modernity as telos of human emancipation. Drawing on postcolonial theory, Allen proposes decolonizing critical theory by abandoning progress narratives while retaining commitment to emancipatory critique through "contextualist" approach attentive to multiple modernities.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals how critical theory's own inheritance of Enlightenment tradition limits its emancipatory potential by universalizing Western historical trajectory. Essential for understanding how critique of tradition can itself be traditional in problematic ways. Allen shows that genuinely critical perspective requires reflexive examination of critical theory's own situatedness within Western intellectual tradition and its colonial legacies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dostal examines Gadamer's complex relationship to Enlightenment, showing how his critique of Enlightenment prejudice against prejudice does not simply reject Enlightenment but retrieves its authentic critical spirit. Gadamer argues Enlightenment's blanket rejection of tradition as prejudice itself becomes a prejudice, obscuring how understanding always operates within traditions. Yet Gadamer affirms Enlightenment's critical impulse when directed at genuine dogmatism rather than tradition per se.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding hermeneutic critique of Enlightenment rationalism's opposition between tradition and reason. Gadamer's rehabilitation of prejudice and authority (rightly understood) challenges liberal assumption that critical thinking requires freedom from traditional inheritances. His work reveals how Enlightenment critique of tradition paradoxically relies on its own unexamined traditional assumptions about reason and progress.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Tayob demonstrates how modern Muslim intellectuals use "religion" as critical category to critique both tradition and modernity, developing strategies for renewal distinct from Kantian Enlightenment project. Through analysis of thinkers from Muhammad 'Abduh to Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, Tayob shows Islamic modernism develops alternative critical relationship to tradition that doesn't conform to Western secular frameworks. These intellectual traditions point toward different modes of relating to self, other, and political modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for decentering European frameworks in understanding critical perspectives on tradition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Fatima Mernissi's and Mohammed Arkoun's strategies for rereading classical Islamic texts to develop contemporary normative grammar of justice. Mernissi recovers marginalized intellectuals and schools from Islamic history to derive immanent principles of justice, critiquing patriarchal interpretations from feminist perspective. Arkoun develops transcultural humanism based on both Islamic ethics and Greek philosophy through deconstructive examination. Both approaches aim to overcome narrow identitarian understandings prevalent in Muslim and Western societies.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how progressive rereading of classical tradition can serve critical purposes without wholesale rejection.

His Hegelian approach reveals how liberal tradition misconceives freedom as individual capacity rather than social achievement.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how Frankfurt School critically reconstructs liberal tradition by revealing its inadequate conception of autonomy and freedom. Honneth's critique demonstrates that liberal emphasis on individual autonomy paradoxically undermines genuine freedom by abstracting from social conditions that enable self-realization.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lötter provides feminist critique of Habermas's rationalistic vision of emancipated society, arguing it neglects care ethics and emotional dimensions of human relationships. Drawing on Carol Gilligan's ethic of care, George Lakoff's work on metaphor and morality, and neuroscientific research on attachment, Lötter argues Habermas's communicative rationality must be complemented by feminist attention to care, vulnerability, and emotional nurturing. Post-structuralist methodology allows integrating Habermas's universalism with feminist emphasis on specificity.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how feminist theory critiques Frankfurt School tradition for reproducing masculine biases despite critical intent. Shows that Habermas's emphasis on rational argumentation reflects gendered assumptions about public sphere that marginalize traditionally feminine domains of care and emotion.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for understanding classical liberal position on tradition which is more nuanced than simple opposition. Mill's approach shows how liberal emphasis on autonomy can accommodate tradition when understood as enabling rather than constraining self-development. Important for domain because it reveals internal tension within liberal tradition between critique of traditional authority and recognition that autonomy develops within cultural contexts shaped by tradition.

  POSITION: Classical liberal position balancing individual autonomy with recognition of tradition's role in character formation and social life.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Smirnov distinguishes negative liberty (liberal tradition) from autonomy (republican tradition), tracing their origins to 17th-century mechanicism and Spinoza-Kant respectively. Republican critique reveals liberalism's limited understanding of interference in free choice, unable to comprehend subtle forms of domination. However, republican freedom also has limitations revealed by appeal to autonomy concept—it cannot address restrictions from internalized values. Smirnov proposes autonomy as critical framework exposing both liberal and republican blind spots.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how different critical perspectives on tradition (liberal, republican, autonomy-based) have distinct limitations and affordances. Important for understanding that critique of traditional authority comes in multiple forms with different philosophical foundations. Demonstrates need for conceptual precision when discussing "liberal critique of tradition" since liberalism itself is contested tradition with internal variations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Groarke critiques Anthony Giddens's late modern social theory for inadequate theorization of relationship between autonomy and tradition. Argues Giddens's "utopian realism" overstates extent to which reflexive modernity enables autonomous self-creation free from traditional constraints. By examining Giddens's sociological and philosophical foundations, Groarke shows how his account underestimates tradition's continued constitutive role in identity formation even under conditions of high modernity.

  RELEVANCE: Critiques influential sociological theory's assumption that late modernity dissolves tradition's authority, leaving autonomous individuals. Important for showing how social theory often reproduces simplified opposition between tradition and autonomy characteristic of liberal thought. Demonstrates need for more nuanced account of how tradition and critical reflection interact in contemporary conditions rather than assuming modernity's "detraditionalization."

  CORE ARGUMENT: Santoro develops systematic critique of liberal conception of autonomous subject, examining historical formation and philosophical foundations of liberal subjectivity.

Through critical analysis of liberal political philosophy from Locke through contemporary theory, shows how liberal subjectivity occludes power relations and social constitution of identity.

  RELEVANCE: Comprehensive philosophical critique of liberal tradition's foundational concepts relevant to understanding how liberalism theorizes relationship between individual and tradition.

  isbn = {978-0847683154},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gilbert develops "plural subject theory" arguing that
  collective phenomena require joint commitment rather than individual
  intentions. When individuals form a plural subject, they create
  obligations and entitlements that cannot be unilaterally revoked.
  Social practices including traditions are constituted by such joint
  commitments, which bind participants together normatively. Emphasizes
  that collective intentionality involves obligations of joint
  commitment, not mere aggregation of individual attitudes.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject account directly addresses how
  traditions bind participants across time. Joint commitment explains
  tradition's normative force—why members feel obligated to maintain
  practices. Her emphasis on non-reductionism supports viewing tradition
  as having emergent social ontological properties. The concept of joint
  commitment illuminates how traditions persist despite membership

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schatzki develops practice-based social ontology arguing
  that social life is organized by practices—embodied, materially
  mediated arrays of human activity. Practices are constituted by
  practical understandings, rules, and teleoaffective structures
  (ends-projects-emotions). Social phenomena are not primarily mental

  and are sites where individual and social intersect.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to intentionality-based accounts by
  grounding tradition in organized practices rather than collective
  beliefs. Schatzki's framework illuminates how traditions are embodied
  and materially mediated, not just mentally represented. His emphasis on
  practical understanding explains how traditions are transmitted through

  CORE ARGUMENT: List and Pettit develop functionalist account of group
  agency. Groups can be agents when they meet functional criteria:
  representational states, motivational states, and capacity to process

  individual states. Groups can have attitudes and intentions distinct
  from members' attitudes through aggregation procedures. Argues groups
  are genuine agents capable of belief, desire, and intentional action.

  RELEVANCE: Provides framework for understanding how traditions enable
  collective agency. Groups structured by traditions can have collective
  intentions and responsibilities irreducible to members. Their
  supervenience thesis explains how traditions persist through membership
  changes—collective properties depend on but transcend individual
  properties. However, focus on synchronic groups leaves questions about
  diachronic collective agency across generations that traditions involve.

  editor = {Roth, Guenther and Wittich, Claus},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Weber presents his comprehensive sociology of domination (Herrschaft), distinguishing three pure types of legitimate authority: rational-legal, traditional, and charismatic. Traditional authority rests on belief in the sanctity of age-old rules and powers, with obedience owed to the person who occupies the traditionally sanctioned position of authority. Weber analyzes various forms of traditional authority, from gerontocracy and patriarchalism to patrimonialism and feudalism, showing how each type structures social action and legitimates power through appeals to custom and precedent.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides the foundational sociological framework for understanding tradition as a basis of legitimate authority and social action. Weber's typology remains essential for political philosophy debates about the normative grounds of authority and the tension between tradition and rationalization. His account of traditional action as distinct from value-rational and instrumentally rational action offers crucial conceptual resources for analyzing how tradition operates as both constraint and justification in political life. The work connects directly to debates about whether tradition can provide legitimate grounds for authority in modern societies.

  POSITION: Represents the classical sociological position that tradition constitutes a distinct form of social legitimation based on sacred continuity rather than rational-legal procedures or charismatic breakthrough, while arguing that traditional authority faces increasing pressure from rationalization processes.

  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shils develops the most comprehensive sociological theory of tradition, arguing that tradition involves anything transmitted or handed down from the past to the present and encompasses not just beliefs but practices, institutions, and material objects. He contends that tradition is essential to social order because it connects individuals to the sacred center of society and provides continuity across generations. Tradition is not static but involves selective transmission, modification, and periodic renewal. Shils distinguishes various types of traditions (substantive, personal, primordial) and analyzes institutional bearers of tradition including universities, religious communities, and legal systems.

  RELEVANCE: Shils's work offers the most sustained sociological defense of tradition's continuing importance in modern society, directly challenging narratives of inevitable secularization and detraditionalization. For political philosophy, his account of tradition as inherently connected to the sacred dimension of collective life provides resources for understanding why traditions carry normative weight beyond their instrumental utility. His analysis of how traditions change while maintaining continuity addresses the philosophical problem of whether tradition can accommodate rational criticism and adaptation. The work is essential for debates about whether modern liberal societies can or should maintain traditions.

  POSITION: Represents a conservative-functionalist position arguing that tradition is not merely residual from premodern society but constitutes an essential, continuing basis of social integration and meaning, even (or especially) in modern contexts where it faces challenges from rationalization and individualization.

  doi = {10.1017/CBO9781107295636},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hobsbawm and Ranger demonstrate that many traditions appearing to be ancient are actually of recent origin and often deliberately invented for political purposes. "Invented tradition" refers to practices claiming or appearing to have continuity with the past but actually established through formal or informal repetition and ritual. The authors show how traditions were invented to establish social cohesion, legitimate institutions and authority, and socialize individuals into particular values and behaviors. Case studies include the British monarchy's invented ceremonial, Scottish Highland traditions, and African colonial governance. The work challenges essentialist views that treat traditions as natural or timeless.

  RELEVANCE: This work profoundly influenced debates about tradition by exposing the constructedness of what appear to be primordial customs. For political philosophy, it raises critical questions about whether constructed traditions can legitimately ground political authority or identity. The "invention" thesis challenges conservative arguments appealing to ancient wisdom or organic development, suggesting instead that traditions serve contemporary political interests. However, the work also opens questions about whether all traditions are equally invented and whether invention necessarily delegitimates tradition. Essential for understanding the relationship between tradition, power, and political legitimacy.

  POSITION: Represents a critical-constructivist position that demystifies tradition by revealing its political functions and recent origins, challenging both romantic conservatism and naive appeals to ancient wisdom while raising questions about tradition's epistemic and normative status.

  doi = {10.1017/CBO9781107295636.001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In this introductory essay, Hobsbawm defines "invented tradition" as a set of practices governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules of a ritual or symbolic nature, seeking to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past. He distinguishes invented tradition from genuine historical tradition and from convention or routine. Hobsbawm argues that invented traditions emerge especially during periods of rapid social transformation when old traditions no longer function and new ones must be created to establish social cohesion, legitimate new institutions, and socialize individuals into changed belief systems.

  RELEVANCE: This essay provides the theoretical framework for the invention of tradition thesis, specifying the conditions under which traditions are deliberately constructed and the social functions they serve. For philosophical analysis of tradition, Hobsbawm's distinction between invented and genuine tradition raises questions about what makes some traditions authentic and others spurious, whether this distinction itself is sustainable, and what normative implications follow from tradition's constructed character. The account connects to debates in political philosophy about the relationship between history, memory, and political legitimacy.

  POSITION: Elaborates the constructivist critique of tradition by showing how apparently ancient practices emerge from modern political needs, while acknowledging that not all traditions are equally invented and that genuine historical continuity exists alongside deliberate innovation.

  year = {1991},
  publisher = {Polity Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Giddens analyzes how late modernity transforms the relationship between self and society through reflexivity, disembedding mechanisms, and the transformation of intimacy. He argues that in late modernity, tradition loses its hold because practices are no longer justified by their pastness but must be reflexively examined and chosen. The self becomes a reflexive project requiring continuous revision in light of new information and possibilities. Trust in abstract systems and expert knowledge replaces trust in tradition and local community. However, tradition doesn't simply disappear but operates differently, becoming something individuals consciously choose to maintain rather than unreflexively follow.

  RELEVANCE: This work fundamentally reframes debates about tradition by showing how reflexivity transforms rather than eliminates tradition's role in modern life. For political philosophy, Giddens's account suggests that tradition can no longer serve as an unreflective basis for authority but must justify itself in terms comprehensible to reflexive agents. His analysis of post-traditional society raises questions about whether chosen traditions can perform the same social functions as inherited ones and whether reflexivity ultimately corrodes or transforms tradition's normative force. Essential for understanding tradition in pluralistic, democratic societies where justification cannot simply appeal to pastness.

  POSITION: Represents a reflexive modernization approach arguing that late modernity involves detraditionalization through increased reflexivity, but tradition persists in transformed ways as individuals and communities consciously choose to maintain certain practices while subjecting them to ongoing critical examination.

  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.2307/3341775},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The three authors present complementary accounts of reflexive modernization as modernity's confrontation with its own consequences and limitations. Giddens's contribution focuses specifically on tradition in post-traditional society, arguing that tradition becomes open to discursive justification rather than resting on formulaic truth. In dialogic democracy, tradition must engage with other traditions and submit to interrogation. Beck analyzes risk society where traditional certainties dissolve. Lash examines aesthetic reflexivity. Together they argue that reflexive modernization transforms but doesn't eliminate tradition, creating new forms of traditionalism and new relationships between tradition and innovation.

  RELEVANCE: This collaborative work provides the most influential account of how tradition operates under conditions of late modernity and globalization. Giddens's chapters on post-traditional society directly address how tradition can function when it loses its taken-for-granted character and must justify itself dialogically. For political philosophy, this raises questions about whether dialogically defended tradition retains tradition's distinctive character or becomes something else entirely. The work connects to debates about deliberative democracy, multiculturalism, and the possibility of rationally justified tradition that addresses MacIntyre's critique of liberal rationality.

  POSITION: Represents the reflexive modernization school arguing that late modernity involves the radicalization of modernity's own principles, transforming tradition from unreflective inheritance into consciously chosen and dialogically defended practices that must justify themselves in public discourse.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs provides a comprehensive analysis of Edward Shils's multifaceted theory of tradition, identifying four distinct perspectives within Shils's work: pragmatic (tradition as useful knowledge accumulated over time), Burkean (tradition embodying collective wisdom), veridical (tradition as transmitting truth about reality), and evolutionist (tradition as selected through social evolution). Jacobs shows how Shils synthesizes these perspectives while emphasizing tradition's connection to the sacred and its role in social integration. The article also examines Shils's typology of traditions and his account of institutional bearers.

  RELEVANCE: This article is essential for understanding the most systematic sociological theory of tradition and its internal complexities. Jacobs's identification of multiple strands within Shils's thought helps explain both the richness and tensions in Shils's account. For political philosophy, the article illuminates how sociological defenses of tradition can draw on various normative and epistemological commitments, from pragmatist to conservative to realist grounds. Understanding Shils's framework is crucial for evaluating whether tradition can provide rational justification for practices beyond appeals to mere pastness or authority.

  POSITION: Explicates and systematizes Shils's position that tradition is essential to social order, connecting individuals to sacred centers and transmitting valuable knowledge, while showing the multiple theoretical foundations underlying this conservative-functionalist stance.

  doi = {10.1353/max.2018.0000},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rust challenges standard interpretations of Weber's concept of traditional action, arguing it is neither merely habitual nor value-rational but involves subjectively meaningful behavior rendered intelligible through shared exemplars and precedents found in "documents of tradition." Traditional action has its own form of rationality based on appeal to authoritative examples rather than calculation or adherence to abstract principles. Rust extends this analysis to Weber's account of traditional authority, showing how the master's legitimacy derives from exemplars and precedents rather than just rules. This interpretation reveals important limits to standard models of social ontology that privilege rule-following.

  RELEVANCE: This article significantly refines our understanding of Weber's account of tradition, showing that traditional action involves a distinctive form of practical reasoning rather than unreflective habit. For political philosophy, Rust's analysis suggests that tradition provides a form of justification through exemplars that cannot be reduced to either instrumental rationality or deontological principle-following. This has implications for debates about practical reason, the sources of normativity, and whether tradition can ground rational action. The article also challenges social ontologies based solely on constitutive rules, suggesting traditional statuses involve exemplar-based practices.

  POSITION: Develops a sophisticated interpretation of Weberian traditional authority showing how tradition operates through exemplars and precedents, offering a form of practical rationality distinct from both instrumental calculation and value-rationality, thereby defending tradition's epistemic credentials.

  doi = {10.1177/0048393120986244},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rust argues that Weber's typology of legitimate authority reveals limitations in Searle's "Standard Model" of social ontology. While Searle's account of status functions and constitutive rules accurately describes legal-rational authority, it fails to capture traditional and charismatic forms. Traditional authority doesn't rest primarily on rules but on exemplars, precedents, and the "documents of tradition." Searle's universalist claim that he has provided "the structure of human civilization" actually describes only one way of being a civilization—the modern, rational-legal form—while obscuring how traditional societies and informal social statuses actually function.

  RELEVANCE: This article is crucial for connecting sociological theories of tradition to contemporary debates in social ontology and philosophy of social science. Rust shows that if Weber's typology is correct, then influential philosophical accounts of social reality are incomplete or parochial, designed to explain modern legal-rational societies but inadequate for understanding tradition-based social orders. For political philosophy, this suggests that theories of authority, legitimacy, and political obligation may need to recognize fundamentally different forms of social constitution beyond rule-following and status functions. The article challenges the universalist pretensions of much analytic social philosophy.

  POSITION: Uses Weber's authority typology to critique contemporary social ontology, arguing that traditional authority operates through exemplars and precedents rather than constitutive rules, revealing limits of rule-based accounts of social reality.

  doi = {10.1007/S11186-015-9263-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Szelenyi applies Weber's theory of domination to analyze post-communist societies, arguing that Weber actually identified four rather than three types: the standard legal-rational, traditional, and charismatic types, plus a fourth called "Wille der Beherrschten" (will of the dominated). The article also distinguishes between patrimonial and prebendal forms of traditional authority. Analyzing legitimation in communist and post-communist regimes, Szelenyi shows how various forms of authority combine and compete, with some post-communist systems developing illiberal, prebendal quasi-democratic structures that blend legal forms with traditional and personal loyalties.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates the continuing relevance of Weberian authority theory for understanding contemporary political systems, including how traditional forms persist or reemerge in ostensibly modern contexts. For political philosophy, Szelenyi's analysis shows that the relationship between tradition and modern legal-rational authority is more complex than simple succession or replacement narratives suggest. Traditional and patrimonial elements can be reasserted within formally legal-rational structures, raising questions about whether modern institutions truly transcend tradition or merely reconfigure it. The article is valuable for understanding tradition's role in contemporary authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.

  POSITION: Extends Weber's framework to show how traditional forms of authority (particularly patrimonialism and prebendalism) persist and combine with legal-rational structures in post-communist contexts, demonstrating tradition's ongoing political salience beyond simple modernization narratives.

  doi = {10.1111/0735-2751.00072},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Turner assesses Edward Shils's contributions to sociology, arguing that while Shils developed important insights about tradition, charisma, intellectuals, and the sacred, his work resisted systematization and often stood against prevailing sociological trends. Shils emphasized consensual elements in society when conflict theory dominated, defended tradition when modernization theory predicted its demise, and analyzed the sacred in increasingly secular academic contexts. Turner shows how Shils's insistence on tradition's continuing importance, even in modern societies, challenged both functionalist and critical paradigms in sociology.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides essential context for understanding Shils's theory of tradition within broader developments in sociological theory. Turner's analysis helps explain why Shils's defense of tradition, despite its sophistication, remained marginal to mainstream sociology dominated by modernization and secularization narratives. For political philosophy, the article illuminates the tensions between sociological accounts emphasizing tradition's decline and those, like Shils's, arguing for its persistence and necessity. Understanding these sociological debates is crucial for assessing whether philosophical defenses of tradition face empirical challenges from social science.

  POSITION: Evaluates Shils as a major but underappreciated sociological theorist whose defense of tradition's continuing significance challenged dominant narratives of modernization, secularization, and rationalization, while acknowledging limitations in his systematic theorization.

  pages = {273--290},
  doi = {10.2307/540610},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Handler and Linnekin argue against the essentialist view that divides traditions into genuine (authentic, ancient, continuously transmitted) and spurious (invented, recent, contrived) categories. Drawing on symbolic anthropology, they contend that all tradition is symbolically constructed in the present through selective interpretation of the past. What appears as continuity always involves creative reinterpretation. Authenticity is itself a symbolic concept used within traditions rather than an objective criterion for evaluating them. The authors show how even "authentic" traditions undergo continuous reconstruction as they are transmitted and adapted.

  RELEVANCE: This article represents an important anthropological contribution to debates about tradition's authenticity and construction. For political philosophy, it challenges binary oppositions between genuine and invented tradition, suggesting instead that all traditions involve ongoing symbolic construction and reinterpretation. This raises difficult questions for political theories that depend on distinguishing legitimate traditional authority from spurious appeals to fabricated histories. However, the article's radical constructivism may overcorrect by making it impossible to distinguish between traditions with genuine historical depth and recently created practices, potentially undermining normative assessments of tradition.

  POSITION: Advances a symbolic-constructivist position arguing that the genuine/spurious distinction cannot be maintained because all traditions involve continuous symbolic reconstruction in the present, challenging both essentialist and simple invention theses.

  number = {3},
  pages = {5--28},
  doi = {10.5840/TRADDISC2012/201339338},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Moodey traces how Edward Shils and Michael Polanyi moved beyond Parsons and Shils's earlier "Action Frame of Reference" to develop more nuanced accounts of tradition's role in human action. Both came to see that methodological individualism and the pattern variables framework inadequately captured how tradition structures and enables meaningful action. They developed accounts showing tradition as not merely constraining but as providing the tacit framework making purposive action possible, connecting individuals to communities and to sources of meaning that cannot be reduced to individual choice or instrumental rationality.

  RELEVANCE: This article illuminates important developments in mid-century social theory regarding how tradition relates to agency and rationality. For political philosophy, Moodey's account shows how sophisticated theorists moved beyond seeing tradition merely as irrational constraint to understanding it as enabling condition for rational action. This connects to debates about whether tradition and rational autonomy are opposed or complementary, and whether liberal theory requires or excludes traditional frameworks. The article is particularly valuable for understanding how defenses of tradition can be compatible with acknowledging human agency and purposive action.

  POSITION: Explicates Shils's and Polanyi's evolution toward viewing tradition as an enabling framework for rational action rather than its obstacle, challenging both methodological individualism and simple opposition between tradition and rationality.

  pages = {38--42},
  doi = {10.5840/TRADDISC2012/201339340},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosby responds to Moodey's article by emphasizing that while Shils and Polanyi advanced understanding of tradition's role in action, they built on Weber's recognition that tradition persists even in modern rationalized societies. Weber already recognized tradition's ongoing significance in law and religion despite rationalization pressures. Grosby argues that the crucial insight from Shils and Polanyi is that traditions necessarily persist because they provide frameworks for meaning and action that cannot be entirely replaced by instrumental rationality, even in modern conditions of globalization.

  RELEVANCE: This brief commentary helps situate Shils's and Polanyi's contributions in relation to Weber's foundational work and contemporary issues. For political philosophy, Grosby's emphasis on tradition's necessity even under modern conditions challenges simplistic progress narratives and supports the view that political orders cannot function solely on instrumental or procedural rationality. The piece connects sociological insights about tradition to broader questions in political theory about the sources of meaning, solidarity, and legitimate authority in pluralistic modern societies.

  POSITION: Emphasizes continuity from Weber through Shils and Polanyi in recognizing tradition's necessary and ongoing role even in modern rationalized societies, countering narratives of inevitable secularization and detraditionalization.

  number = {1},
  pages = {3--29},
  doi = {10.1017/S0010417500018247},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Deringil applies Hobsbawm and Ranger's "invention of tradition" framework to the late Ottoman Empire, showing how Ottoman rulers deliberately created new ceremonies, symbols, and historical narratives while claiming ancient precedent. These invented traditions aimed to bolster legitimacy, create loyalty, and project modern statehood while maintaining Islamic credentials. The article demonstrates how tradition invention served modernization projects, with rulers using supposedly ancient practices to justify contemporary reforms and centralization. This revealed the paradox of using tradition to legitimate anti-traditional changes.

  RELEVANCE: This historical case study demonstrates the practical application and utility of the invention of tradition thesis for understanding how political actors strategically deploy tradition. For political philosophy, it provides concrete evidence of how appeals to tradition can mask innovation and serve contemporary political purposes rather than preserving genuine continuity. The Ottoman case is particularly valuable because it shows how even in ostensibly traditional societies, rulers consciously manufactured traditions to achieve modern state-building goals, raising questions about when and whether tradition can provide non-instrumental grounds for authority and legitimacy.

  POSITION: Applies Hobsbawm's invention thesis to show how late Ottoman elites deliberately created traditions to legitimate modernizing reforms, demonstrating that tradition invention is not unique to European nationalism but a widespread state-building strategy.

  title = {Tradition and Agency: Tracing Cultural Continuity and Invention},
  year = {2005},
  publisher = {Aarhus University Press},
  address = {Aarhus},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Otto and Pedersen seek to move beyond the polarized debate between essentialist and constructivist approaches to tradition by developing a framework recognizing both cultural continuity and inventive agency. They argue that traditions involve genuine transmission of practices and meanings while also undergoing continuous modification through agents' creative appropriation and adaptation. The volume examines various cases showing how tradition and innovation interrelate, with agents drawing on received cultural resources to address new circumstances. Neither pure continuity nor pure invention adequately captures how tradition actually operates.

  RELEVANCE: This edited volume represents an important attempt to synthesize insights from both sides of the tradition debates. For political philosophy, the framework suggests that arguments about tradition need not choose between viewing it as static inheritance or pure construction, but can recognize both dimensions. This has implications for assessing tradition's normative force: traditions can embody accumulated wisdom (genuine transmission) while also reflecting power relations and strategic choices (invention). The work provides conceptual resources for avoiding false dichotomies in debates about tradition's role in political justification.

  POSITION: Proposes a synthetic approach recognizing both genuine cultural continuity and inventive agency in tradition, avoiding the extremes of essentialism and radical constructivism while acknowledging the complex interplay between transmission and innovation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume comprehensively examines Edward Shils's contributions to social thought, including his theories of tradition, intellectuals, civil society, and the sacred. Contributors analyze Shils's insistence on society's consensual elements and sacred dimensions even in secular modernity, his conflicts with value-free sociology, and his defense of tradition against modernization narratives. The volume places Shils's work in conversation with figures like Weber, Durkheim, and Parsons while assessing his continuing relevance for understanding contemporary social and political issues.

  RELEVANCE: This collection provides the most comprehensive recent treatment of Shils's social thought and its continuing significance. For political philosophy, the volume demonstrates how Shils's sociological defense of tradition connects to broader questions about meaning, solidarity, and legitimate authority in modern societies. Multiple chapters explore how Shils's account of tradition as sacred and consensual relates to political theory debates about liberalism, conservatism, and communitarianism. Essential for understanding the most systematic sociological theory of tradition and its philosophical implications.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Breuer provides a comprehensive analysis of Weber's sociology of domination (Herrschaft), clarifying the relationship between domination and power, and explaining the three pure types of legal, traditional, and charismatic domination along with their organizational structures. He shows how Weber's framework remains relevant for analyzing contemporary forms of domination, including tendencies toward weakening legal formalism and the emergence of new forms of charismatic and traditional authority. The article addresses common misinterpretations and demonstrates the framework's continued applicability across diverse scientific and cultural research fields.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides authoritative clarification of Weber's domination typology and demonstrates its continuing value for political analysis. For political philosophy, Breuer's analysis shows how Weber's framework can illuminate contemporary phenomena including populism, personalistic leadership, and the reassertion of traditional forms of legitimation within ostensibly modern political systems. The article helps political theorists avoid misusing Weber's concepts while drawing on the framework's insights about different bases of legitimate authority and their relationship to freedom, equality, and rationality.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This programmatic statement elaborates and defends the theory of reflexive modernization against critics. The authors distinguish between three types of modernization: simple modernization (tradition to industrial modernity), reflexive modernization (industrial modernity to risk society), and normative modernization (political projects of modernity). They argue that reflexive modernization involves unintended consequences and side effects of industrial modernization that undermine its own foundations, leading to "individualization," "globalization," and the transformation of politics into "subpolitics." Crucially, they emphasize that reflexivity is not primarily cognitive but structural—modernization reflexively transforms its own conditions.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides crucial conceptual clarification of reflexive modernization theory, distinguishing it from postmodernism and showing its continued commitment to Enlightenment ideals. For tradition studies, it demonstrates how traditions are not simply eliminated but "disembedded" and "re-embedded" in new institutional contexts. The concept of "individualization" is particularly important for understanding how traditional community forms give way to choice-based associations, yet how this very process creates new dependencies and new forms of tradition.

  volume = {129},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--29},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Eisenstadt challenges the classical assumption that modernization necessarily leads to convergence on a Western model, instead proposing that there are "multiple modernities"—distinct patterns of modernity shaped by different cultural programs and civilizational backgrounds. He argues that while modernity originated in the West, its crystallization in different societies has been shaped by specific cultural premises and historical experiences, particularly religious traditions (Christian, Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, Buddhist). These cultural programs are not merely "traditional residues" but actively shape the institutional contours of modernity. The pattern of Western modernity is thus one among many possible patterns, not a universal template.

  RELEVANCE: This framework fundamentally challenges the tradition-modernity binary by showing that "tradition" (understood as civilizational and cultural programs) does not disappear with modernization but rather shapes the specific form that modernity takes in different contexts. For political philosophy, this implies that appeals to tradition cannot be dismissed as inherently anti-modern, nor can modern political institutions be understood in abstraction from their civilizational contexts. The multiple modernities framework also challenges Eurocentric assumptions that have dominated both modernization theory and much political theory.

  POSITION: Represents the multiple modernities paradigm, which has become highly influential in comparative sociology, historical sociology, and area studies. Offers an alternative to both classical modernization theory and postmodern rejection of modernity.

  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511993039},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Based on comprehensive quantitative analysis of 175 governments worldwide from 1990-2002, Fox demonstrates that government involvement in religion is ubiquitous and increased during this period. Only a minority of states—including a minority of democracies—maintain separation of religion and state. The book documents four forms of government involvement: official state religions, preferential treatment of some religions, religious discrimination against minorities, and religious legislation. These findings directly contradict predictions of modernization and secularization theory, which expected religion's public role to decline with development.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical work provides crucial evidence against the secularization thesis, a core component of classical modernization theory that predicted religion would decline with modernization. The persistence and even growth of government-religion entanglement challenges simplistic narratives of tradition (religion) giving way to modernity (secular rationality). For political philosophy, it demonstrates that normative theories must grapple with the empirical reality that most modern states do not conform to strict church-state separation. The data shows tradition-modernity relations are far more complex than linear displacement models suggest.

  POSITION: Represents empirical challenge to secularization theory within the sociology of religion, showing through cross-national quantitative data that modernization does not necessarily lead to religious decline or privatization.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Casanova examines three alternative frameworks for understanding global order: cosmopolitanism (based on theories of universal secular modernization), Huntington's "clash of civilizations" (emphasizing permanent incompatibility between civilization-based modernities), and Eisenstadt's "multiple modernities" (recognizing different civilizational paths to modernity). He argues that cosmopolitan theories, while universalist, remain tied to secularist assumptions that view resistant religions as dangerous fundamentalism. The multiple modernities framework offers a superior alternative by recognizing the continuing relevance of world religions while avoiding Huntington's essentialist civilizational determinism.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis helps situate debates about tradition and modernity within broader frameworks of global theory. It shows how different theoretical approaches to modernity carry different normative implications for how we understand and evaluate traditional (especially religious) claims in modern societies. For political philosophy, it suggests that neither secular universalism nor civilizational particularism adequately captures the complex relationship between traditional religious identities and modern political forms. The article demonstrates the continuing salience of religious traditions in shaping modern political orders.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using 50 years of German data, Pollack and Pickel test two competing theories of religious change: the secularization thesis (modernization leads to religious decline) and the individualization thesis (traditional institutionalized religion is replaced by subjective, non-church spirituality). They find that individualized non-church religiosity remains marginal and is interwoven with traditional Christian religiosity rather than replacing it. The rise of individualized religion cannot compensate for losses in institutional religiosity. They conclude that religious individualization is only a component within a predominant secularization process, not an alternative to it.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical study provides crucial nuance to debates about tradition and modernity by showing that the transformation of tradition takes specific forms that vary by context. While it supports secularization in the German case, it demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of religious change (decline vs. transformation vs. privatization). For political philosophy, it suggests that claims about tradition's "persistence" must specify what form that persistence takes—individualized spiritual seeking is qualitatively different from traditional institutional religiosity and has different political implications.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive comparative study examines religious change in Western and Eastern Europe, the United States, South Korea, Poland, Russia, and the spread of Pentecostalism in Europe, the US, and Brazil. Against recent scholarly skepticism about secularization theory, Pollack and Rosta argue that modernization processes—particularly functional differentiation, individualization, and pluralization—do inhibit religious participation and belief, even in cases often cited as counterexamples (Poland, Russia, USA, South Korea). They show that these societies display clear signs of religious decline when examined carefully, supporting a revised secularization thesis.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the most comprehensive recent empirical investigations of the secularization thesis, directly addressing the tradition-modernity relationship through the lens of religion. By examining diverse cases (not just Western Europe), it tests whether modernity necessarily undermines tradition. The finding that even seemingly religious modern societies show signs of decline suggests that the tension between modernity and (religious) tradition may be deeper than multiple modernities theorists acknowledge. For political philosophy, it raises difficult questions about whether appeals to religious tradition can remain viable in modern pluralistic societies undergoing these structural transformations.

  POSITION: Represents sophisticated neo-secularization theory that responds to critiques while defending core insights about modernization's effects on religion. Important empirical contribution to debates about modernity and tradition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bracke examines how young Evangelical and Islamic women in the Netherlands articulate faith-centered perspectives that incorporate and produce modernity rather than opposing it. She argues for rethinking the modern-secular and religious-traditional binaries that structure much social theory. Drawing on ethnographic research, she shows how these women construct a "pious modern" that challenges assumptions linking modernization with secularization. This requires reconceptualizing both agency and subjectivity beyond secular assumptions embedded in feminist and critical theory. The "post-secular" marks a new disarticulation between the modern and the secular.

  RELEVANCE: This article challenges the assumption that tradition (especially religious tradition) is necessarily opposed to or undermined by modernity. Instead, it shows how religious actors actively construct modern identities and practices from within religious frameworks. For political philosophy, this problematizes any theory that treats tradition and modernity as mutually exclusive or that assumes modern political participation requires secularization. The concept of "pious modernity" suggests that tradition and modernity can be conjugated in ways that neither classical modernization theory nor communitarian tradition-defense anticipated.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This historiographical review demonstrates that historical research across multiple periods and themes has produced findings radically inconsistent with the sociological secularization thesis. Clark argues that the secularization model—which located the beginnings of secularization in early modernity and saw its completion in the 19th-20th centuries—is finally untenable. He proposes a broader, more historical conception of "religion" that can accommodate both persistent religiosity and undoubted changes in religious behavior. The article shows how an older historical scenario linking early modern rationalization to eventual religious decline fails to match empirical evidence.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides crucial historical perspective on the secularization thesis, showing that what appeared as a coherent "grand narrative" from a mid-20th century sociological vantage point collapses when confronted with detailed historical evidence. For understanding tradition and modernity, this suggests that the very periodization underlying modernization theory (a transition from "traditional" to "modern" society) may be historiographically flawed. It demonstrates the importance of empirical historical research for evaluating theoretical claims about tradition-modernity relations.

  POSITION: Represents historical critique of sociological secularization theory from within historical scholarship. Part of broader "religious turn" in historiography that challenges earlier narratives of inevitable secularization.

  doi = {10.1177/0037768607089738},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Woodhead argues that secularization theory successfully explains male disaffiliation from Christianity following industrialization but ignores women's different experience of modernization. While men moved into paid labor outside the home, women remained responsible for unpaid care work within it. Women's entrance into paid labor since the 1960s has not relieved them of traditional care duties. Women's patterns of religious affiliation and disaffiliation are best understood in relation to their working lives and their negotiation between domestic employment and paid labor. Taking gender seriously reveals both strengths and limitations of secularization theory.

  RELEVANCE: This gendered analysis reveals that the tradition-modernity transition was experienced differently by men and women, challenging universal narratives of secularization and modernization. It demonstrates that "tradition" (here, traditional gender roles and religious participation) persists and transforms in gendered ways that standard modernization theories miss. For political philosophy, this suggests that any adequate account of tradition must attend to how it is gendered and how gender shapes both the preservation and transformation of traditional practices. The article shows the importance of intersectional analysis for understanding tradition-modernity relations.

  POSITION: Represents feminist sociology of religion that both engages with and critiques secularization theory by introducing gender as a central analytical category.

  pages = {248--266},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: George examines how Ashis Nandy and other postcolonial scholars constructed tradition and modernity as antagonistic, viewing modernity as a colonial imposition. Against this, she presents Ambedkarite scholarship showing how B.R. Ambedkar synthesized tradition and modernity, incorporating modern liberalism's promise of individual liberation while not dismissing the communal collective self constructed by traditions. The article questions whether postcolonial theory's anxiety about modernity prevents it from claiming modernity's emancipatory potential. Ambedkar demonstrates a middle ground between rejecting modernity as colonial and accepting it uncritically.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how the tradition-modernity binary itself can be a product of colonial power relations and how postcolonial critiques sometimes over-correct by romanticizing tradition. Ambedkar's position—embracing modernity's emancipatory dimensions while criticizing oppressive traditional hierarchies (caste)—offers an alternative to both modernization theory and anti-modern postcolonialism. For political philosophy, this suggests that tradition and modernity need not be antagonistic and that the binary itself may obscure more complex possibilities for synthesis. The Ambedkarite position shows how subordinated groups may have strong reasons to embrace aspects of modernity against oppressive traditions.

  POSITION: Represents postcolonial and Dalit political thought that critiques both colonial modernity and oppressive traditional hierarchies, seeking a synthetic position.

  title = {Tradition and Modernity: Philosophical Reflections on the African Experience},
  year = {1997},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gyekye offers a philosophical interpretation of the African cultural experience in relation to tradition and modernity. He argues against both uncritical embrace of Western modernity and romanticized defense of African tradition. Instead, he proposes a critical approach that evaluates both traditional and modern elements based on their contribution to human flourishing. Gyekye addresses concrete problems in postcolonial African states: ethnicity and nation-building, the relationship of tradition to modernity, political authority and legitimation, corruption, and threats to traditional values from rapid social change. He advocates for selective retention of valuable traditional practices while embracing beneficial modern innovations.

  RELEVANCE: This work exemplifies philosophical engagement with tradition-modernity relations from a non-Western perspective, showing how the debate plays out differently in postcolonial contexts. Gyekye's moderate position—neither wholesale acceptance of Western modernity nor reactionary defense of all tradition—demonstrates that tradition and modernity can be evaluated critically and synthesized selectively. For political philosophy, this provides a model for how to navigate tradition-modernity tensions in a normatively sophisticated way that avoids both Eurocentrism and cultural relativism. The African experience reveals that tradition-modernity is not merely an analytical question but a practical political challenge.

  title = {The Past in Ruins: Tradition and the Critique of Modernity},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {University of Massachusetts Press},
  address = {Amherst},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gross examines how tradition has been conceptualized, criticized, and appropriated in Western thought from the Enlightenment through postmodernity. He analyzes nine different strategies for relating to tradition in modernity: from outright rejection (Enlightenment rationalism) to romantic revival, from conservative defense to radical subversion. Gross shows how modernity's relationship to tradition has been dialectical rather than simply antagonistic—even modernist movements that claimed to break with tradition often created new traditions. He explores how thinkers have sought to "reappropriate tradition through its traces" and develop "subversive genealogies" that critique modernity from within traditional resources.

  RELEVANCE: This intellectual history provides essential context for understanding how "tradition" has been constructed as a concept in relation to modernity. It reveals that neither tradition nor modernity are stable categories but rather contested concepts that have been defined and redefined through their mutual opposition. For political philosophy, this genealogical approach shows that appeals to tradition are never simple returns to a pre-modern past but always involve selective interpretation and reappropriation. The book demonstrates that the critique of modernity has often drawn on traditional resources, complicating simple narratives of tradition's obsolescence.

  volume = {12},
  number = {1},
  pages = {23--42},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argyrou argues that the tradition-modernity binary itself is a product of European hegemony and functions to reproduce hierarchical relations between "modern" European societies and "traditional" Mediterranean ones. Drawing on Cypriot ethnography, he shows how the discourse of tradition vs. modernity positions non-Western or peripheral European societies as backward and in need of modernization. This discourse conceals power relations by presenting cultural differences as temporal stages. The very categories of tradition and modernity are thus ideological constructs that serve hegemonic purposes rather than neutral analytical tools.

  RELEVANCE: This postcolonial critique reveals that the tradition-modernity opposition itself may be a mechanism of power rather than a descriptive framework. For political philosophy, this suggests that uncritical use of the tradition-modernity binary may reproduce problematic hierarchies. The article demonstrates the importance of examining how concepts of tradition and modernity function politically and ideologically, not just analytically. It challenges the assumption that these categories are culturally neutral or universally applicable, showing how they emerged from specific European historical experiences and projects of domination.

  POSITION: Represents postcolonial and critical anthropological critique of tradition-modernity binary as ideological construct serving hegemonic purposes.

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1163/9789004301078},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Duara examines how Asian religious and philosophical traditions (particularly from Sinosphere civilizations—China, Korea, Japan) can contribute to addressing the sustainability crisis of global modernity. He argues that the transcendent ideals embedded in Asian traditions—emphasizing harmony with nature, cyclical time, and interdependence—offer resources for reimagining modernity's relationship with the natural world. However, he also critically examines how these traditions were transformed by nationalist modernization projects in the 20th century. Duara advocates for a "dialogical transcendence" that critically retrieves traditional cosmological and ethical resources while engaging with modern concerns.

  RELEVANCE: This work demonstrates how traditional resources (Asian religious and philosophical traditions) can be critically appropriated to address distinctively modern problems (environmental crisis). It challenges the assumption that tradition is merely backward-looking or that modernity requires complete abandonment of traditional worldviews. For political philosophy, it suggests that normative resources for addressing contemporary challenges may be found in dialogue between traditional and modern thought, rather than privileging one over the other. The book shows how tradition-modernity is not merely a historical or sociological question but has profound implications for urgent global challenges.

  POSITION: Represents effort to retrieve traditional resources for contemporary problems, influenced by both multiple modernities framework and environmental humanities. Offers dialogical approach to tradition-modernity relations.

  volume = {36},
  pages = {69--89},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102629},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Timmermans and Epstein develop a sociological framework for understanding standards and standardization as tools for regulating and organizing social life in modernity. Against assumptions that standardization produces global convergence, they show through diverse empirical cases that standards have multiple, often unintended consequences. Standardization processes must be understood in their specific social, political, and economic contexts. The spread of standards does not produce a "standard world" but rather generates new forms of variation, resistance, and adaptation. Standards are sites of contestation where power relations are enacted and challenged.

  RELEVANCE: While not explicitly about tradition and modernity, this article illuminates how modernization processes work through standardization while producing heterogeneous outcomes rather than convergence. It helps explain how global modernity can coexist with persistent local traditions—standardization does not eliminate variation but reconfigures it. For understanding tradition in modern societies, this framework suggests that even universal modern institutions (standards, bureaucracies, markets) are always implemented through particular cultural contexts that shape their meaning and effects. The persistence of "non-standard" traditional practices within standardized modern institutions becomes intelligible.

  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197547045.003.0004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Inglehart presents an evolutionary theory of modernization that explains value change as driven by changes in existential security. Throughout history, most people lived near starvation, but postwar prosperity and welfare states in advanced industrial societies launched an intergenerational shift from survival values to self-expression values. This is linked to secularization: as existential security increases, people have less need for the security provided by religion. However, Inglehart's theory is more nuanced than classical secularization theory—it predicts that societies with low existential security will remain religious even if economically developing, explaining persistent religiosity in the USA and much of the developing world.

  RELEVANCE: This revised modernization theory offers a more sophisticated account of tradition-modernity relations than classical versions. Rather than predicting universal convergence on secular modernity, it explains variation in religious persistence based on existential security. This helps explain why some modern societies secularize while others remain religious, and why within societies, more secure groups (educated, wealthy) tend to be less religious. For political philosophy, it suggests that tradition's (especially religion's) persistence or decline is not merely cultural but rooted in material conditions of security and development.

  title = {Modernity and the Reinvention of Tradition: Backing into the Future},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Prickett examines how European intellectuals in the 18th-19th centuries invented and reinvented concepts of "tradition" in response to modernity. Rather than tradition being a stable inheritance from the past, he shows how figures like Herder, Schleiermacher, Coleridge, Newman, and Arnold actively constructed notions of Christian tradition, national tradition, and cultural tradition as responses to Enlightenment rationalism and social change. These "invented traditions" were attempts to provide continuity and meaning in conditions of rapid modernization. Prickett reveals the modern origins of what presented itself as ancient tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This intellectual history demonstrates that "tradition" itself is often a modern construction—a product of modernity's anxieties and needs rather than a pre-modern inheritance. This complicates political philosophical appeals to tradition by showing that what appears as ancient and unchanging is often recently invented. The book reveals the dialectical relationship between tradition and modernity: modernity generates need for tradition, and tradition is reinvented to serve modern purposes. For understanding the concept of tradition, this work shows that tradition is not simply what is handed down but what is actively constructed, often in reaction to social change.

  translator = {Weinsheimer, Joel and Marshall, Donald G.},
  publisher = {Crossroad},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer's magnum opus argues that understanding is fundamentally historical and linguistically mediated, requiring a rehabilitation of prejudice (Vorurteil), authority, and tradition against the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice." The hermeneutic experience involves a "fusion of horizons" between interpreter and text/tradition, where pre-judgments enable rather than obstruct genuine understanding. Tradition is not a constraint on reason but its condition of possibility.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for hermeneutic defenses of tradition. Gadamer's critique of Enlightenment rationalism and his positive account of tradition's role in understanding directly address the central tension in this domain. His concepts of effective-historical consciousness (wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewußtsein) and application (Anwendung) reframe how tradition relates to critical reflection. Essential for understanding all subsequent debates in this domain.

  doi = {10.2307/2107880},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre argues that rationality is always "tradition-constituted" rather than universal and context-independent. Different moral and intellectual traditions (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal) have incommensurable conceptions of justice and rationality. Rational justification occurs within traditions according to their internal standards, and traditions can be rationally superior when they solve problems that rival traditions cannot. Against Enlightenment liberalism, MacIntyre defends the rationality of tradition-bound inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the major alternative to Gadamer's hermeneutic account of tradition-constituted rationality. MacIntyre's focus on moral traditions and his engagement with the history of philosophy (especially Thomism) offer resources for political philosophy's engagement with tradition. His account of epistemological crisis and tradition-transcending rational progress addresses the charge that traditionalism cannot account for critique and reform. Critical for understanding virtue ethics and communitarian approaches to tradition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke provides a systematic exposition and critical assessment of Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, with particular attention to how Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition relates to questions of rationality and critique. She defends Gadamer against charges of conservatism by showing that effective-historical consciousness enables critical reflection on tradition, not just passive acceptance. Warnke explicates how Gadamer's account allows for both belonging to tradition and critical distance from it.

  RELEVANCE: This is the standard secondary source on Gadamer's views of tradition and reason in English-language scholarship. Warnke clarifies Gadamer's position on the Enlightenment critique and shows how his hermeneutics provides resources for rational criticism while avoiding both Enlightenment foundationalism and relativism. Essential for understanding the internal tensions in Gadamer's account and its implications for political theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Habermas challenges Gadamer's claim that hermeneutic understanding is universal by arguing that it lacks resources for ideology-critique. While Gadamer correctly identifies the role of tradition and prejudice in understanding, he fails to account for systematically distorted communication and the ways tradition can embody relations of domination. Habermas argues for supplementing hermeneutics with critical social theory grounded in an ideal of undistorted communication.

  RELEVANCE: This essay crystallizes the key objection to Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition: that it is insufficiently critical and potentially conservative. The Habermas-Gadamer debate frames much subsequent discussion of whether tradition-based rationality can accommodate critique or whether critique requires standing outside tradition. Essential for understanding critical theory's challenge to hermeneutic defenses of tradition and for seeing what is at stake politically in these epistemological debates.

Negru analyzes whether hermeneutics can account for distorted forms of tradition without abandoning its core insights.

  RELEVANCE: Provides focused analysis of the universality claim central to Gadamer's philosophy and to debates about whether tradition-based understanding can be self-critical. The question of universality connects directly to whether hermeneutics can address political questions about ideology, power, and emancipation or whether these require different rational resources.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Nicholas argues that MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted reason can be productively combined with Frankfurt School critical theory to develop a more robust form of substantive rationality. Against Habermas's merely procedural communicative rationality, Nicholas proposes synthesizing MacIntyre's substantive practical rationality with the emancipatory aims of critical theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dunne retrieves Aristotle's distinction between phronesis (practical wisdom) and techne (technical/productive knowledge) to critique the dominance of technical rationality in modernity. He traces how this distinction was recovered by Newman, Collingwood, Arendt, and especially Gadamer, showing how phronesis represents a form of rationality embedded in tradition and practice rather than reducible to method. Dunne examines Habermas's attempt to both appropriate and criticize Gadamer's rehabilitation of phronesis.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates the Aristotelian background to both Gadamer's and MacIntyre's accounts of tradition-based rationality. Dunne shows how the recovery of phronesis challenges Enlightenment conceptions of reason as method-driven and universal. His analysis of the Gadamer-Habermas debate focuses on whether practical wisdom (phronesis) can be separated from tradition or whether it is necessarily tradition-bound.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer argues that hermeneutic understanding is not just one mode of knowledge among others (alongside scientific explanation) but is universal and fundamental to all human understanding. The hermeneutical problem is not limited to textual interpretation but characterizes human existence as such, since we are always interpreting and applying tradition. Against methodological objectivism, Gadamer claims that all understanding involves prejudice, tradition, and application.

  RELEVANCE: This essay states Gadamer's controversial universality claim that provoked Habermas's critique. It is essential for understanding what Gadamer means by the "universality" of hermeneutics and why this matters politically and epistemologically. The essay clarifies that hermeneutic philosophy is not just a methodology for humanities but a fundamental ontology of human understanding that challenges Enlightenment conceptions of reason.

  POSITION: States Gadamer's claim to hermeneutic universality. Argues all understanding is interpretive and tradition-mediated, not just humanistic understanding.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Roqué examines the relationship between linguistic competence and MacIntyre's concept of tradition-constituted rationality. She analyzes how traditions transmit not just explicit doctrines but tacit skills and competences, and how this relates to debates about incommensurability between traditions. The article explores whether linguistic competence can serve as a model for understanding how traditions shape rationality while allowing for learning across traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses an important dimension of tradition-constituted rationality: how traditions are transmitted and how individuals acquire the competences necessary for rational inquiry within a tradition. Roqué's analysis helps clarify what it means to say rationality is "constituted" by tradition and how this relates to questions of translation and communication between traditions. Important for understanding the social-practical dimensions of MacIntyre's epistemology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord examines the political implications of hermeneutic philosophy's rehabilitation of tradition, particularly in Gadamer's work and its influence on Pareyson and Vattimo. He argues that Gadamer's hermeneutics allows for both fidelity to tradition and critical, emancipatory engagement with it. The article shows how tradition's persistence even during social change can be acknowledged without abandoning the possibility of critique and transformation.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the key political worry about hermeneutic defenses of tradition: that they are inherently conservative and cannot accommodate emancipatory politics. Ambord's argument that Gadamer enables both belonging and critique is important for political philosophy's appropriation of hermeneutics. The article shows continuities from Gadamer through later hermeneutic thinkers who explicitly address political questions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Beam compares Gadamer's and MacIntyre's accounts of tradition as a resource for rationality rather than an obstacle to it. The article examines how both thinkers rehabilitate tradition against Enlightenment critiques while developing distinct accounts of how tradition enables rational inquiry. Beam analyzes convergences and divergences between Gadamer's hermeneutic approach and MacIntyre's virtue-ethical approach.

  RELEVANCE: Provides direct comparison of the two major philosophical defenses of tradition-constituted rationality. Useful for seeing how Gadamer and MacIntyre share a common critique of Enlightenment rationalism while differing in their positive accounts.

  CORE ARGUMENT: McCarthy examines Habermas's attempt to "overcome" hermeneutics by supplementing Gadamer's interpretive understanding with systematic empirical-theoretical knowledge. He analyzes Habermas's claim that hermeneutics, while necessary, is insufficient and must be complemented by theories of communicative competence, socialization, social systems, and social evolution. McCarthy assesses whether Habermas successfully goes beyond hermeneutics or whether his critical theory presupposes hermeneutic understanding.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka defends liberal multiculturalism against recent criticisms, arguing it remains the most compelling framework for state-minority relations in Western democracies. He distinguishes between multiculturalism as public policy (which has retreated in some countries) and as political theory (which remains robust). The paper clarifies that liberal multiculturalism is not about celebrating diversity per se, but about ensuring fair terms of integration for immigrants and recognition for national minorities, consistent with liberal egalitarian principles.

  RELEVANCE: Provides authoritative overview of contemporary multiculturalism debates and Kymlicka's influential liberal theory of minority rights. Essential for understanding how leading political theorists conceptualize tradition's accommodation in liberal democracies. Directly addresses whether tradition-based group rights conflict with or extend liberal commitments to equality. Shows how "tradition" functions as grounds for minority claims while being constrained by liberal principles.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the gap between political theory and policy practice in British multiculturalism, arguing that empirical analysis reveals multiculturalism is more resilient than the "retreat" narrative suggests. The authors show that while political rhetoric has shifted, actual policies and legal frameworks continue to accommodate cultural and religious diversity. They critique political theory for being insufficiently attentive to the messy realities of implementation and the ways tradition-based claims are negotiated in practice.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how tradition operates in actual policy contexts beyond theoretical debates. Shows the gap between normative political theory (which asks what should be done) and empirical reality (what is actually done). Relevant for understanding how theoretical concepts of tradition and accommodation translate into institutional practices, and how political rhetoric about tradition can diverge from substantive policy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Draws on anthropology's ontological turn to critique how political theory conceptualizes culture and tradition in multiculturalism debates. Argues that multiculturalism relies on an essentialized, bounded concept of culture that misrepresents how people actually relate to traditions. The ontological turn reveals that cultural differences are not merely different beliefs about a shared world, but different ways of worldmaking. This challenges liberal multiculturalism's assumption that cultural accommodation can be achieved through extending familiar liberal mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamental challenge to how political theorists conceptualize tradition and culture. Shows that the liberal multiculturalism framework may misunderstand what is at stake when minority communities invoke tradition, treating as "cultural preference" what may be ontological commitments. Relevant for questioning whether contemporary political theory has adequately theorized what "tradition" means beyond simply inherited practices or beliefs.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques efforts to "decolonize" political theory through simple inclusion of non-Western thinkers, arguing this approach remains centered on Western political thought as the object of critique. Instead, proposes taking anticolonial political thought seriously on its own terms, examining how thinkers like Gandhi and Fanon developed positive reconstructive projects, not just critiques of the West. Calls for generating theory from the study of postcolonial politics itself rather than simply applying Western frameworks to non-Western contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamental challenge to how political theory engages with non-Western political traditions. Critiques the multiculturalism framework for remaining Western-centric even when attempting to be inclusive. Suggests that political theory's engagement with tradition has been limited by its focus on Western liberal democratic contexts and its treatment of non-Western traditions as "other" to be accommodated rather than as sources of political theory in their own right.

Defends "legal pluralism" whereby highly organized groups' normative systems should be recognized as genuinely legal, not merely tolerated. Distinguished from multiculturalism, subsidiarity, and corporatism.

  RELEVANCE: Offers alternative framework to liberal multiculturalism for conceptualizing how tradition-bearing groups relate to the state.

Argues that normative political theory cannot avoid the "democratic element" because questions of who decides, through what institutions, and via what procedures are inseparable from substantive questions about cultural recognition. Shows that seemingly neutral principles of equal recognition require taking positions on democratic institutional design, electoral systems, referendums, and other political structures.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights how political theory's engagement with tradition and minority rights requires attention to democratic procedures and institutions, not just abstract principles. Relevant for understanding how tradition-based claims are mediated through political institutions and how the design of democracy itself affects which traditions are recognized and how.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "epistemic liberalism" as an alternative to multicultural, nationalist, and liberal egalitarian approaches to cultural diversity. Argues that liberalism should emphasize social complexity rather than cultural diversity or homogeneity. The epistemic tradition (from Hayek, Popper) views the primary purpose of liberal institutions as facilitating the discovery and use of dispersed knowledge.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Draws on Pragmatist philosophy (Peirce, James, Dewey, Mead) to argue for "problem-solving democracy" where public agencies engage citizens in active problem-solving rather than just implementing legislated policies. Pragmatism offers evolutionary, learning-oriented perspective stressing problem-driven, reflexive, and deliberative public action. Revives Pragmatist institutionalism to address democratic malaise, showing how agencies can overcome tensions between centralization and decentralization, engage in strategic problem-solving, and facilitate collaborative governance.

  RELEVANCE: Offers Pragmatist alternative to both liberal and communitarian approaches to tradition and community. Relevant for understanding how American Pragmatist tradition conceptualizes the relationship between inherited practices and democratic experimentation. Pragmatism treats traditions as resources for problem-solving rather than fixed constraints or sources of identity, offering different framework than multiculturalism or republicanism.

  POSITION: Pragmatist democracy emphasizing experimental learning and problem-solving over either liberal proceduralism or communitarian tradition.
