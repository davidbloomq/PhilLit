# Section 3: Philosophical Foundations: What is Intersectionality?

## 3.1 Competing Interpretations of Intersectionality

If technical approaches to intersectional fairness presuppose knowing which groups matter, philosophy might be expected to provide guidance. Instead, philosophical analysis reveals deep disagreements about what intersectionality is, how intersectional groups should be understood, and even whether the concept has determinate boundaries—creating precisely the ontological uncertainty that makes specifying G problematic.

Ruíz (2017) provides a philosophical overview situating intersectionality as a term that "arose within the black feminist intellectual tradition for the purposes of identifying interlocking systems of oppression." As a descriptive term, it "refers to the ways human identity is shaped by multiple social vectors and overlapping identity categories (such as sex, race, class) that may not be readily visible in single-axis formulations of identity." This description, however, leaves open fundamental questions about the metaphysics and epistemology of these "overlapping categories."

May (2014) addresses these questions directly in an influential analysis titled "Intersectionality's Definitional Dilemmas." Her examination of definitional challenges in intersectionality scholarship reveals "tensions between different interpretations and uses of intersectionality." These are not mere semantic disputes—they reflect substantive disagreements about what intersectionality requires both theoretically and practically. The existence of definitional dilemmas at the conceptual level creates immediate problems for operationalization: if scholars disagree about what intersectionality is, how can algorithmic systems determine which intersectional groups warrant fairness consideration?

One influential interpretation emphasizes intersectionality's causal structure. Bright, Malinsky, and Thompson (2016) demonstrate that "some characteristic claims of the intersectionality literature can be interpreted causally" through graphical causal modeling. This formalism "allows claims about the causal effects of occupying intersecting identity categories to be clearly represented and submitted to empirical testing." Their approach offers analytical rigor: if intersectionality makes causal claims, these can be formalized and tested. However, causal modeling requires specifying which variables (identity categories) and which causal pathways to model—decisions that themselves presuppose ontological commitments about which categories and interactions matter.

A competing metaphysical interpretation treats intersectionality through emergence. Jorba and López de Sa (2024) propose "conceiving intersectionality as a general metaphysical framework" where "intersectional experiences emerge from the conjunction of social categories when social structures make them relevant vis-à-vis discrimination and privilege." Their emergence view has three appealing features: "metaphysical neutrality, explanatory flexibility, and methodological openness." Emergence helps explain why intersectional experiences cannot be reduced to additive combinations of separate identity categories—Black women's experiences are not simply Black experiences plus women's experiences, but something emergent from their conjunction in particular social structures.

Yet emergence creates challenges for specification. If intersectional properties emerge based on "social structures," which structures are relevant? In what contexts do particular conjunctions generate emergence? The metaphysical flexibility that makes emergence appealing philosophically creates indeterminacy for practical implementation: there is no algorithm for determining which conjunctions will have emergent properties in which contexts. As Jorba and López de Sa note, their view "helps dissociate intersectionality from specific social constructionist views"—but this very dissociation means emergence does not tell us which groups exist or matter.

Hancock (2007) emphasizes the non-additive nature of intersectionality, distinguishing "intersectionality from additive models of identity and oppression" in her analysis "When Multiplication Doesn't Equal Quick Addition." She examines "intersectionality as a research paradigm with specific methodological commitments" that reject the idea that intersectional identities can be understood by summing separate identity dimensions. This rejection is theoretically important—it explains why fairness approaches that ensure parity on race alone and gender alone can still fail at their intersection. Yet non-additivity compounds the specification problem: if intersectional groups have properties not derivable from their constituent attributes, how do we know which combinations will have such properties without examining each intersection empirically?

Garry (2011) identifies "three characteristic uses of intersectionality: as a metaphor, as a heuristic, and as a paradigm." Each use suggests different answers to what intersectionality is and what it requires. As metaphor, intersectionality helps us see identity as multi-dimensional. As heuristic, it guides analysis to consider multiple identity dimensions simultaneously. As paradigm, it constitutes a comprehensive framework for understanding oppression. These different uses—while not necessarily incompatible—have different implications for determining which groups matter. A metaphorical understanding might be satisfied with considering several major intersections; a heuristic approach might suggest examining additional intersections when initial analysis seems incomplete; a paradigmatic commitment might require systematic consideration of all possible intersections. The multiplicity of uses creates indeterminacy about requirements.

McCall (2005) proposes an influential taxonomy distinguishing "anticategorical, intracategorical, and intercategorical approaches to intersectionality." Anticategorical approaches are skeptical of categories themselves, seeing them as simplifications that obscure complexity. Intracategorical approaches focus on particular intersections to reveal complexity within categories. Intercategorical approaches provisionally accept categories to study relationships among social groups. Each stance implies different answers to which groups should be included in fairness analysis. An anticategorical perspective might resist fixing any definite set of groups; an intracategorical approach might focus on specific intersections identified through qualitative research; an intercategorical approach might work with available demographic categories while acknowledging their limitations. The choice among these approaches is not purely empirical—it involves normative and methodological commitments.

Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall (2013) distinguish "structural, political, and representational dimensions of intersectionality" in a programmatic statement on intersectionality studies. These dimensions address different aspects of how intersecting systems of power operate. Yet the distinction also reveals complexity: should algorithmic fairness address all three dimensions? If so, how? If not, which dimensions have priority? The richness of intersectional analysis in critical theory creates multiple possible interpretations of what intersectional fairness requires in algorithmic contexts.

Bowleg (2008) examines "methodological challenges of qualitative and quantitative intersectionality research," arguing that additive approaches (Black + Lesbian + Woman) "fail to capture intersectional experiences (Black Lesbian Woman)." Her analysis is particularly relevant to algorithmic fairness: if quantitative approaches struggle to capture intersectionality, what hope do algorithmic systems have? Her conclusion—that standard quantitative methods may be inadequate for intersectional analysis—suggests that determining which groups matter may require qualitative understanding that resists algorithmic specification.

## 3.2 Social Ontology of Groups

Debates in social ontology deepen the problem by questioning the very nature of social groups. These debates are not academic hairsplitting—they have direct implications for whether demographic groups can be exhaustively specified through attribute combinations or whether group specification is inherently context-dependent and practice-based.

Haslanger (2012) provides a foundational framework distinguishing "causal (social) construction" from "constitutive (social) construction." Causal construction holds that "social factors are involved in causing a kind to be"; constitutive construction holds that "social factors are 'constitutive' or 'ontological.'" She further distinguishes "construction of representations (ideas, concepts, predicates) from construction of objects (people, categories, events, properties)." These distinctions matter for intersectional fairness: if demographic categories are constitutively constructed rather than merely causally constructed, their existence and properties depend on ongoing social practices rather than being fixed facts about individuals. This makes specifying G a moving target.

Sveinsdóttir (2013, 2015) offers an alternative characterization: "something is socially constructed if it has social significance in a context such that items taken to have the relevant feature get conferred extra social constraints and enablements." On this view, what makes something a social group is not a fixed essence but "social significance in a context." The context-dependence is crucial: a combination of attributes might constitute a meaningful group in one context but not another. For algorithmic fairness, this implies that which intersectional groups matter may vary by domain, geographic context, historical period, and institutional setting—undermining the idea of a universal, stable set G.

Epstein (2019) distinguishes between "type 1 groups" (committees, organizations) that "require volitional membership and structure" and "type 2 groups" (racial, ethnic groups) that lack these characteristics. He argues that "common possession of a racial or ethnic feature constitutes a minimal structure, though attributive rather than relational." This distinction suggests that demographic categories relevant to fairness are type 2 groups united by shared attributes. However, Epstein notes that even attributive structure raises questions: which attributes constitute groups? When do individuals with shared attributes form a group rather than merely a collection? His analysis suggests attribute-based specification may be necessary but not sufficient for group individuation.

Mallon (2007) provides a "field guide to social construction," mapping "different senses of 'social construction' and their philosophical implications." The multiplicity of senses he identifies—causal dependence on social factors, lack of natural kind status, contingency, revisability—reveals that "social construction" is not a univocal thesis but a family of related claims. For algorithmic fairness, this means that appeals to groups being "socially constructed" underdetermine which groups exist and matter. Different senses of construction suggest different answers to group specification questions.

Thomasson (2019) analyzes "what social groups are metaphysically," examining "competing accounts and their implications." She asks whether "groups are sets of individuals, structured entities, or something else." If groups are sets—collections of individuals sharing attributes—then perhaps groups can be derived algorithmically from attribute combinations. If groups are structured entities with properties beyond their members, then group specification may require understanding social structures not reducible to individual attributes. If groups are "something else" (e.g., practices, institutions, ways of being categorized), then attribute-based specification may be fundamentally inadequate.

Sterba (2024) provides recent analysis showing that "group membership and classification are not static but constantly change based on shifts in social identity and context." This dynamic view challenges any attempt to fix a stable set of groups for fairness evaluation. If group boundaries shift with context and time, then specifying G for an algorithmic system requires either (1) continuous updating based on changing social realities or (2) accepting that G will be somewhat arbitrary and potentially obsolete.

Haslanger and Ásta (2017) co-author an overview of feminist metaphysics discussing "how social practices, attitudes, biological regularities, or something else set up or anchor gender categories to be what they are." Their analysis reveals that even for a single demographic dimension (gender), philosophers disagree about what constitutes the category. These disagreements multiply for intersectional categories: if there is no consensus on what makes gender or race what they are, there can be no consensus on what makes "Black women" or "disabled Latina teenagers" the groups they are.

Ritchie (2013) examines the "relationship between social structure and ontology of groups," analyzing "how social structures constitute or constrain groups." If groups are constituted by structures, then understanding which groups exist requires understanding relevant social structures. But social structures are themselves contested objects of analysis, studied across sociology, economics, political science, and critical theory with no unified framework. Algorithmic systems cannot wait for philosophy and social theory to converge on unified accounts—yet proceeding without such accounts means making ontological commitments by default, often implicitly.

**Flag for the Dilemma**: Philosophical analysis reveals ontological uncertainty about intersectional groups at multiple levels. Intersectionality itself is definitionally contested (May 2014). Metaphysical accounts disagree about whether intersectional properties are causal, emergent, or something else (Bright et al. 2016; Jorba and López de Sa 2024). Social ontology offers competing accounts of what constitutes groups—attribute-based, practice-based, structurally constituted (Haslanger 2012; Sveinsdóttir 2013; Epstein 2019; Thomasson 2019). Group boundaries are context-dependent and temporally dynamic (Sterba 2024; Sveinsdóttir 2015). This philosophical landscape creates genuine ontological uncertainty: there is no settled philosophical answer to "which intersectional groups exist and warrant consideration?" Yet notice what this literature does not discuss: the statistical consequences of these ontological choices. Philosophers debate the metaphysics of groups without considering that including more groups in fairness analysis creates statistical challenges. The ontological debates proceed independently of the statistical constraints documented in Section 2. This independence—this failure to recognize the interaction—is central to the gap this review identifies.
