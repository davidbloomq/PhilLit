## Analysis

### Quality of Original Citations

The original BibTeX file had **good citation integrity** with some metadata errors:
- All 17 papers exist and are correctly identified
- All papers are relevant to the domain
- Core bibliographic information (authors, titles) mostly correct
- Main issues: wrong co-authors, wrong years, missing DOIs

### Nature of Errors

The errors appear to be honest mistakes rather than fabrications:
- **Green2022**: Chen may have been confused with co-author on different paper
- **Fazelpour2021**: Fazelpour has multiple papers with Lipton; this one is with Danks
- **Passi2019**: "The Validity of Fairness" sounds plausible for their work
- **Barabas2019**: Partnership on AI did report on this topic, but venue was MIT Media Lab
- **Scheuerman2020**: Paper was published in 2020 but may have been accessed in 2021

### Recommendations

1. **All entries verified**: Every paper exists and is correctly identified
2. **Metadata corrected**: 5 entries had errors that were fixed
3. **DOIs added**: 7 entries were missing DOIs; these were added where available
4. **Ready for Zotero**: File is now ready for production use
