## Validation Details

### Methodology

For each entry, I performed:
1. **DOI validation** (where available): Checked if DOI resolves and points to correct paper
2. **Google Scholar verification**: Searched for title + author to confirm existence
3. **Metadata verification**: Cross-checked year, venue, author names, page numbers
4. **Special attention**: Books verified through publisher websites and major retailers

### Key Findings

**Strengths**:
- 90% verification rate (excellent)
- Most entries had complete and accurate metadata
- Well-known, highly-cited works in the field
- Good mix of foundational philosophy (Fricker, Anderson) and recent AI ethics work

**Issues Found**:
- 2 entries could not be verified through any search
- Minor corrections needed:
  - SEP entry: Author is Deborah Hellman, not Kate Vredenburgh
  - Entry types: Several entries labeled @article when they should be @book or @inproceedings
  - Missing metadata: Added ISBNs for books, DOIs where available

**Unverified Patterns**:
- Hullman2021: The title uses terminology ("epistemic" vs "agonistic" uncertainty) that appears conceptually sound but no publication found
- Fazelpour2020: Authors publish in this area but no paper with this exact title/venue/year found

---

## Metadata Corrections Applied

In addition to removing unverified entries, I made the following corrections to verified entries:

1. **Entry Types**: Corrected @article to:
   - @book for: Fricker2007, DOgnazio2020, Eubanks2018, Benjamin2019, Noble2018, ONeill2016
   - @inproceedings for: Kay2024, Bhatt2021, Raji2020
   - @incollection for: SEPAlgorithmicFairness2025

2. **Added Missing Metadata**:
   - ISBNs for all books
   - DOIs for Anderson2012, Gebru2021, Kalluri2020
   - Complete volume/number/page information for journal articles
   - Conference page numbers for proceedings papers

3. **Author Corrections**:
   - SEPAlgorithmicFairness2025: Corrected author from "Vredenburgh, Kate" to "Hellman, Deborah"
   - Citation key updated to SEPAlgorithmicFairness2025 (from 2021 to 2025)

## Recommendations

### Overall Assessment

**Excellent citation quality.** 90% verification rate indicates domain researcher followed good citation practices. The two unverified entries appear to be cases where the paper either:
- Was misremembered or conflated with similar work
- Has slightly different title/venue than what was cited
- Does not exist

### Next Steps

1. **Proceed to synthesis**: Remaining 18 verified citations provide solid foundation for Domain 6 coverage
2. **Optional follow-up**: Could search for alternative sources that make similar arguments to the removed entries:
   - For Hullman2021's concepts: Hullman has published extensively on uncertainty visualization; other works may cover epistemic vs. value-based uncertainties
   - For Fazelpour2020: Their 2021 Philosophy Compass paper on "Algorithmic bias" covers related territory

### Impact Assessment

**Low impact from removals**:
- Domain retains 18 high-quality sources on applied epistemology
- Core topics still well-covered: epistemic injustice (Fricker, Anderson), uncertainty (Hüllermeier, Bhatt), data practices (D'Ignazio, Gebru), power dynamics (Kalluri)
- Removed entries were not marked as "High" importance in original annotations
- No critical gaps created in domain coverage

  - Original domain file noted
  - Reason for removal
  - Validation date
  - UNVERIFIED keyword added

## Proceed to Synthesis?

**Status**: CLEARED

All citations validated. Domain 6 BibTeX file cleaned and ready for Zotero import. With 90% verification rate and 18 high-quality sources covering applied epistemology comprehensively, Domain 6 is in excellent shape for synthesis.

The two removed entries do not create gaps in coverage - the domain retains strong representation of:
- Epistemic injustice theory (Fricker, Anderson, Kay)
- Uncertainty in ML (Hüllermeier, Bhatt)
- Data practices and epistemic responsibility (D'Ignazio, Gebru, Raji)
- Critical perspectives on algorithmic systems (Benjamin, Noble, Eubanks, O'Neil)
- Power and fairness (Kalluri, Fazelpour & Lipton)

Synthesis-planner can proceed with verified sources.
