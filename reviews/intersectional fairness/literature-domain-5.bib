Unlike egalitarianism, prioritarianism does not require equality per se but weighted concern for worst-off.

Fairness and justice frequently conflated, with consequence that distributive justice concerns not addressed explicitly. Prioritarianism classified as optimization-type theory of distributive justice alongside utilitarianism. Prioritarianism's goal: maximize aggregate utility for all groups, giving greater weight to utility the worse off the group.}

Can be formalized as mathematical formulas allowing patterns like maximin, prioritarianism, or sufficientarianism. Fairness criterion checking if approximately equal shares from all groups are above threshold accounts for structural injustices under sufficientarianism, leading to egalitarian distributive pattern.}
