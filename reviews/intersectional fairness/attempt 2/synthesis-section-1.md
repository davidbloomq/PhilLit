# Introduction: The Challenge of Intersectional Fairness

Algorithmic decision systems—from credit scoring to criminal risk assessment, healthcare triage to hiring—increasingly shape access to critical social goods. As concerns about algorithmic fairness have intensified, researchers have recognized that fairness evaluations focused solely on single demographic attributes (such as race or gender alone) miss crucial dimensions of discrimination. Intersectional groups—individuals characterized by multiple overlapping identity categories—may experience distinct patterns of bias that disappear when groups are analyzed separately (Foulds et al. 2020; Buolamwini and Gebru 2018). This recognition has spurred growing attention to intersectional fairness: ensuring algorithmic systems operate fairly across groups defined by combinations of protected attributes such as race, gender, age, and disability status.

Yet intersectional fairness remains extraordinarily challenging to implement in practice. Recent surveys document persistent difficulties in achieving fairness across intersectional groups, despite sophisticated technical interventions (Gohar and Cheng 2023). This paper argues that these challenges stem from a genuine dilemma involving two distinct forms of uncertainty that interact in problematic ways. First, *statistical uncertainty*: intersectional groups are often small in available datasets, making reliable performance estimation difficult and raising epistemic questions about when inferences are warranted. Second, *ontological uncertainty*: philosophical debates reveal deep disagreement about which groups intersectionality picks out—whether intersectional groups can be exhaustively specified through attribute combinations, or whether they emerge from social practices in ways that resist algorithmic enumeration.

The dilemma arises from the interaction between these two forms of uncertainty. Expanding the set of groups to respect the ontological complexity of intersectionality exacerbates statistical problems: more groups mean less data per group, increasing estimation error and epistemic uncertainty. Conversely, constraining the set of groups to ensure statistical reliability requires principled criteria for deciding which groups to include—criteria that depend on resolving contested philosophical questions about the nature of social groups, distributive justice, and epistemic authority. Improving performance on one horn of this dilemma tends to worsen the situation on the other.

This literature review synthesizes research across machine learning, philosophy, social ontology, measurement theory, normative ethics, and epistemology to show that while each horn of the dilemma is well-recognized in its respective domain, *no existing work frames their interaction as a dilemma*. Machine learning researchers treat group specification as an input to technical fairness problems, not a problem to be solved. Philosophers explore the contested ontology of intersectional groups without addressing operational constraints imposed by data limitations. Measurement theorists recognize that operationalization embeds ontological commitments but do not connect this to the statistical challenges of small groups (Jacobs and Wallach 2021). This review establishes the gap and positions our contribution: the first systematic analysis of intersectional fairness as involving a genuine dilemma where statistical and ontological uncertainties reinforce each other.

The review proceeds as follows. Section 2 surveys technical approaches in machine learning and computer science, showing sophisticated solutions to data sparsity that nevertheless assume groups are given. Section 3 examines philosophical work on intersectionality and social ontology, revealing deep disagreement about what intersectional groups are and how they should be individuated. Section 4 bridges these domains through measurement theory, showing that operationalizing fairness metrics embeds answers to contested ontological questions. Section 5 explores normative frameworks for distributive justice, demonstrating that different theories yield different answers about which groups warrant consideration. Section 6 examines epistemic dimensions, including questions of epistemic justice (who decides which groups matter?) and epistemic responsibility (when is evidence sufficient for claims about small groups?). Section 7 synthesizes these findings to articulate the full dilemma structure and document the gap in existing work. Section 8 concludes by positioning our research contribution.
