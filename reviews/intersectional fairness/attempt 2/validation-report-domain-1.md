## Analysis

### Metadata Quality Assessment

**Verification Rate**: 94.1% (16/17 verified)
**Metadata Accuracy Rate**: 52.9% (9/17 required no changes; 8/17 required corrections)

### Key Findings

1. **High correction rate**: Nearly half the entries (47.1%) required metadata corrections
2. **Author attribution errors**: Most common issue (6 entries had wrong authors)
3. **One critical error**: Lett2025 had completely wrong metadata including a DOI that pointed to an entirely different paper
4. **One unverifiable entry**: Mangal2024 could not be found despite extensive searches

### Concerns

The high rate of metadata errors suggests the domain researcher may have been:
- Working from memory rather than directly checking sources
- Confusing similar papers or authors
- Not verifying DOIs before recording them

The most serious issue was entry Zhang2024/Lett2025 where the DOI (10.1101/2024.11.05.24316769) pointed to a completely different paper about opioid medications, not intersectional fairness.

### Quality Improvements Applied

All verified entries now have:
- Correct author attributions
- Accurate publication years
- Valid DOIs (where available)
- Proper citation keys
- Complete publication details
- UTF-8 encoding for special characters (Hébert, Aurélien, Niccolò)

## Recommendations

### Status: CLEARED for Synthesis

Despite the high metadata correction rate, all corrections have been successfully applied and verified. The domain-1 BibTeX file is now ready for:
1. Zotero import
2. Use in synthesis
3. Citation in final literature review

### Notes on Removed Entry

The removed entry (Mangal2024) focused on:
- ABROCA metric modifications for intersectional fairness
- Adversarial learning for bias mitigation in education

If this topic area is important for the review, consider:
1. Searching for alternative sources on intersectionality in educational ML
2. Looking for other work by these authors (if they exist)
3. Searching for recent BJET articles on ML fairness in education

### Quality Control Recommendations

For future domain research, recommend:
1. Always verify DOIs before recording them
2. Cross-check author names against actual publications
3. Use citation managers or direct database exports to minimize transcription errors
4. Verify recent publications (2024-2025) are correctly dated

- Do not import this file to Zotero

---

## Validation Methodology

For each entry, the following validation steps were performed:

1. **DOI Verification** (where applicable):
   - Tested DOI resolution via https://doi.org/
   - Verified DOI points to correct publication
   - Checked title and authors match BibTeX entry
   - Result: Valid ✓ / Invalid ❌

2. **Google Scholar Verification** (all entries):
   - Searched using title and first author
   - Verified paper exists
   - Confirmed metadata (authors, year, venue)
   - Result: Confirmed ✓ / Not found ❌

3. **Metadata Cross-checking**:
   - Verified against publisher websites
   - Checked arXiv for preprints
   - Confirmed publication venues
   - Validated author lists

4. **Decision Criteria**:
   - **KEEP**: DOI valid AND metadata verified, OR no DOI but clearly verified via Google Scholar
   - **KEEP with corrections**: Paper exists but metadata errors found and corrected
   - **REMOVE**: Cannot verify paper exists OR major unresolvable metadata issues

### Search Tools Used

- Google Scholar
- DOI resolution (doi.org)
- arXiv.org
- IEEE Xplore
- Nature/Springer databases
- PubMed Central
- AAAI/NeurIPS/ICML proceedings

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: PASS

The domain-1 literature file has been successfully validated and cleaned. While metadata quality was initially concerning (47% error rate), all issues were identified and corrected. The final file contains 16 high-quality, verified sources from leading ML/AI venues covering intersectional fairness in algorithmic systems.

The literature base is strong and suitable for synthesis. The removed entry (Mangal2024) does not significantly impact domain coverage as other sources address similar topics (ABROCA metrics, fairness in educational settings, intersectionality-aware approaches).
