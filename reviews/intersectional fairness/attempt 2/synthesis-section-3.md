# Philosophical Foundations of Intersectionality

While machine learning research treats intersectional group specification as a technical input problem, philosophical scholarship reveals deep and unresolved disagreements about what intersectionality is, which groups it picks out, and how those groups should be individuated. This section examines philosophical debates about the nature of intersectionality as a theoretical framework and about the ontology of social groups more broadly. These debates establish that ontological uncertainty about intersectional groups is not a gap in current knowledge to be filled through further research, but rather reflects genuinely contested conceptual terrain where multiple incompatible frameworks have philosophical pedigree.

## Intersectionality as a Contested Concept

The term "intersectionality" originated in Black feminist legal scholarship to identify how individuals with multiple marginalized identities experience forms of oppression that cannot be understood through single-axis frameworks (Crenshaw 1989). Yet what intersectionality requires and what it means to adopt an intersectional approach remain matters of substantial disagreement. As Collins (2015) documents in her analysis of "intersectionality's definitional dilemmas," the concept faces persistent questions about its scope, meaning, and methodological implications. Crenshaw herself characterizes intersectionality not as a theory with determinate implications but as "an analytic sensibility, a way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power" (Crenshaw 2015). This characterization suggests intersectionality functions more as a critical orientation than as a theoretical framework with clear operational consequences.

Philosophical analyses of intersectionality reveal multiple incompatible interpretations. Garry (2011) distinguishes three characteristic uses: as metaphor (intersecting roads), as heuristic (tool for discovery), and as paradigm (comprehensive framework). Each interpretation suggests different relationships between identity categories and lived experience. Ruíz (2017) emphasizes that intersectionality arose within Black feminist thought to identify "interlocking systems of oppression" and notes persistent debates about whether the concept has coherent boundaries or whether it risks becoming diluted through broad application. Cho et al. (2013) distinguish structural, political, and representational dimensions of intersectionality, arguing that different applications may emphasize different dimensions without necessarily contradicting each other. Yet this pluralism about intersectionality's meaning creates uncertainty for operationalization: if intersectionality means different things in different contexts, how should algorithmic fairness researchers operationalize it?

Perhaps the most consequential philosophical disagreement concerns what McCall (2005) identifies as three distinct approaches to categories in intersectional analysis. The *anticategorical* approach rejects fixed categories altogether, viewing them as reifying social constructions that obscure the fluidity and complexity of lived experience. From this perspective, attempting to enumerate intersectional groups for algorithmic fairness analysis fundamentally misunderstands intersectionality, which critiques rather than reproduces categorical thinking. The *intracategorical* approach focuses on particular intersections as case studies—studying the specific experiences of, say, Black lesbian women—without presuming that all possible intersections are equally meaningful or that they can be exhaustively enumerated. The *intercategorical* approach provisionally adopts existing categories to analyze inequality patterns across groups, acknowledging that categories are constructed but treating them as analytically useful.

Of these three approaches, only the intercategorical appears compatible with algorithmic fairness applications that require specifying discrete groups for performance evaluation. Yet even the intercategorical approach is "provisional"—it uses categories as analytical tools without claiming they carve nature at its joints or exhaust meaningful group identities. This provisionality creates tension for algorithmic systems that must make definite commitments about which groups to monitor. The anticategorical approach would reject the entire enterprise of group-based fairness metrics as misconceived. The intracategorical approach might accept studying specific intersections but would resist the idea that we can or should enumerate all intersections warranting consideration. Only by adopting the intercategorical approach—which intersectionality theorists recognize as one option among several—can algorithmic fairness research proceed, and even then without strong ontological commitments about which group categories are real or fundamental.

## Causal versus Emergent Interpretations

A more specific philosophical debate concerns whether intersectional groups should be understood through causal-combinatorial frameworks or through emergence frameworks. This debate has direct implications for whether intersectional groups can be specified algorithmically through attribute combinations.

Bright et al. (2016) propose interpreting intersectionality through graphical causal models, arguing that characteristic claims in intersectionality literature can be understood as claims about causal effects of occupying intersecting identity categories. For instance, the claim that Black women face distinct forms of discrimination can be interpreted as asserting that race and gender causally interact in producing outcomes: being both Black and a woman has effects not reducible to the sum of being Black plus being a woman. This interpretation is explicitly designed to make intersectionality theory amenable to empirical testing through standard causal inference techniques. Importantly, it suggests that intersectional groups can be specified through combinations of attributes: if we know an individual's race and gender, we can place them in the appropriate intersectional category for analyzing causal effects.

However, this causal-combinatorial interpretation faces challenges from emergence-based accounts. Jorba and López de Sa (2024) argue for "intersectionality as emergence," proposing that intersectional experiences emerge from the conjunction of social categories when social structures make them relevant vis-à-vis discrimination and privilege. On their account, intersectionality is not merely about causal interactions between attributes but about emergent properties that arise from social structures. An intersectional group like "Black women" is not simply the set of individuals who are both Black and women; it is a group constituted through social practices and structures that treat Black women as a distinct category. This emergent interpretation is explicitly metaphysically neutral—it does not presuppose specific views about social construction—but it suggests that intersectional groups cannot be exhaustively enumerated through attribute combinations. Which groups emerge depends on context-specific social structures, not on combinatorial logic.

The tension between these interpretations becomes clear in Hancock's (2007) analysis of "when multiplication doesn't equal quick addition." Hancock argues that intersectionality fundamentally rejects additive models where, for example, being a Black woman equals being Black plus being a woman. Instead, intersectional identities involve non-additive interactions that create distinct experiences. Bowleg (2008) makes this point vivid with her formulation: "Black + Lesbian + Woman ≠ Black Lesbian Woman." The left side represents an additive model; the right side represents an intersectional identity that cannot be decomposed into its constituent parts.

For algorithmic fairness, this philosophical disagreement matters enormously. If the causal-combinatorial interpretation is correct, then in principle we can specify intersectional groups through database queries combining protected attributes: WHERE race='Black' AND gender='Female' picks out the group. If the emergence interpretation is correct, then intersectional groups depend on social contexts and practices in ways that resist algorithmic enumeration. We cannot determine which groups exist merely by examining our dataset attributes; we need substantive knowledge of social structures and how they constitute groups. The philosophical debate between these interpretations is not settled, leaving deep uncertainty about the ontology of intersectional groups.

## Social Ontology of Groups

Debates about intersectionality connect to broader philosophical questions in social ontology about the nature and individuation of social groups. How are social groups constituted? Can membership in social groups be determined through individuals' attributes, or do groups depend on social relations, practices, or structures that transcend individual properties?

Epstein (2019) distinguishes between two types of social groups. Type 1 groups—such as committees, corporations, or sports teams—have clear membership criteria, organizational structure, and often require volitional participation. Type 2 groups—such as racial or ethnic groups—lack these features. For type 2 groups, Epstein argues that "common possession of the racial or ethnic feature constitutes at least a minimal structure," though this structure is "attributive rather than relational." This analysis suggests that demographic groups like "Black" or "women" can be individuated through attributes (racial or gender features), supporting the idea that intersectional combinations of these attributes also define groups.

However, other accounts of social group ontology resist attribute-based individuation. Ritchie (2020) develops a structuralist ontology where social groups are constituted by social structures—networks of relations constitutively dependent on social factors. On this view, what makes someone a member of a group is not possession of intrinsic attributes but rather their position in social structures. Thomasson (2019) surveys competing accounts of what social groups are metaphysically, noting fundamental disagreements about whether groups are sets of individuals, structured entities, mereological sums, or something else entirely. Different accounts yield different answers to questions about group identity and persistence over time.

Haslanger (2012) distinguishes between causal social construction (where social factors cause kinds to exist) and constitutive social construction (where social factors are ontologically constitutive of kinds). She further distinguishes construction of representations (concepts, categories) from construction of objects (people, groups, properties). Applying this framework to race and gender, Haslanger argues these categories are both causally and constitutively socially constructed. For algorithmic fairness, this raises questions about whether database categories for race and gender successfully refer to socially constructed groups or merely represent contested conceptual schemes.

Sveinsdóttir's (2013) conferralist account of social construction offers yet another framework. On her view, something is socially constructed if it has social significance in a context such that items taken to have the relevant feature are conferred extra social constraints and enablements. This account makes group membership depend on context-specific social practices of conferral rather than on intrinsic attributes or even stable social structures. Whether someone is treated as a member of a group depends on local practices, suggesting that group membership may not be algorithmically determinable from demographic data alone.

Debates in feminist metaphysics further complicate the picture. As Haslanger and Ásta (2017) document, philosophers disagree profoundly about how social practices, attitudes, biological regularities, or other factors "set up or anchor" gender and race categories. Mikkola (2016) reviews feminist debates about whether gender is best understood through attribute-based accounts (possession of certain biological, psychological, or social features) or through practice-based accounts (participation in gendered social practices). These debates have direct analogues for intersectional groups: should "Black women" be understood as individuals possessing both racial and gender attributes, or as individuals participating in social practices specific to Black women?

## Implications for Algorithmic Fairness

The philosophical literature on intersectionality and social ontology establishes several conclusions relevant to algorithmic fairness. First, there is no philosophical consensus on what intersectionality is or what it requires. Multiple interpretive frameworks—anticategorical, intracategorical, intercategorical—coexist, and only one (intercategorical) is clearly compatible with algorithmic fairness metrics requiring enumerated groups. Second, even among those who accept the intercategorical approach, there is deep disagreement about whether intersectional groups are constituted through attribute combinations (supporting algorithmic enumeration) or through emergent social structures and practices (resisting it). Third, broader social ontology debates reveal fundamental disagreements about how social groups are individuated, with some accounts supporting attribute-based specification and others requiring attention to context-specific social relations and practices.

These are not gaps in current knowledge that further empirical or philosophical research might fill. They are genuinely contested areas where multiple incompatible positions have strong philosophical arguments supporting them. Machine learning researchers cannot simply wait for philosophers to resolve these debates and then implement the consensus answer. The debates may be irresolvable in principle, reflecting different legitimate purposes for theorizing about groups and different normative commitments about what matters morally.

For algorithmic fairness research, this creates profound ontological uncertainty. When we ask "which intersectional groups should we evaluate for fairness?", we are asking a question that presupposes answers to contested philosophical questions about group ontology. Different philosophical frameworks give different answers. An attribute-based ontology suggests we can enumerate groups through combinations: all individuals with race=Black AND gender=Female form a group. A practice-based or structural ontology suggests groups cannot be enumerated this way; which groups exist depends on context-specific social structures that the algorithm cannot access through demographic attributes alone. A conferralist account suggests group membership depends on local practices of social conferral that vary across contexts.

The machine learning literature treats group specification as a technical input problem, assuming that we know which groups to consider (ideally all attribute combinations, practically constrained by data availability). The philosophical literature reveals this assumption is untenable. We face deep ontological uncertainty about which groups exist and how they should be individuated. This uncertainty is not merely about what is true but about which framework for understanding groups is appropriate for algorithmic fairness contexts. As we will see in subsequent sections, this ontological uncertainty interacts with measurement challenges (Section 4), normative questions about distributive justice (Section 5), and epistemic questions about authority and responsibility (Section 6) to create a genuine dilemma for intersectional fairness.
