  title = {Causally Interpreting Intersectionality Theory},

  journal = {Philosophy of Science},

  number = {1},
  pages = {60--81},
  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.1086/684173},
  note = {Seminal paper showing characteristic claims of intersectionality literature can be interpreted causally. Graphical causal modeling allows claims about causal effects of occupying intersecting identity categories to be clearly represented and empirically tested. Alleviates difficulties in drawing testable predictions from intersectionality theory. Addresses concerns about membership in demographic categories having causal effects.}

  note = {Proposes conceiving intersectionality as general metaphysical framework. Main claim: intersectional experiences emerge from conjunction of social categories when social structures make them relevant vis-à-vis discrimination and privilege. Three virtues: metaphysical neutrality, explanatory flexibility, methodological openness. Helps dissociate intersectionality from specific social constructionist views.}
