      "abstract": "The deliberative systems approach is a recent innovation within the tradition of deliberative democratic theory. It signals an important shift in focus from the political legitimacy produced within isolated and formal sites of deliberation (e.g., Parliament or deliberative mini-publics), to the legitimacy produced by a number of diverse interconnected sites. In this respect, the deliberative systems (DS) approach is better equipped to identify and address defects arising from the systemic influences of power and coercion. In this article, I examine one of the least explored and least understood defects: the exclusion of non-speaking political actors generated by the uniform privileging of speech in all sites within a system. Using the examples of prefigurative protest, Indigenous refusal to deliberate, and the non-deliberative agency of disabled citizens, I argue that the DS approach allows theorists to better understand forms of domination related to the imposition of speech on those who are either unwilling or unable to speak.",

      "abstract": "Democracy in Theory and Practice presents an authoritative overview of democratic theory today. Its distinctive approach links theory to practice, emphasizing the wide variety of institutions and procedures through which core democratic principles are implemented and the normative and practical dimensions of the choices to be made among these alternatives. Designed for courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level, the book features eighteen chapters organized thematically and divided into sections and subsections for easy reference; historical and current examples, citations for specific ideas, annotated references, and further readings throughout enhance the volume's utility for students, scholars, and researchers. Sidebars give biographical sketches of classic theorists and democratic ideas from the US founders and constitutional tradition. Featured topics discussed include: Majority Rule; Participation; Deliberation; Accountability; Representation; Constitutionalism; Electoral Laws; Parties; Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Functions. The Boundary Problem; The \"All-Affected\" Principle; Contested Senses of Liberal and Procedural Democracy; The Pros and Cons of Term Limits; Proportional Representation; Referendums; Problems of Democratic Transparency and Reversibility. Written by a leading authority in the field, Frederick G. Whelan encourages us to think of the many alternative ways of putting democracy into practice and of these alternatives as requiring choices. This diversity means that there is no unique or correct democratic outcome from a given set of preferences, since outcomes are shaped by the methods followed in reaching them.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growth in movements like Zapatismo, 21st Century Socialism, the Movement of the Squares, Occupy, and others who combine commitments to a radical conception of democracy, human emancipation, and what is sometimes called \"prefigurative politics.\" Prefigurative politics is discussed among the anarchists prominent in Occupy (Bray, 2013; Graeber, 2009, 2013; Maeckelbergh, 2011, 2012; van der Sande, Sitrin, & Azzellini, 2014; Yates, 2015; 2015); Zapatismo and other Latin American social movements (Holloway, 2010; Sitrin, 2012; Zibechi, 2012); and anarchist and syndicalist organizations (Ness, 2014); autonomist Marxists (Holloway, 2010; Negri, 2009); theorists of 21st Century Socialism (Lebowitz, 2010, 2010; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, 1995) and even some progressive Trotskyists (Swain, 2015). The aim of this article was to develop three arguments for the necessity of prefigurative politics for bringing about the kind of free and democratic socialist society envisioned by many of the aforementioned groups and thinkers, on the basis of Karl Marx's theory of practice.1 These three arguments address the importance of prefigurative politics for radically free and democratic social change. Prefigurative politics is important for developing (a) revolutionary subjects with the powers and capacities needed to organize a radically free and democratic society; (b) revolutionary subjects with the required needs and motivations to work to bring such a society about; and (b) this sort of socialist consciousness. This article shows how certain components of Marx's thought are relevant and interesting to the theory and practice of radical democratic movements today, showing non-Marxist radical thinkers how Marx's theory of practice can help to make sense of and contribute to the important topic of prefigurative politics, and thereby helping to bring this aspect of Marx's thought into dialogue with some related radical democratic and anarchist thought. In fact, since I believe the original anarchist arguments for prefigurative politics spring from a theory of practice shared by Marx and Bakunin (Schmidt & van der Walt, 2009),2 I contend that this offers a potentially fruitful way of bringing Marxism and anarchism into, if not convergence, at least closer contact (Franks, 2012, Ness, 2014; Prichard, & Worth, 2016). Prefigurative politics is a key point of disagreement between anarchists and many Marxists, going back to debates in the First International (see Eckhardt, 2016), but casting it as a difference between Marxism and anarchism in general is misleading in light of the strategic varieties of Marxism, some of which embrace it (Choat, 2016). If its argument succeeds, this article shows that prefigurative politics has support not only in anarchist ideas but in Marxist thought as well, which suggests that a fruitful dialogue between anarchist and Marxist ideas is worthwhile. The structure of the article is as follows. It begins (section 2) with an overview of Marx's theory of practice (sometimes written \"praxis\"3) through an analysis of his conception of human powers, needs, and consciousness, and of how they interact in human activity. Next, I link this conception of practice to the idea of prefigurative politics, distinguishing in section 3 three different senses of prefiguration that are potentially relevant for my discussion. I explain my defense of a narrower, strategic conception of prefigurative politics, focusing on specific organizational structures. I go on to argue in section 4 that, on the already-developed theory of practice, prefigurative politics in this narrower sense is crucial for bringing about a free and democratic socialist society. Finally, section 5 defends my position against some prominent criticisms of prefigurative politics. Marx thinks about practice in terms of the development and reciprocal determination of human powers (Kr\u00e4fte) and needs (Bed\u00fcrfnisse). A power here is defined loosely as an ability or capacity, and more precisely, as a person's real possibility to do or to be (Ollman, 1971, ch. 3; Raekstad, 2015, 2016). This is a complex consisting of two things. First, an internal power consisting of whatever internal capacities a person needs for her to do something. Second, a context or set of conditions that enable or preclude the exercise of these internal powers. To have a power is to have both the requisite external context and to have the required internal powers to take advantage of them (see Raekstad, 2015, section 1). Human beings exercise their individual and social powers in order to meet their needs, and in so doing continuously develop and determine their powers and needs in different ways. For instance, if we exercise our powers to practice playing an instrument, our powers to play that instrument will increase; not doing so will result in those powers gradually deteriorating. Since human powers are continually determined through humans' life-activity, and since different societies and historical periods structure this life-activity differently, humans' powers vary across social and historical contexts. Hunger is hunger, but the hunger gratified by cooked meat eaten with a knife and fork is a different hunger from that which bolts down raw meat with the aid of hand, nail and tooth. . . . The object of art\u2014like every other product\u2014creates a public which is sensitive to art and enjoys beauty. (Marx, 1992, p. 92; see also pp. 353\u2013354 and 391) In other words, the ways in which we satisfy our needs by exercising our powers in turn affects those needs, in an ongoing process (Raekstad, 2015).4 Conscious life activity directly distinguishes man from animal life activity. Only because of that is he a species-being. . . . Only because of that is his activity free activity. (Marx, 1992, p. 328) It is true that animals also produce. They build nests and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce only their own immediate needs or those of their young; they produce one-sidedly, while man produces universally; they produce only when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need. (Marx, 1992, p. 329) Consciousness enables human beings to reflect on, deliberate on, direct, and alter that activity as needed. It enables them to produce universally, as opposed to merely the benefits of their own and those close to them, and to produce even when they are free from immediate physical needs\u2014such as the push of simple, instinctual impulses. For Marx, this is associated with two things that are important for thinking about social change. It is part of his explanation for the greater developmental plasticity of human beings as opposed to other animals. Unlike other animals, human beings can consciously set their own standards or yardsticks for their behavior to adhere to, critically reflect on them, and alter them in response to their needs and interests. This, in turn, relates to an explanation for human beings' greater behavioral variation across different natural, social, and historical contexts. Different contexts imply different standards, yardsticks, etc. that need to be met in order to achieve our needs and interests, as well as the nature and contents of those needs and interests themselves. As a result, the standards and yardsticks of human activities will tend to be altered according to their shifting needs and interests (though not necessarily in a uniform or deterministic fashion) by human beings exercising their powers of consciousness. This background is critical for understanding and drawing lessons from Marx's thinking about revolutionary practice. For Marx, as we will see, revolutionary organization requires the development of revolutionary subjects with the right powers, needs, and consciousness. Revolutionary subjects need the powers to really bring about a free and democratic socialist alternative and to organize production and consumption in ways that are free and thoroughly democratic in nature. They must feel a real need to do so. And they need the consciousness that makes it possible for them to introduce and maintain such a society. I will argue that developing these capacities requires prefigurative organization. To make this argument, it is first necessary to clarify what prefigurative politics means in the context of this article. Three main senses of prefiguration need to be distinguished. The first was developed by the early Christian church fathers. The religious origins of the term are sometimes mistakenly confused with the origins of the political idea now referred to as prefigurative politics. In its early Christian sense, prefiguration is a form of \"phenomenal prophecy\"; it is \"something real and historical which announces something else that is also real and historical\" (Auerbach, 1984, p. 29). Although this word later came to be used to denote political organizations aiming to institute in the present some aspects of what they aspire to in a future society, there are crucial differences. First, to prefigure something in this sense is not actually to do it or to try to do it. For Moses to prefigure Christ does not entail that Moses aspires to the same goals as Christ, or that Moses consciously and deliberately works towards what Christ achieves. By contrast, for a revolutionary organization to prefigure the future society it aspires to bring about is for it consciously and deliberately to aim for that future form of society as a goal and to use this aim to structure the way it organizes in the present. Second, whether something is prefigurative in the first sense is determined only retrospectively. We are able to imagine that Moses prefigures Christ only after Christ has come and gone. Since it is impossible to tell beforehand whether something prefigures anything else, and since prefiguration is disconnected from the intentions and goals of the agents doing the prefiguring, prefiguration in this sense does not offer practical guidance to a social and political movement or organization. The contemporary understanding of what today is called prefigurative politics developed in the 19th century without reference to the religious meaning of the term, and only over a century later did the term start to be used to denote this sort of politics (Boggs, 1977; Eckhardt, 2016). (t)he society of the future should be nothing other than the universalization of the organization with which the international will have endowed itself. We must, therefore, have to care to ensure that that organisation comes as close as we may to our ideal. How can we expect an egalitarian and free society to emerge from an authoritarian organisation? Impossible. The international, as the embryo of the human society of the future, is required in the here and now to faithfully mirror our principles of freedom and federation and shun any principle learning towards authority and dictatorship. (Cited in Graham, 2005, pp. 97\u201398) The same idea is today expressed today in the Industrial Workers of the World's famous commitment to \"forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old\" (2014, p. 4) and in the International Workers' Association-Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional de los Trabajadores commitments to, in the words of their British section, \"building a new society within the shell of the old.\" (Solidarity Federation, 2014). There are two main ways in which this commitment to prefigurative politics is interpreted today, each of which is compatible with building a new society within the shell of the old. Thus, the second sense of prefiguration I distinguish here refers to a narrow strategic interpretation, according to which a critical part of revolutionary socialist strategy is to develop organizations that embody structures of deliberation and decision-making that the future society is to contain. There might seem to be a paradox here: if nobody knows what a future society will look like in detail, how can it be prefigured it in contemporary practices? Since prefigurative politics, in this sense, means that the means of the present must be appropriate to some broad sort of vision of a future society, prefigurative politics also implies the \"hypothetical formulation of alternatives and their continuous reformulation through 'trial and error'\"; as such, prefigurative practices must be \"inherently experimental and experiential\" (Sande, 2015, p. 189). This idea is famously captured in the Zapatista slogan: \"Asking, we walk.\" The future society envisioned by these anarchists (Leipold, 2015; Schmidt & van der Walt, 2009) is one without the state or capitalism, in which federations of workers' and local councils govern society from the bottom up according to a mode of participatory democratic planning, eliminating the capitalist division of labor, and distributing goods and services in a wholly different way, usually (but not always) according to need. It is clear that this conception of a future society is broadly identical to that of Marx (Raekstad, 2015, 2016). The commitment to prefigurative politics can be read another way, according to the third sense of prefiguration, as discussed by Carl Boggs, among others, where it refers an organization or movement that itself embodies \"those forms of social relations, decision-making, culture, and human experience that are [its] ultimate goal\" (Boggs, 1977, p. 100). The explicit inclusion of culture and human experience that Boggs talks about is broader than the focus on structures of deliberation and decision-making of the second definition. In addition to breadth, there are two further points of contrast between the second and third senses that need to be mentioned: one historical and one conceptual. In the Wobblies' vision, the structure of their democratic unions prefigured the organizational form that would stitch together all of postcapitalist society. Postwar anarchists developed the metaphor in new directions, however. They urged anarchists to begin creating the new world in all aspects of their daily lives. . . . Earlier anarchists had developed their own cultural worlds. . . . In the postwar period, however, anarchists' prefigurative lifestyles and communities were less and less embedded in broader working-class traditions and neighborhoods, and they were not paired with confrontational class struggle. (Cornell, 2016, p. 208) The shifting emphasis from the structure of revolutionary organizations to modes of life and culture, coupled with moving away from participating in such organizations, indicates one way that a commitment to prefigurative politics along our second and third definitions can conflict. A notion of prefiguration overly focused on counterculture and lifestyle and rejecting large-scale revolutionary organizations would certainly come into conflict with a notion of prefigurative politics focused on how large-scale revolutionary organizations are structured. From the perspective of a revolutionary committed to the necessity of social change through large organizations (such as all the historical anarchist organizations quoted above), the former kind of commitment to prefigurative politics can be read both as a distinct strategic position of its own and as problematically unstrategic in nature (Breines, 1982). Consequently, since my concern here is about a strategic question for organizations and movements, the second definition is the more appropriate one for my purposes. Since this third definition is clearly broader and vaguer than the second and is in my view less fruitful for a discussion of strategy for social movements being pursued here, this article focuses solely on arguments for prefigurative politics in the second sense. Thus, prefigurative politics is defined here as the strategic commitment to developing revolutionary organizations that embody the structures of deliberation and decision-making that a post-capitalist society to contain. This immediately allows us to see that one prominent criticism of prefigurative politics does not apply to the sense defended here; namely, that it amounts to rejecting all strategy or to a strategy of its own (Breines, 1982; Farber, 2014). On the second definition, prefigurative politics involves rejecting some strategies that give no role to prefigurative practices, such as social democracy and Stalinism, but a wide range of others are all in principle compatible with a commitment to prefiguration. For instance, the system of caracoles and good government councils in Chiapas, the network of cantons in Rojava and the networks of recuperated factories in Argentina are all very different and potentially prefigurative in nature. Similarly, some key strategic disagreements in anarchism take place between anarcho-syndicalists and anarchist communists5 over whether the rural communes or syndicalist trade unions are best suited to prefiguring a future society, but their different strategies are all arguably prefigurative in nature. So, too, are rather different experiments with 21st Century Socialism in Venezuela, greatly influenced by M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros's theory of transition, which emphasise developing a network of communal councils and cooperatives to constitute the seeds of emancipatory socialism within the shell of the old polity and economy. The sense of prefigurative politics defended here is a strategic one and it does not amount to a revolutionary strategy all on its own or to rejecting all other strategies. What the strategical interpretation of prefigurative politics says is that the correspondence between vision and praxis is necessary in order to achieve revolutionary objectives. . . . On such an account, the failure of all historical attempts to reach anarchy/communism by way of a vanguard socialist party are not due to the shortcomings of particular individuals (Lenin, Mao, Castro), nor to the adverse \"objective\" circumstances in which such attempts were made and which led them to \"degenerate.\" . . . Rather, . . . these attempts were doomed from the start due to the separation between the revolutionary process and its desired results, a separation which resides in the uncritical reproduction of authoritarian and bureaucratic structures within the revolutionary movement. This is not a matter of practising what one preaches for the sake of it, but because [of] strategical arguments about the appropriate revolutionary path. (Gordon, 2007, p. 61) Such a strategic conception need not place absolute and irrevocable on and may when For instance, many (but not anarchists powers for to a from by internal or for the and their commitment to prefigurative organization (a) such powers to be or the in general social decision-making and (b) organizations that they argue do not such like powers on the of revolutionary trade councils and and embody The section three arguments for this strategic Socialism, for many Marxists and anarchists is all a question of freedom as activity. Since human beings are social animals, this means that the question is one of The capitalist mode of by to a of powers, and by the process and by a of and activity in the and in life more A future society, on Marx's will do away with these powers and enable by society such that it is by federations and workers' and local by means of democratic planning, eliminating the capitalist division of labor, and distributing goods according to need. 2016, This in turn requires the way that work is and Marx's conception had for its strategic the social in terms of which must change to bottom the conditions of their and political and their of the forms and of the had to the of the as a p. must, through both and both come to see as both and and they must a develop to begin to exercise it. p. revolutionary practice needs to (a) the present and (b) the envisioned social change.

      "abstract": "A recent trend in communication studies has seen increased attention to delineating the rhetorical dimensions of publics, public spheres, and public opinions, a project largely inaugurated by Gerard Hauser's (1999)Vernacular Voices. This intervention has shifted the focus from elite discourses of public officials in institutional spaces to everyday acts of discursive engagement in more quotidian and diverse public fora. Meanwhile, theories of \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d have come to be a dominant strand of democratic theory among political scientists and political philosophers. Proponents of the deliberative turn consider deliberation, plurality, and public participation essential to a healthy democratic polity and argue that \u201cconsensus based on reason-giving\u201d should be the goal (Dryzek 2010, 322). As such, and continuing a long line of criticism that runs from Plato to Kant, Rawls, Habermas and others, rhetoric is often treated in deliberative democratic theory as the opposite of rational deliberation and as a tool to be used merely to persuade rather than to prove (Dryzek 2010, 322\u201323).More recently, however, there has been an upsurge of deliberative democratic theory that employs a rhetorical lens or rhetorical concepts and that seeks to emancipate rhetoric from its Platonic and Kantian shackles, such as Bryan Garsten's Saving Persuasion (2009) and Robert Ivie's \u201cRhetorical Deliberation and Democratic Politics in the Here and Now\u201d (2002). Seeing see deliberation as necessarily rhetorical, these theorists shed light on the essentially controversial and agonistic nature of political debate, dialogue, and decision making. They view rhetoric not as merely monodirectional or a form of deceit but instead recognize that rhetoric occurs across multiple public settings and circulates throughout various publics.Continuing to push this dialogue further, Rhetorical Citizenship and Public Deliberation, a collection of essays edited by Christian Kock and Lisa Villadsen, adopts a rhetorical lens to consider public deliberation, political discourse, and democratic society. In a well-crafted introduction, the editors advance the concept of rhetorical citizenship as a unifying perspective for developing a cross-disciplinary \u201cunderstanding of citizenship as a discursive phenomenon.\u201d In this connection, they argue that \u201cdiscourse is not prefatory to real action but in many ways is constitutive of civic engagement\u201d (1). Through eighteen chapters divided into three sections, the contributing authors use rhetorical citizenship as an umbrella term to engage a number of discursive sites, citizen actors, and various publics and public controversies in both theoretical musings and practical, international case studies on deliberative democracy. Overall, the essays marshal \u201ca diversity of actual deliberative practices\u201d in considering \u201chow everyday people participate in and practice citizenship, and how everyday practices might be enhanced\u201d (8).The authors proffer citizenship as a mode of political activity and as a discursive and deliberative process that requires public reflection and entails a rhetorical orientation to the arguments and debates that take place in democratic society. Enacting rhetorical citizenship is thus not merely constituted by \u201cdeliberative exchange among representatives and citizens across multiple sites\u201d (4). It also requires \u201cinternal deliberation\u201d by citizen actors with regard to the public arguments put forth by their political representatives and other public officials. Rhetorical citizenship is a process that requires both citizens' rhetorical output and their discursive, critical engagement with political discourses. To these ends, the individual authors consider \u201cactual civic discourse\u201d that occurs across multiple sites and through a multiplicity of actors at the same time that they interrogate notions of rhetorical agency and issues of \u201cvoice, power, and rights\u201d (7). Further, although proponents of deliberative democracy take consensus and the elimination of conflict as their end goal in public debates and controversies, this collection affords a space for considering the productive and emancipatory nature of conflict, contention, and agon in the public sphere and within public spheres\u2014while also looking ahead to rethink consensus and deliberative norms in general.Throughout the collection, the authors draw heavily on rhetoricians and political philosophers, including Gerard Hauser, Robert Asen, Robert Hariman, Kenneth Burke, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and John Dryzek, among others. While the overall themes of the book are centered on deliberation and rhetoric, scholars from communication studies, discourse analysis, and political philosophy, along with fields outside the humanities such as political science and sociology, all contribute to the dialogue. Developed initially for the 2008 \u201cRhetorical Citizenship and Public Deliberation\u201d conference in Copenhagen, the individual chapters in this collection represent this disciplinary diversity while bringing together academic voices from throughout the international community as well. Each chapter is prefaced by a brief introduction written by the editors, effectively organizing and clarifying the objectives that tie the essays together. As a brief review does not afford space to consider each of the eighteen individual chapters in this collection, my aim here is to reflect on several essays from each section, all of which serve to illuminate the book's broader themes and contributions.The book's first section provides the historical precedents for deliberative democracy, rhetorical citizenship, and the idea of the public forum. Kasper M\u00f8ller Hansen, a political scientist, traces the origins of deliberative democracy through political thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and John Dewey. While contemporary theories of deliberative democracy are often regarded as constituting a new scholarly trend, such dialogues have their roots with these historical political thinkers and with earlier conceptions of the republican tradition. While Hansen provides a historical background for deliberative democratic theory, Manfred Kraus traces the origins of rhetorical citizenship to ancient Greece. Kraus persuasively argues that the Sophists' \u201canalysis of operational truth with respect to the contingencies of human life,\u201d along with their belief in the \u201cconstant negotiation between contradictory points of view as observed in the Athenian practice of political assemblies and law courts, laid the ground for the concept of citizenship\u201d (40). Kraus argues that there was never a Sophist philosophy of rhetoric per se, but when brought together the individuals who identified with sophistry constituted an intellectual movement that presaged Aristotle's later inauguration of rhetorical theory. Finally, tracking and comparing the development and ultimate failure of forums, town halls, and public meetings in France and the United States, William Keith and Paula Cossart tease out some of the fundamental tensions that complicate the ability of citizens to enact their rhetorical citizenship in various discursive contexts. Together, the essays in this section productively set the stage for the remainder of the collection, offering a historical grounding for the main themes of the book as a whole: deliberative democracy and its republican roots; citizenship as a fundamentally rhetorical, discursive, and agonistic practice; and the need to identify alternative discursive sites where citizens can and do participate in political discussions and perform strategies that mitigate the problems and pitfalls of the formal political sphere.Broken up into three parts, the twelve essays in section 2 break some new ground in terms of theory building and for considering non-discursive norms for engaging in political action and public deliberation. Part 1 of section 2 is perhaps best represented by Marie Lund Klujeff's essay and case study on what she calls provocative style. Political debate can be messy. It does not often live up to the ideals or follow the conventions espoused by political theorists and academics. In the political arena, participants may meet discursive challenges that limit or diminish their ability to effectively contribute to debate and thus must adopt unconventional rhetorical strategies that afford an agentive capacity. Klujeff argues that employing a provocative style in public debate can serve as a \u201cdeliberate violation of the norms of official communication and communicative action,\u201d instantiating a \u201cstylistic parody [that] functions as refutation by mockery\u201d (105\u20137). In the internet debate that Klujeff tracks in her case study, the use of such a non-normative stylistic tactic indeed resulted in \u201coffense and irritation.\u201d However, it simultaneously gave \u201crhetorical salience to the conflict\u201d for a much wider audience that would have otherwise not been engaged. It also allowed for the citizen provocateur to participate and contribute to the deliberative process. Similarly, in \u201cVirtual Deliberations\u201d Ildiko Kaposi also looks to an online forum to argue that \u201cthe criteria for judging deliberative talk need to be treated and interpreted flexibly, and modified according to the circumstances in which deliberation and discussion occur\u201d (119). In all, the four essays in part 1 of section 2 argue that breaking the rules of decorum in public deliberations can serve important rhetorical functions. Such non-normative, provocative strategies do not necessarily seek consensus but instead aim to further community building, help circulate political discourse, and foster moral respect between both debaters and broader publics.The four essays in part 2 examine elite discourse in order to \u201cstudy how notions of citizenship are portrayed and realized by agents in positions of power and influence\u201d (63). The authors look across multiple public settings and interrogate political subject matter from the literary public sphere to gendered war rhetoric and from political statements concerning a terrorist attack against the Danish embassy to a case study of constitutional law and political philosophy. Challenging the discursive and deliberative norms of the formal political sphere, the elite citizens (including Barbara Bush and Tony Blair) discussed in part 2 are seen to undertake disruptive discursive acts in the midst of formal political settings. The authors demonstrate that while one is able to exercise one's rhetorical agency through such destabilizing acts, the norms in such institutionalized settings are not so easily challenged or subverted. As Lisa Villadsen writes in her exemplary essay \u201cSpeaking of Terror: Norms of Rhetorical Citizenship in Danish Public Debate Culture,\u201d in such an \u201ca-rhetorical debate culture\u201d as the formal political sphere, the rules of deliberative conduct determine the standards of \u201cproper\u201d rhetorical citizenship (179). Any deviation from these norms is considered a breach of one's citizenship status. Given this, Villadsen calls for the need to \u201ccontinue questioning the norms\u2014spoken or unspoken\u2014that underlie notions of rhetorical citizenship in a given national or cultural setting\u201d (179). Using a rhetorical lens to examine why modes of communicative action may succeed or fail allows for greater opportunities to understand citizenship across multiple settings. Part 3 of section 2 continues the collection's broader goals of examining rhetorical citizenship, deliberative practices, and rhetorical agency across a variety of public contexts. From public hearings held in Quebec, Canada, to grassroots groups in New York and Washington, DC, online debates over Danish real estate economic issues, and public engagement with a song from a popular Danish revue, the four essays extend and add to the diversity of sites in which public deliberation occurs and to what effect.The final section offers a set of future-oriented proposals for how rhetorical citizenship and deliberation can be productive for democratic society in ways that are not agonistic or confrontational. Effectively bookending the collection, the three chapters advance strategies and conceptualizations for reducing contentious debate and transforming competing political arguments in such as way as to encourage a more dynamic and constructive public sphere. As an exemplar, Christian Kock's, \u201cA Tool for Rhetorical Citizenship: Generalizing the Status System\u201d reappropriates and reformulates status theories with the aim of identifying how \u201cpresent-day debaters\u201d and \u201cobservers of debate\u201d may find new grounds for building consensus or mutual understanding between otherwise opposing viewpoints (279). In deliberative contexts where \u201cpartisanship and polarization rule,\u201d Kock provides a tool for fostering \u201cnormative metaconsensus\u201d through narrowing down party-line disagreements to \u201cmore specific points\u2014in which either side might have a better chance of persuading people unsympathetic to their positions\u201d (294). This is not only a tool for debaters and the elite, Kock argues, but also a means of building awareness of the nuances of political disagreements among both citizens who consume these discourses as well as the media that represents them.On the whole, the notion of rhetorical citizenship is a timely intervention that aims to rethink the standards and practices of public deliberation and thereby contribute to a healthier pluralistic democratic polity. Perhaps especially in the context of U.S. politics, where the vitriolic bifurcation of present-day partisan lines leaves little to no room for rhetoric and deliberation in the formal political sphere, such a discussion is not only warranted but necessary, providing a way to think through this antagonistic gridlock. Rhetorical citizenship affords a critical space in which to theorize new practices of public engagement and deliberation and to move beyond deliberative democratic theory's insistence on rigid discursive norms and consensus building. We should attend to and take seriously agon, agitation, destabilization, and other nonnormative dissentious acts in order to better understand alternative sites of democratic instantiation. The nature of conflict, contention, and competition is not always derisive and dividing. Instead, as many of the essays in this collection argue, agonistic enactments can be productive and provocative, building communities, circulating discourse to multiple publics, and affording an agentive modality for civic engagement and citizenship. At other times, as the essays in the concluding section argue, there is an evident need to rethink the meaning of consensus in itself and consider rhetorical strategies for orienting oneself to oppositional positions. Across multiple sites, from online fora, grassroots enclaves, and more formal institutional settings, the international case studies taken up in Rhetorical Citizenship and Public Deliberation speak to the broad applicability of rhetorical citizenship as a concept.This variety in case studies is indeed one of the strengths of the collection, especially when paired with the disciplinary diversity represented by the individual authors. A concept like rhetorical citizenship, as demonstrated by this diverse collection, produces an opening for various other academic traditions to look to the tools and theories cultivated within rhetorical theory and apply them to cases across cultural and political settings. While the concept of rhetorical citizenship in itself requires the reader to extrapolate in order to see how it might be defined across these ostensibly disparate applications, the editors' introductory chapter and prefatory remarks at the start of each section strategically orient the essays to this larger theme. Moreover, as this disciplinary promiscuity speaks to the broad appeal of rhetorical citizenship, Kock and Villadsen do not provide a justification for why these various fields are represented and what this contributes to the overall dialogue. Interdisciplinarity should not be taken as an end in itself, although that is not necessarily to say that is the case with this collection. The diversity of the authors is likely symptomatic of this being a conference proceedings rather than the editors' attempt at diversity for diversity's sake. Given that the topic of the collection is deliberation and democratic society, however, it seems fitting that a range of disciplinary voices would be represented in this dialogue, especially when humanistic disciplines, while sharing much in common, often are insular and speak in their own respective vacuums.Finally, the collection attends to a wide spectrum of public and political sites where deliberation actually takes place. As the editors state in the introduction, \u201cFocusing on how citizens deliberate allows us to consider both macro and micro politics, but always with an eye to the significance for the individuals involved\u201d (6). In this regard, the editors advance a set of research questions that speak to the larger themes of the book, such as \u201cWhat forms of participation does a particular discursive phenomenon encourage\u2014and by whom? How are speaking positions allotted and organized? \u2026 What possibilities are there for \u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens to engage in public discourse?\u201d (6\u20137). Despite the repeated insistence on the collection's commitment to \u201cvernacular rhetoric,\u201d the public settings and political fora addressed in the individual case studies are not quite as representative of a pluralistic democracy as one would hope. The issue of gender is only explicitly taken up in one essay, while questions of how and where racial, ethnic, and LGBTQ minorities are able to perform their rhetorical citizenship are not addressed.The four essays that engage online deliberation are perhaps the closest the volume comes to exploring vernacular discursive contexts, and indeed these critical engagements are valuable. Participation in such online dialogues, on the other hand, still requires an availability that allows for free time to deliberate as well as the economic security that affords ready access to the internet. The editors assert that \u201ca rhetorical focus has a special regard for individual actors in the public arena, not just the eloquent politician or NGO representative but also the person watching an election debate on TV, chiming in with a point of view through a blog on civic issues, collecting signatures from passerby on a windy street to stop municipal budget cuts, or deciding to join a local interest group\u201d (6). And while each of these sites and settings are addressed, the rhetoric and deliberation that is endemic to the streets, down on the corner, in the market, and even in the local pub are left out of this discussion. The reader is left to wonder who we should and should not consider a citizen, what publics the concept of rhetorical citizenship includes and excludes, who has the capacity to enact their rhetorical agency, and more pointedly, whether access to the public arena and the deliberative process necessarily entails a relative position of privilege. As such, while the disciplinary diversity may be one of the strong points of this collection, this openness is contained by a mostly straight, white, male representation of deliberative democratic society.Despite these omissions, however, Christian Kock and Lisa Villadsen's Rhetorical Citizenship and Public Deliberation offers an excellent portfolio of case studies and theoretical insights that will surely contribute to future discussions across a range of disciplinary sites. The bridging of rhetorical studies and deliberative democratic theory is an important intervention that is promising for future cross-disciplinary scholarship and for extending the scope of the discourses and deliberative practices that actually do occur outside more formal political settings. As such, this collection would be well suited for graduate seminars that focus on rhetorical theory, civic engagement, and the public sphere, or as source material for scholarship that aims to expand on discursive theories of citizenship across multiple public and international contexts. It also bodes well for nascent scholarship that aims to bridge the divide between political science and rhetorical studies, a mutually beneficially relationship that offers many opportunities for advancing theories of contemporary democratic society.",

      "abstract": "Abstract&#x0D; In the German tradition of politische Bildung, the Beutelsbach Consensus has been a point of reference since its introduction in 1976. The Consensus consists of three principles. The principle that \u201cMatters which are controversial in scholarship and political affairs should also be presented as controversial in the classroom\u201d is at the center. It is framed by two other principles, the prohibition against overwhelming the student (also referred to as ban on indoctrination) and the principle of giving weight to the personal interests of students (principle of engagement and action). In this article, we discuss the Beutelsbach principles along with criteria for controversiality taken from Anglophone theory of education. These include among others an emotional principle, and a psychological principle. The principles are discussed with two cases \u2013 one from Denmark and one from Germany. In the discussion, we show how these principles are relevant as theoretical tools in the analysis of the cases. It is an important task for the teachers and the school to provide opportunities for the students to engage in deliberation on controversial issues, but it is not a simple task to decide which issues are relevant and controversial, and in what sense. The discussion also shows that the Anglophone discussion of controversial issues and the German tradition of politische Bildung discuss similar issues and could gain from more interaction. As a conclusion, we point to the relevance of the Beutelsbach principles being not only a tool of Didaktik, but also a tool for the student in order to achieve the ideal of a democratic education.&#x0D; Keywords: social science education, politische Bildung, controversial issues, democracy, civic education, Beutelsbach Consensus&#x0D; &#x0D; Beutelsbach-konsensussen \u2013 den tyske tilgang til kontroversielle emner i en international kontekst&#x0D; Sammendrag&#x0D; I den tyske tradition for politische Bildung (politisk dannelse) har Beutelsbach-konsensussen v\u00e6ret et referencepunkt siden dens introduktion i 1976. Konsensussen best\u00e5r af tre principper. Princippet at \u201demner der er omstridte i politik og videnskab skal ogs\u00e5 undervises som omstridte\u201d er i centrum. Det er omringet af to andre principper: forbuddet mod at overrumple eleverne (kendt som forbud mod indoktrinering) og princippet om at l\u00e6gge v\u00e6gt p\u00e5 elevernes interesser (princip for engagement og handling). I denne artikel diskuterer vi Beutelsbach-principperne sammen med prin\u00adcipper for kontroversialitet taget fra den engelsksprogede p\u00e6dagogiske teori. Disse inkluderer et emotionelt princip og et psykologisk princip blandt andre. De forskellige principper diskuteres med to cases, en fra Danmark og en fra Tyskland. I diskussionen viser vi hvordan disse principper er relevante som teoretiske red\u00adskaber i analysen af disse cases. Det er en vigtig opgave for l\u00e6rere og skolen at give eleverne muligheder for at engagere sig i deliberation om kontroversielle emner, men det er ikke nogen enkel opgave at beslutte hvilke emner der er relevante og kontro\u00adversielle, og i hvilken henseende. Diskussionen viser ogs\u00e5 at den engelsksprogede diskussion af kontroversielle emner og den tyske tradition for politisk dannelse diskuterer lignende emner og kunne drage udbytte af mere interaktion. Som en konklusion peger vi p\u00e5 relevansen af Beutelsbach-principperne som et redskab, ikke blot for didaktikken, men ogs\u00e5 for eleverne hvis idealet om en demokratisk (ud)dannelse skal opn\u00e5s.&#x0D; N\u00f8gleord: kontroversielle emner, undervisningsstrategier, religionsundervisning, samfundskundskab, klassev\u00e6relsesobservationer, Beutelsbach-konsensus",

      "abstract": "In the Italian republic of Genoa the members of the city council were selected by random selection from the 12th century on. Over time, the gambling-crazed residents of the city began to bet on who would win a seat and called this a lottery. A few decades later, this developed into the numbers games that have remained popular to this day. From Italy the original Old Germanic word11 Meaning fortune telling and fate in Old Germanic. slowly found its way to the Netherlands and later into the English vocabulary and (as a kind of reimportation with a different meaning) into German as well, to denote all sorts of games based on a random mechanism. It is, however, worth reminding political theorists that the word lottery has a political origin and that the recent comeback of lotteries as a means for democracy fits nicely into this etymology. This complex etymology also reminds us to be open to a broad and many faceted understanding of the role of lotteries in politics. It seems that recently, however, the role of sortition22 In the following I use the terms lottery, sortition, and random mechanism interchangeable. in politics has been narrowed to its instrumental function of selecting members of deliberative opinion polls' respective mini-publics.33 I use the terms deliberative opinion poll and mini-publics interchangeably in this article. As it is well known today, the selection of political offices by lottery\u2014even though they were named kleros in those days\u2014had a traditional place in ancient Greek democracies. In contrast to that tradition, modern democracies rely on elections as the main means of fill political positions. Over the last 20 years we can observe an impressive renaissance of the lottery as a democratic device. Taking inspiration from the early contributions of authors like Robert Dahl, Peter Dienel, and Ned Crosby in the 1970s,44 On these forerunners, see Sintomer (2007); Set\u00e4l\u00e4 and Smith (2018). a growing body of literature today highlights the benevolent impact of randomly selecting citizens for deliberative opinion polls' respective mini-publics55 The deliberative opinion poll is today mostly connected to the work of James Fishkin. See Fishkin (2009, 2018a, 2018b); Brown (2018); Floridia (2018). or even for selecting them for certain political offices.66 See Carson and Martin (1999); Dowlen (2008); Delannoi and Dowlen (2010); Lopez-Rabatel & Sintomer (2018); van Reybrouck (2016); Sintomer (2018). Reform proposals that include lotteries have lost their marginal status, at least in the academic milieu of modern democrats, and have even become a centerpiece of many current political reform proposals. In particular, the format of mini-publics has become attractive to some authors as an alternative to pure electoral democracy; for them mini-publics and other bodies of selected by lot citizens are presented not only as supplements to existent electoral democracy but also as institutions that are supposed to substitute them.77 See Barnett and Carty (2008); Callenbach and Phillips (2008); O'Leary (2006); Reybrouck (2016); Sutherland (2008). Ten years ago I started to propagate lotteries as a means to democratize modern democracies and to transfer the political competence to make binding political decisions to those chosen by lot.88 See Buchstein (2009, 2010). Over the last 10 years has emerged an even more widely shared euphoria among quite a number of political scientists about the use of lotteries to promote democracy. However, such euphoria on the part of so many political scientists has made me suspicious and given reason to a set of concerns and questions: what is the political meaning of the surprising comeback of the lottery in the democratic toolkit today, more than 2,000 years after the fall of ancient democracies? Can one register its comeback in political theory and practice as a potential step forward in the project of democratizing democracy? Are mini-publics meant to be part of a serious attempt to move beyond traditional parliamentary democracy? Is the return of the lottery in this context any more than a desperate and helpless attempt to escape from the political realities at a time of growing social and political polarization in western democracies and of feelings that liberal democracy is in crisis? Is it meant as a response to this crisis or is it ignorant to it? Is the return of the lottery more than nostalgia for Athens's alleged radical demokratia? Or is it just the artificial product of the institutional turn in the academic discourse on deliberative democracy? I will not be able to answer this cascade of critical questions in this article. Instead, I first reflect on the proper role of selected by lot bodies of citizens against the background of recent criticisms of mini-publics, of which the most prominent were put forward by Christina Lafont (section 2). In order to come to terms with her criticism and to dicuss the appropriate use of lotteries in the context of the current wave of literature it may be helpful to revisit some of the basic arguments for decision-making by random mechanisms in modern democracy. Hence, I want to broaden the narrow view on lotteries in the context of mini-publics with a reminder of the five main and more general arguments that have been put forward to defend random mechanisms for decision-making. My list puts particular emphasis on the advantages of lotteries for making efficient and productive decisions and for avoiding corruption (section 3). Pointing out the broad and many faceted potential of lotteries in politics is also a reminder to us to revisit critically the current narrative of the pure democratic meaning of lotteries in ancient democracies (section 4). In the last sections of the article I defend the introduction of lotteries in modern democracies along the line of their potential capacity to produce efficient decisions and to make corruption more difficult (section 5) in two ways: with respect to the internal distribution of political positions in parliaments, using the European Parliament as an example (section 6), and to finding a solution for the dilemma that members of parliament (MPs) face when it comes to making decisions on their own payment and on electoral rules (section 7). Whereas mini-publics were initially used proposed in order to provide a space for discussions among citizens and for them to consult professional politicians, in a significant number of cases of duly elected or appointed authorities have announced in advance that they would follow the decision made by the randomly selected mini-public (B\u00e4chtiger, Dryzek, Mansbridge, & Warren, 2018, p. 16). I also argued strongly for the transfer of the competence to make binding political decisions to mini-publics (Buchstein, 2009, 2010). My considerations were based on the following empirical observation: members of selected by lot deliberative bodies develop a manifest problem of motivation if the relationship between the deliberative project and the final decision-making actually made remains weak, or if no such relationship can be easily recognized by those involved. \"Why,\" Rainer Schmalz-Bruns rightly asked at the early phase of the invention of mini-publics, \"should people contribute the considerable time and effort to a process at all if there is no guarantee that the results will be transformed directly into governance strategies for implementation?\" (Schmalz-Bruns, 1995, p. 268). Accompanying research on participative projects following the model of Fishkin et al. also indicated how important it was for the members of deliberative bodies to consider the relevance of the results to decision-making to those in charge (Font & Blanco, 2007, pp. 579\u2013581; Ryfe, 2002, pp. 366\u2013368). In the light of these empirical findings, 10 years ago I saw that the possibilities of mini-publics boiled down to two options. One could either continue to work with mini-public experiments and projects that lacked any committed or binding decision-making status, thus turning them into some kind of measurement of civic education. Or one chooses to reinforce the political standing of mini-publics and integrate them into existing institutional arrangements with a clearly defined and binding set of competencies. Along this line of argument, strengthening the political position of mini-publics would also provide incentives for citizens to participate in and enter considered deliberations. Andr\u00e9 B\u00e4chtiger et al. correctly state that in discussing the pros and cons of mini-publics \"a great deal will rest on whether or not a mini-public makes binding decisions for the polity\" (B\u00e4chtiger et al., 2018, p. 16). Christina Lafont addresses her recent critique of mini-publics explicitly at the authors who demand a formal status for mini-publics as binding decision-makers (Lafont, 2015, 2017, 2019). As a matter of fact, most advocates of mini-publics do not endorse such demands and mini-publics have so far rarely made binding decisions in political practice.99 See Fishkin (2018a, p. 319); Niemeyer and Jennstal (2018, p. 331); Set\u00e4l\u00e4 and Smith (2018, p. 310). Nevertheless, her critical considerations are an important starting point for locating the proper place for mini-publics in modern democracies. To make her point, she distinguishes between two main strands of the normative arguments shared by the current proponents of mini-publics. Taken seriously, both positions must finally lead to a substitution of electoral democracy in the name of a better, deliberative democracy. The two justifications are based either in the name of full and equal democracy or on the idea of a reasonable democracy. In my brief discussion of Lafont's objections to both of them, I call them the equal democracy position and the responsible democracy position. The equal democracy position starts with the basic presupposition that every citizen has an equal chance of being given a political position.1010 Proponents of this strand are Oliver Dowlen (2008) and recently, David van Reybrouck (2016). One aspect of this presupposition concerns the fair distribution of chances for efficient political participation and is based on three assumptions. The first is the idea that the process of random selection functions like a kind of a search engine for political arguments and talents, as it includes people who would not be able or willing to run for office either because they fear rejection or because they consider their chances are too low (and they cannot blame random selection for this) within the pool of individuals whose political action is solicited. Second, one could argue that phenomena of political alienation and disenchantment with politicians might be diminished by the fact that the process of random selection grants more citizens insights into complex political issues. And third, it may be assumed that the decisions made by people who take office or receive a seat in a political body based on a random selection procedure are strongly binding because they are affected by the problems, life experiences, and value judgments of the participating citizens. The other aspect of the claim to equal democracy lies in the alleged fair representation that lotteries generate. The ideal on which this concept of representation lies has been critically called by Hanna Pitkin \"mirror representation\" (Pitkin, 1967, pp. 71\u201375). This justification of deliberative opinion polls has a serious flaw. After their deliberations the members of the selected by lot group of citizens are no longer simply mirroring the people. At this stage they are supposed to have new and more informed preferences. Hence, instead of truly mirroring the people they have become a kind of beautifying mirror of the citizenry. This change has to do with the connection constructed by theorists of selected by lot mini-publics to the theory of deliberative democracy and to their insistence that it provides a reasonable democracy. The reasonable democracy position1111 The most prominent proponent of this strand are James Fishkin (2009, 2018a) and Yves Sintomer (2018). puts its legitimating emphasis on the considered deliberation of the selected by lot citizens. Proponents of this view see a tension between considered deliberation and mass participation. In this legitimating conflict, they opt for the best quality deliberative procedures and the advantages of considered deliberation in small, face-to-face groups. Some of them even argue that these deliberations should be held behind a veil of secrecy as they fear that the glare of publicity would have harmful effects. The core of the responsible democracy position is an epistemic claim: its advocates argue that through the process of deliberation the participants will change their original preferences into better informed and morally better defendable preferences. Hence, the process of deliberation in mini-publics is understood as a kind of communicative filter system in order to produce a \"laundering of preferences\" (Goodin, 1986, p. 81). Or, put it in the words of one of the philosophical founding fathers of deliberative democracy, J\u00fcrgen Habermas; deliberations have \"an epistemic dimension because they create room for arguments to exert their preference-changing force\" (Habermas, 2018, p. 874). A democracy that works well is understood as a political system that \"as a whole is filtered through deliberation\" (Habermas, 2018, p. 877) and thus contributes to the rationalization of politics.1212 For a critical discussion of this semantic move in the history of democratic theory see J\u00f6rke and Buchstein (2007). With respect to mini-publics, however, certain normative problems arise in making the case for bypassing the general public in the name of their high deliberative qualities. Both Christina Lafont and Marit B\u00f6ker have recently argued that mini-publics diminish rather than increase the legitimacy of democracy. B\u00f6ker insists on the Kantian, Rawlsian, and Habermasian principle that the legitimacy of political authority must \"be based on argumentative justification through public reasoning to those subject to it\" (B\u00f6ker, 2017, p. 23) and reminds her reader that mini-publics are typically used as an instrument of government and thus fail the emancipatory potential of democracy. Whereas B\u00f6ker's critique includes a questionable evaluation of the empirical evidence of the emancipatory effects of mini-publics, Christina Lafont's critique may sound less radical, but really aims at the heart of the responsible democracy position. Mini-publics lack any mechanism of accountability or direct authorization from the wider citizen body. The members of the selected by lot group undergo process of preference change so that their views are no longer representative of the broader public. In case of a conflict between the views of the broader public and the participants of a mini-public Lafont argues against the \"blind deference\" (2015, p. 57) of the former to the latter. Why should citizens blindly defer to decisions made by a randomly picked group of people partaking in a deliberative opinion poll even in such cases in which they strongly disagree with the result? Take, for example, hotly contested policy issues like abortion rights and gun control in the USA, new speed limit regulations for the autobahn in Germany, or Brexit in the UK. In a society characterized by growing political polarization along identity lines it has become more difficult to reach a consensus or a compromise on certain reasonable decisions within mini-publics (Karpowitz & Mendelberg, 2018; Mutz, 2006). Hence authorizing mini-publics to make binding decisions will probably lead to even stronger political estrangement and a growing political climate of suspicion and accusations of conspiracy than what is experienced in the current electoral system. Mini-publics that make unpopular political decisions have the potential to challenge even more thoroughly the perceived legitimacy of the political order than elected bodies. In my view, the growing political polarization in most democracies has made the introduction of mini-publics a less attractive reform option than it may have been 10 years ago. Christina Lafont has pointed out that the justification of authorizing mini-publics to make binding political decisions faces an additional theoretical problem (Lafont, 2019, p. 59). In nearly all cases favoring the introduction of mini-publics the two lines of argument mentioned above intermingle with each other in one way or the other. Most authors claim that they can have it both ways simultaneously: they praise the representativeness of the selected by lot mini-public and they add to it the rational potential of considered deliberation. However, as Lafont has pointed out, the mirror claim and the filter claim do not go together well. On the one hand, a mini-public can be understood metaphorically as a mirror only as long as no considered deliberation has occurred; and the filtered version of the original preferences differs from the original picture in many ways, which is exactly what deliberation among these participants is supposed to bring about. On the other hand, the proceedings of a mini-public can be understood truly as a filter, only in so far as it loses its mirror-like quality. By pointing to these two contradictory claims, Lafont concludes that the political idea of reforming modern democracies via the introduction of mini-publics to make binding decisions faces a logical dilemma that collapses the two approaches in different, one-sided directions. If one follows the responsible democracy claim, the concepts finally merge into an elite conception of democracy that demands \"blind deference to experts\" (Lafont, 2019, p. 56). If one follows the equal democracy claim the proposal has to resist the priority of decisions by more enlightened participants of mini-publics and \"collapses into \u2026 a version of blind deference to the majority\" (Lafont, 2019, p. 62). Christina Lafont's critique of the idea of giving mini-publics the competence to make binding decisions at the centerpiece of a democratic reform agenda is well taken and convincing. In her conclusions she echoes the statement by Andr\u00e9 B\u00e4chtiger et al. that in the discussion about the pros and cons of mini-publics \"a great deal will rest on whether a mini-public makes binding decisions for the polity\" (B\u00e4chtiger et al., 2018, p. 16). Her recommendation is not to abandon the idea of selected by lot bodies of citizens altogether but to remove it from the sector of binding decision-making into a consultative role and into the sphere of participatory civic education, calling this move the politics of \"deliberative activism.\" According to her, the of mini-publics behind the competence is as their only role in a modern democracy is to decision-making by their into the public (Lafont, 2015, p. 56). there seems to be no way to defend the of mini-publics for the of binding political This that Christina Lafont has her critique on all the arguments making the case for mini-publics. However, there are additional and different arguments that she has not taken in her To bring them to a brief reminder of the general arguments for lotteries in politics may the case for mini-publics as well. In her criticism of mini-publics Christina Lafont rightly that their legitimacy on the kind of issues that should be for by (Lafont, 2019, p. that of the have not for this (Lafont, 2019, p. This statement can be more as it other of the lottery as an instrument in modern democracies.

      "abstract": "This paper draws on regulatory governance scholarship to argue that the analytic phenomenon currently known as \u2018Big Data\u2019 can be understood as a mode of \u2018design-based\u2019 regulation. Although Big Data decision-making technologies can take the form of automated decision-making systems, this paper focuses on algorithmic decision-guidance techniques. By highlighting correlations between data items that would not otherwise be observable, these techniques are being used to shape the informational choice context in which individual decision-making occurs, with the aim of channelling attention and decision-making in directions preferred by the \u2018choice architect\u2019. By relying upon the use of \u2018nudge\u2019 \u2013 a particular form of choice architecture that alters people\u2019s behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives, these techniques constitute a \u2018soft\u2019 form of design-based control. But, unlike the static Nudges popularised by Thaler and Sunstein [(2008). Nudge. London: Penguin Books] such as placing the salad in front of the lasagne to encourage healthy eating, Big Data analytic nudges are extremely powerful and potent due to their networked, continuously updated, dynamic and pervasive nature (hence \u2018hypernudge\u2019). I adopt a liberal, rights-based critique of these techniques, contrasting liberal theoretical accounts with selective insights from science and technology studies (STS) and surveillance studies on the other. I argue that concerns about the legitimacy of these techniques are not satisfactorily resolved through reliance on individual notice and consent, touching upon the troubling implications for democracy and human flourishing if Big Data analytic techniques driven by commercial self-interest continue their onward march unchecked by effective and legitimate constraints.",

      "abstract": "In his political interventions, J\u00fcrgen Habermas is a first-class rhetorician. His writing style is eloquent, polemical, rich in aper\u00e7us and metaphors, and often affective, especially angry (see M\u00f6llers, 2021, p. 85). But there are also many metaphors in his contributions to philosophy, social theory, and political theory in which he clearly restrains himself rhetorically. Metaphors appear at crucial points in his theory formation. Formulations like the dialogical give and take of reasons \"in kleiner M\u00fcnze\" (small coins), the discursive \"Verfl\u00fcssigung\" (liquefaction) of traditions, the \"colonization\" of the lifeworld, the \"center and periphery\" of modern democracies, or their institutional \"sluices\"\u2014a metaphor he has adopted from Bernhard Peters\u2014create suggestive images in the minds of his readers. The author, who insists on the strict differentiation between day-to-day language, literary language, and the language of the social sciences (see Habermas, 1990a), and whose philosophical self-understanding insists on the \"unforced force of the better argument\" is a master of evocative metaphors. This attribute alone makes it a pleasure to read his texts. The German edition of his new book does not disappoint those readers in search of metaphors either. In the Marxist tradition (see Marx, 2011), a number of metaphors are borrowed from the sphere of geology: \"segments\" (p. 33)1 of the population, \"erosion\" of democracy (p. 87), normative \"slopes\" (p. 15), the \"crumbling\" of the political system (p. 109), or the \"solidified lava\" of anti-authoritarianism in Silicon Valley (p. 46). Some of the metaphors are nautical like normative \"anchors\" (p. 16), or from the theatre, like the \"grimace\" of libertarian political thought (p. 46). Only a few of them belong to organic life: the \"root ground\" of political culture (p. 32), the \"Gleichurspr\u00fcnglichkeit\" (co-originality) of democracy and the rule of law (p. 90), or the \"nesting\" of normative expectations (p. 14). Most of Habermas' metaphors belong to the vocabulary of the technical world: the \"building\" of modern democracy (p. 9), \"centrifugal\" forms of communication (p. 43), the \"architecture\" of constitutional democracy (p. 32), the \"net of historical memory\" (p. 30), the \"Sollbruchstelle\" (predetermined breaking point) of political rights (p. 92), the \"web of attitudes\" (p. 30), the \"social bond\" (p. 31), civil society as an \"early warning system\" (p. 80)\u2014and again the \"flow chart\" of the political system and its \"filters\" and \"sluices\" (p. 24, 100). One has to wait until the last paragraph of the book to find a military metaphor. Now is the time \"den Spie\u00df umzudrehen\"2 (p. 109) and fight the coalition of conspiracy theorists and right-wing populists. Taking Habermas' preference for technical metaphors into account, it comes as no surprise that he has speaks of \"echo chambers\" (p. 45) and \"fragmentation\" (p. 45) in his critical analysis of the digital public sphere. The spatial metaphor of \u00f6ffentlicher Raum (Raum can literally be translated as unlimited space and as clearly limited room) is combined with the technical vocabulary of systems-theory when he mentions the \"input,\" \"throughput,\" and \"output\" components of the institutional infrastructure of the public sphere (pp. 38\u201339). In one passage of the book, Habermas even addresses the problems of metaphorical writing and states that his metaphor Raum \"must not be overstated\" (p. 60). He may have written this sentence from an unfortunate experience. More than once he has become the victim of his metaphor-rich writing style as critics have claimed that formulations like the \"colonization of the lifeworld\" are too vague to have real analytical power in the field of social research. Another example is the term \"ideal speech situation.\" Habermas originally developed the ideal speech situation 1970 in On the Pragmatics of Social Interaction as an epistemological tool used to test the validity of what is essentially true or actually the case (see Habermas, 2001). In this new book, Habermas once again pushes back vehemently against the \"stubborn misunderstanding\" (p. 69) about this term. First, he points out that he has not used \"this misleading expression\" since his 1972 essay on theories of truth. Second, the catchy formulation was never meant to be a blueprint for political institutions, but as a metaphor for the bundle of pragmatic assumptions that we actually always have to start from when we enter into a discourse about validity claims. Nevertheless, some early advocates of the digital revolution in the first half of the 1990s like Howard Rheingold, Nicolas Negroponte, or WIRED magazine authors like John Katz used Habermas' notions of the ideal speech situation and the unrestricted flow of communication in the public sphere as justification for their dreams of a new virtual democracy.3 According to them, the World Wide Web was the technical incarnation of the ideal speech situation. In their view, the Internet matches all basic requirements of a public sphere that comes as close as possible to the normative core of deliberative democracy: The World Wide Web as the communicative infrastructure for open, unlimited, universal, anti-hierarchical, and complex political interaction. To the radical techno-optimists of those days, the Internet created a new political model, since it offered universal access, freedom of expression, unrestricted agendas, uncoerced communication, and political participation outside of traditional political institutions. Habermas reminds the readers of his new book of the big \"emancipatory promise\" of the \"egalitarian and unregulated\" (p. 45) communicative relationships that were propagated at the beginning of the digital age. And indeed, the positive qualities attributed to political communication in the Internet by Rheingold and other optimists of electronic democracy in the 1990s strikingly resemble Habermas' vocabulary (see Buchstein, 1997, pp. 250\u2013251). In his book The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas defined the public sphere as \"a virtually present network of communication\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) that is freed from any spatiotemporally restricted context. Ten years later, in his outline of the deliberative democratic ideal, he advocated a \"decentred society\" in which \"subjectless forms of communication [\u2026] regulate the flow of deliberations\" (Habermas, 1994, p. 7). According to him, \"technologies of communication [\u2026] make possible a highly differentiated network of public spheres\" (Habermas, 1990b, p. 360), The public sphere should consist of an \"open and inclusive network of overlapping, subcultural politics having fluid temporal, social, and substantial boundaries\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 306). In such a \"discursive structuring of public networks and arenas,\" popular sovereignty \"becomes anonymous\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 171). In his new book, Habermas describes digital technology as a third evolutionary stage in the development of means for communication, following the writing of the spoken word a couple of thousand years ago and the introduction of the mechanical printing press at the beginning of early modernity. Despite the \"revolutionary\" (p. 41) change caused by digital technologies, he insists (again) on the social and political neutrality of new technologies. This position\u2014already taken in the late 1960s by Herbert Marcuse\u2014distinguishes Habermas' argument from two rival positions within the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. On the one hand, it departs from the optimistic positions taken by Walter Benjamin in his famous 1936 essay about the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction or Hans-Magnus Enzensberger's Baukasten zu einer Theorie der Medien (1970). On the other hand, it also distances itself from Theodor W. Adorno's critique of alienated consumer culture and the thesis that the essence of the public sphere has been liquidated in the system of mass media in post-liberal societies. Habermas stated in 1992 that the strong influence of Adorno's theory of mass culture was not difficult to discern in the first edition of Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere 30 years ago (see Habermas, 1992, p. 438). There is an element of coquetry in this retrospective statement because already in the early 1960s he had made the point that the consumerist public sphere in a capitalist society should and could be transformed into a more democratic postbourgeois public sphere. The solution he offered in a less known Encyclopedia article from 1964 was a call for political intervention in order to create \"a rational reorganization of social and political power\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). The public sphere should be brought \"under the mutual control of rival organizations committed to the public sphere in their internal structure as well as in their relations with the state and each other\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). This sounds like an early neo-corporatist expansion of the way public TV was organized in West Germany in those days. Based on his neutralist position, Habermas already in the very beginning of his work about the public sphere more than 60 years ago subscribed to a strategy of state intervention in order to re-regulate the media system. His considerations in The Theory of Communicative Action of 1981 followed the same pattern. Relying on empirical research, he argued\u2014explicitly against Adorno\u2014that even in shifting from writing to images and sounds, electronic media\u2014movie, radio, and TV\u2014have not turned mass media into an apparatus that completely dominates and permeates the language of everyday communication. Instead, he emphasized the \"ambivalence\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) of modern mass media. But the \"unleashing\" of the \"emancipatory potential,\" which is \"built into communicative structures themselves,\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) in the mass media has to be set into action by political measures. Habermas even mentioned Hans Magnus Enzensberger's vision of \"video pluralism\" and \"television democracy\" as attempts to overcome the centralizing media networks in this context. Since then, Habermas has stated repeatedly that modern mass media could both strengthen or undermine the rationality of political communication, depending on the way the infrastructure of the public sphere is regulated (see Habermas, 1992, p. 437). Thirty years after Habermas first published his seminal book about the public sphere stated that there was \"cause for a less pessimistic assessment\" (Habermas, 1992, p. 457) of it and of the future of democracy itself. Another 30 years later, Habermas seems to have returned to pessimism. In his new book, Habermas repeats older statements about the importance of an accommodating, enlightened liberal political culture as the necessary condition for the existence and further development of a democratic political order. His optimism about the further development of western democracies when he published the book Between Facts and Norms in 1992 was still based on his hypothesis about the long-term trend toward a rationalization of the lifeworld. Thanks to the support of post-conventional socialization patterns, families and groups of citizens enter a higher stage of cognitive and moral rationality within their everyday face-to-face communication that also radiates into political communication. As is well known, he adopted the concept of civil society from Andrew Arato and Jean Cohen and turned it into the institutional source for progressive changes of reasons, values, and topics that get transmitted via mass media to the center of the political system. He described civil society as a context of discovery of morally relevant questions arising from the lifeworld. He thus assumed that the lifeworld had a rational advantage in the perception of social problems that were to be transported via social movements and the voluntary associations of civil society into the public sphere. Habermas' overly positive evaluation of social movements and civil society in Between Facts and Norms ignored the fact that a number of voluntary associations already at that time pursued conservative, reactionary, populist, and militant right-wing political goals (see Buchstein, 1994, pp. 107\u2013108). He restricted his considerations about civil society to the question of whether, and to what extent, a public sphere dominated by mass media could provide a realistic chance for the members of civil society to bring about political changes. In Between Facts and Norms, he was relatively optimistic about the possibility of further democratization. In his new book, Habermas is less optimistic. He puts more emphasis on the \"vulnerability\" (p. 30) of the results of socialization patterns and the precarious status of liberal democracies. He states \"political regression\" (p. 41) of liberal democracies around the world seems to have less confidence in the rationalization of the lifeworld. There is a reason for this growing pessimism that has nothing to do with the current Zeitgeist, but follows from a subtle change in Habermas' theory. At first glance, it seems that he is only updating his considerations about the organizational structure of the new media in order to make his argument about the new structural transformation. Both the neutralist position and the state-intervention strategy for a politics of reform and regulation can be found in his book again. Once again, he frames his reflections about the public sphere within his theory of deliberative democracy. He argues that the democratic legitimacy of modern democracies is based on the inclusiveness of the political public sphere. Mass media have an indispensable function, as they ensure the participation of citizens in a common, albeit anonymous, mass communication. Political opinions can only condense into effective public opinions and thus have a targeted influence on political decisions via the publicity of the mass media. Thus, it is imperative that the mass media have an \"enlightening quality\" (p. 23). The centrifugal dissolution of the limits of the simultaneously accelerated political communication to any number of participants at any distance has an \"ambivalent explosive force\" (p. 43). Referring to results of empirical research, Habermas notes that the deliberative quality of political communication in the internet is still an \"open question\" (p. 40). According to Habermas, the \"platform\" (p. 44) character is what is \"actually new about the new media\" (p. 44). In other words, they enable all potential users to participate in the public sphere as independent authors with equal rights. Political communication no longer depends on traditional journalists or any other expert or institution for professional selection and discursive examination. But the services produced by new, privately owned social media platforms are \"in no way neutral services\" (p. 53). They are driven by the capitalist logic of profit-making that also puts pressure on the \"old media\" to adjust to the new format. According to Habermas, the emancipatory potential of the digital public sphere today is \"\u00fcbert\u00f6nt\" (p. 45, in the sense of dominated) by \"fragmented publics\" (p. 45), \"bubbles\" (p. 62), and \"echo chambers\" (p. 45). Both the basic standards for a rational debate and the inclusiveness of the public sphere are threatened to be lost. The stakes are high: the political integration of modern democracies is at risk. It looks like a reminder of the final paragraphs of his first book on the public sphere and to his Encyclopedia article from the 1960s, when Habermas presents a strategy that includes three proposals to overcome this (newly) alarming decline of the public sphere. The first strategy counts on civic education: Citizens have to learn how to deal with this new technology in a reasonable way; and this may take some time (cf., pp. 46\u201347). The second strategy consists of strong state regulation of the mass media, for example, to force private owners of platforms in an effective way to correct false information or to prevent hate speech. Finally, the third reform strategy is to provide alternatives to the media power of privately owned companies. He proposes an expansion of financial support for state-funded and democratically controlled TV and radio stations (cf., p. 51 and 67), and even for (printed and digital) newspapers that fulfill certain quality standards (cf., p. 67).4 This reform agenda is conservative in that it attempts to carry the media organization of the 1970s into our digital age. In his 1962 book, he glorified the bourgeois public sphere. In his new book, he is again glorifying a media system of the past. I have listed his threefold political reform agenda because it provokes a non-trivial question: How is it possible to regulate the structures of political communication in a way that strengthens enlightened discussions via legislative measures, when such regulations (at least in democracies) have to be the result of (less enlightened) political communication? In the context of this question, it is striking that face-to-face communication gains more relevance in Habermas' theory than before. It is a subtle change. But it has the potential to produce more than just subtle changes to Habermas' final evaluation of the prospects for political reform of the public sphere. In his characterization of elected parliaments Habermas notes that their members \"deliberate and decide together [emphasis in original] according to democratic procedures\" (p. 24). I will not discuss the problematic theory of parliamentarism in the context of this article, but I do want to point to his formulation \"deliberate together [emphasis in original].\" In my understanding, this formulation indicates a normative preference for political communication in social face-to-face constellations, which is typical for interaction in the lifeworld. In a different section of the book, Habermas explicitly praises the deliberative quality of parliamentary decision-making because decisions are made \"face-to-face after democratic deliberations [emphasis in original]\" (p. 102). He also attests to the courts \"comparatively high level of rationality\" (p. 78), which seems not only to be the result of its legal institutionalization but also due to the fact that court hearings and deliberations are held face-to-face. Finally, in his characterization of social movements and a vibrant civil society he emphasizes their \"face-to-face encounters\" (p. 39) in everyday life and public events. In one of the most intriguing sections of the book, Habermas speculates about a changing perception by the users of social media in which the separation between public and private communication is abolished. According to him, a significant part of digital communication today should be understood neither as public nor as private. Rather it is a sphere of communication, which has been reserved until then for private correspondences by letter, that has been bloated to a public existence. It produces a \"peculiar anonymous intimacy\" (p. 62) which Habermas coins a \"Halb\u00f6ffentlichkeit\" (p. 65\u2014semi-public sphere) of echo chambers and filter bubbles.5 However, this speculation puts Habermas in a dilemma. The lifeworld in Habermas' theory is conceptualized as a linguistically organized and culturally transmitted stock of interpretative patterns which form the symbolic core of a society. He introduces the lifeworld as a necessary correlation to the notion of communicative action (see Baynes, 2016, pp. 64\u201370). The dilemma is the following one: On the one hand, Habermas continues to base the considerations in the book on the assumption of the rational potential of the lifeworld, in particular of face-to-face communication even in different social settings. On the other hand, his speculation provides the plausible assumption that under the conditions of the current digital communication infrastructure, there will be a massive unlearning of cognitive and moral In his 1962 book, Habermas that with the of mass media, the of the capitalist and the of the (Habermas, p.

      "abstract": "This article offers an exploration of the socialist principle \u201cFrom each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.\u201d The Abilities/Needs Principle is arguably the ethical heart of socialism but, surprisingly, has received almost no attention from political philosophers.1 I will propose an interpretation of the principle and argue that it involves appealing ideas of solidarity, fair reciprocity, recognition of individual differences, and meaningful work. There is a moderate revival of interest in socialism. In the aftermath of the global crisis of 2008, many people started to wonder whether there is a desirable alternative to the capitalist way of organizing economic life. Socialism provides the historically most important counter-tradition to capitalism. But how should we understand socialism today? To answer this question, we can think of a fully developed conception of social justice as having three key dimensions. It would propose a set of normative principles (DI), certain social institutions and practices that implement those principles (DII), and some political strategies of transformation leading agents from where they are to the social realizations implementing the principles (if these do not exist already; DIII). Now, it is common to characterize socialism (or communism, a term preferred by many Marxists) in terms of dimension DII. Socialism is seen as a form of social organization in which economic class division no longer exists and in which workers control the means of production, shape the economic process, and benefit equally from it. I think, however, that this narrow focus on DII should be avoided, and that we should make discussion of DI more prominent. We cannot defend any specific version of DII as desirable without engaging the standards that DI illuminates.2 Discussion at DI is also crucial because we cannot simply assume, as many socialists did in the past, that socialist transformations are inevitable. History need not move in a socialist direction. To move it in that direction, some political agents will have to become committed to socialism and pursue it in practice. Given the mistakes of past socialist politics, this point has real bite. Many people need to be convinced that socialism is desirable, and some also need to be convinced that socialism is not utterly undesirable. This requires ethical argument and advocacy. This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 analyzes the formulation of the Abilities/Needs Principle by Marx. Section 3 identifies the principle's initial plausibility, but shows that it faces problems that cannot be addressed without developing a fresh interpretation of it. Sections 4.1\u20134.3-4.1\u20134.3 provide an interpretation of the principle that highlights demands concerning opportunities for self-realization in work, positive duties of solidarity, sensitivity to individual differences, and mechanisms of fair reciprocity. Although it focuses largely on DI, this article also considers DII and DIII. Section 4.4 explores a practical implementation of the socialist principle, and Section 5 discusses some normative puzzles about the transition from capitalism to socialism. The Abilities/Needs Principle (hereafter \u201cANP\u201d) was formulated by Karl Marx in a late text, the \u201cCritique of the Gotha Program.\u201d This is one of the few occasions in which Marx is explicit about what socialism (or communism, in his words) would involve. Although my aims in this article are not exegetical, it will be helpful to summarize the key points in Marx's discussion.3 They are of intrinsic interest, have been quite influential in socialist thought, and will be significant for this article's argument. Marx presents two principles of distribution. The first is the so-called Contribution Principle (To each according to their contribution), and the second is the ANP (From each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs). They are supposed to apply consecutively, in two phases of socialism. The second is evaluatively superior to the former. In the early phase part of the distribution already caters directly for needs: the Contribution Principle is constrained by basic provisions concerning health care, education, and the reproduction of the infrastructure of the economy. But the ANP goes far beyond such basic needs, catering for the conditions for everyone's human flourishing. The ANP also interrupts the translation of inequalities in natural endowments into unequal access to consumption goods. The needs of each person count equally regardless of the extent of their capability to produce. However, the principle's implementation is not feasible during the early stage of transition, as moral and political culture is still colored by bourgeois principles (such as the principle of exchange of commodities with equivalent value\u2014which disadvantages workers with lower natural talents), and there is not yet enough material abundance to support the higher needs of all. It thus makes sense to implement the Contribution Principle first. Although less intrinsically desirable, its implementation would ease the transition away from capitalism by delivering on its unfulfilled promise to reward productive output rather than reflect the superior bargaining power of those in superior class positions. Furthermore, it would pave the way for the creation of more desirable distributive schemes by introducing incentives to generate the level of material abundance that would make distribution according to needs viable and, thus, a real option. Some might ask whether it makes sense today to even entertain a view of economic justice based on the ANP. Kymlicka provides an instructive example of skepticism.9 He raises a number of challenges to the ANP. They can be summarized as saying that the principle may be trivial, redundant, or manifestly inferior to others. Triviality may arise if it just restates the familiar idea of equal concern for the interests of all without telling us anything specific about how to honor it. It may be redundant because we already have principles calling for equal consideration of the interests of all in liberal egalitarian theories (such as those of John Rawls or Ronald Dworkin). When we consider those theories we may find, furthermore, that the ANP is manifestly inferior to them, as it does not include insights they lack and it lacks insights they have. Two examples of the latter insights are the account of the needs or interests that matter from the point of view of justice by reference to social primary goods (Rawls) or resources (Dworkin), and the circumstance/choice distinction that helps to establish a demarcation between inequalities that deserve to be combated from the point of view of justice (those resulting from circumstances) and those that do not (those resulting from choice). To respond to this challenge we can say several things. First, the ANP was formulated before the recent liberal egalitarian theories that Kymlicka mentions, and Marx already captured some of the insights of those theories in his discussion of the ANP. Marx and socialists more generally, were worried about superficial views of equality that did not address material disadvantage. They demanded economic systems that actually worked equally to the benefit of all those living under them, challenging the absolute and relative deprivations capitalist institutions generated. In this respect, part of the appeal of contemporary liberal egalitarianism consists precisely in mobilizing socialist concerns that pre-date it. Furthermore, Marx anticipated the circumstance/choice distinction. As we saw, in the \u201cCritique of the Gotha Program\u201d Marx criticizes the Contribution Principle precisely because it condones inequalities in the capacity to satisfy needs which result from choice-independent differences in natural endowments. Arguably, the ANP captures the liberal egalitarian concern for responsibility if we consider both of its clauses rather than only the second (as Kymlicka does). The first clause identifies a responsibility to contribute, and we can interpret the second (as I will below) as taking the justifiability of some demands on the social product as depending on one's making an appropriate effort to support its generation. There is more. The ANP and the socialist tradition provide fresh insights about how to think about the metric and duties of distributive justice. They include a rich account of \u201cabilities\u201d and \u201cneeds\u201d as being multifarious, developing over time, and as partially dependent on the nature of social and political systems. They include a valuable emphasis on the significance of self-realization in work besides consumption.10 And they display a fundamental concern for solidarity (as captured, for example, in the responsibility to produce to meet the needs of others as something that has intrinsic significance). Recent liberal egalitarian theories are different from earlier liberal views of economic equality (which focused only on formal equality of opportunity) precisely because they have absorbed the historical contribution of socialism. It is liberalism that has moved toward socialist ideas. If contemporary socialists move toward the liberal egalitarian framework, they partly move toward greater understanding of their own historical contribution. As will become clear from what follows, I accept that there are serious problems in the Marxian formulation of the ANP. I also accept that contemporary socialists have much to learn from liberalism. I think that any viable contemporary socialist view of justice must substantially overlap with liberalism, absorbing the priority the latter gives to certain civil and political freedoms. But the socialist tradition has much to offer as well. An elaboration of the ANP can yield important insights. I focus here on the ANP. But a complete account of dimension DI of socialism should also include other principles, and if possible identify their relations. For example, it should include principles of civil and political liberty, and see them as often outweighing the ANP when their implications conflict. If people choose jobs in which they make poor use of their productive abilities they should not be coerced to do other work (except in emergencies15). People should obey (although they may campaign for changing) distributive arrangements generated by a legitimate democratic process even if they are unjust according to the ANP (unless the injustices are extreme). In the interpretation I will formulate, the principle is normally constrained by some civil and political liberties. We can account for people's needs by considering what would constitute their capabilities to engage in certain valuable \u201cfunctionings\u201d (i.e., certain ways of being or doing they have reason to value). Marx's view of socialism as securing the conditions for people's self-realization, itself construed as the development and exercise of various capabilities, can indeed be seen as a case of the capabilitarian strategy. In particular, the emphasis on autonomous and cooperative capability development and exercise at the workplace is a distinctive contribution of the socialist tradition to the capability metric.19 There are two kinds of work in Marx's view: work that merely secures subsistence and work that involves the extensive development and expression of workers' various capabilities. The second is the kind of work that includes self-realization. It involves activities in which workers cooperate with each other as equals, have powers to choose what to do and how to do it, and develop and exercise skills through interesting, challenging, and enjoyable performances. It is the opposite of alienated labor, which involves dull or distressful tasks and servile or hostile relationships.20 Now, these two kinds of work are respectively picked out in two common interpretations of the significance of work in Marx's view of socialism, the \u201chigher form of society \u2026 in which the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle.\u201d21 One interpretation draws on Marx's contrast between the \u201crealm of freedom\u201d and the \u201crealm of necessity,\u201d which seems to locate all work in the latter, and envisions self-realization as occurring outside of it.22 The other invokes Marx's characterization of work as \u201clife's prime want.\u201d23 Here self-realization in work is a primary achievement of socialism. Arguably both forms of work are important, although in different ways. Access to work involving self-realization should count as one of the needs satisfied in socialism. As described in the previous paragraph, it strikes me as an intrinsically significant good. If the design of a just society is to focus not only on distributing the outputs of an economic process but also on its internal shape, it should have room for work of this kind. Conversely, a duty to do one's fair share regarding some forms of instrumentally necessary but not intrinsically desirable work is obviously part of what a duty to contribute according to one's abilities should include. Of course, there are needs that go beyond work. Needs regarding consumption goods and the pursuit of intimate relationships are clear examples. When it comes to those Marx's framework is often limited, and we must look elsewhere.24 Recent work in the capability approach provides excellent ideas concerning what further categories of needs and associated capabilities we should The capability approach various of It that we people's positive to develop and exercise various it for people's by not them to engage in any specific it gives to political (such as that people to and political of important capabilities and distributive schemes I to the and of this In a people can develop and their own views of what needs should be But we should not democratic of and about what needs deserve to be for example, considers the of a of of needs that we should that are are are He three by a a that without and social agents to He that the is the But that his discussion moved from to Some might say that we should a view here and think that how distributive schemes are provides the conditions that make them I this because it is to a version of the a distributive because we make it, or should we make it because it is of the or of principles do not provide as we to think about what to and to in a about needs if we it.

      "abstract": "Notions such as wellbeing, freedom, and social justice are integral to evaluating social progress and developing policies. One increasingly influential way to think about these concepts is the capability approach, a theoretical framework which was pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s. In this book Ingrid Robeyns orientates readers new to the capability approach through offering an explanation of this framework. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice also endeavors to resolve historical disputes in the literature and thus will be equally engaging to those familiar with the field. The author offers a novel and illuminating account of how the capability approach can be understood in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of application. Special attention is paid to clarifying misunderstandings that have been caused by different disciplinary assumptions and the interpretive consequences they have for our consideration of the capability approach. Robeyns argues that respecting the distinction between the general capability approach, and more specific capability theories or applications, helps to clear up confusion and misinterpretation. In addition, the author presents detailed analyses of well-known objections to the capability approach, and also discusses how it relates to other schools of analysis such as theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice offers an original and comprehensive account of the field. The book will appeal to scholars of the capability approach as well as new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduction.",

      "abstract": "This chapter provides concluding reflections and next steps in a research program bridging curriculum theory/Didaktik and educational leadership studies. The bridging utilizes non-affirmative education theory as the theoretical ground. To begin, we present a retrospective discussion of the project. We then relate the approach to the contributions included in this volume, especially focusing on the normativity of education theories, and pointing at how non-affirmative education theory corresponds to deliberation oriented democratic-hermeneutic initiatives. Non-affirmative education theory identifies both leadership, teaching and curriculum work as critical deliberation based professional activities driven by subjects, individual agency in historically developed cultural and societal institutions framed by policies. Non-affirmative educational leadership practices are expected to take a critical stand regarding given policies, and other expectations, yet mindful of that education in democratic societies, typically following a Bildung tradition aim at individuals making up of their own minds and learning that practices, also moral and political ones, may and can be changed. The approach applied in this volume, i.e. to point at the roots of modern European education theory not only helps us to better see connections between this Bildung tradition, Deweyan pragmatism and deliberative democracy but is also used as a point of departure to continue towards comparative research on how educational leadership work is carried out in the intersection between curriculum as a policy document and leadership practices at different levels as discursive practices.",

Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) is a participatory research approach that draws upon design tools and ways of thinking in order to bring healthcare staff and patients together to improve the quality of care. The co-design process that is integral to EBCD is powerful but also challenging, as it requires both staff and patients to renegotiate their roles and expectations as part of a reconfiguration of the relationships of power between citizens and public services. In this paper, we reflect upon the implementation and adaptation of EBCD in a variety of projects and on the challenges of co-design work within healthcare settings. Our discussion aims to contribute to the growing field of service design and to encourage further research into how co-design processes shape \u2013 and are shaped by \u2013 the power relations that characterize contemporary public services.",

Since 2008, elite news and opinion outlets like the New York Times have placed Black advocacy journalists in positions where they can allocate resources, shape editorial decisions, and \u2013 in the tradition of the historical Black press \u2013 challenge long-standing narratives of the nation's racial history. Using concepts first developed by Black and feminist critics of Habermas's theory of democratic deliberation, this article contends this new Black press has shed its status as a \"counterpublic\" and is fighting to build a new consensus on racial justice from within the mainstream public sphere. The article contextualizes this effort by examining two critical junctures in the nation's history when the white, mainstream press helped reify racial narratives the new Black press is now struggling to dismantle. It also explores the backlash against the new Black press, and it raises questions about the functionality of the current networked public sphere.KEYWORDS: Public sphereBlack pressrace and democracyjournalism historydemocratic theorycivil rights Disclosure StatementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

      "abstract": "In these recent years the idea of deliberative democracy appears as an alternative idea in the middle of discourse of democracy\u2019s contest and configuration. Through its critics which are submitted into two dominant democratic traditions (also seeking to synthesize them), viz republicanism and liberal democracy, deliberative democracy makes serious efforts to pass theoretical tensions of those two democratic traditions over by formulating a communicative participation theory in an autonomous public sphere which whom is inclusive (multi-actors), free from pressures, discrimination and manipulation.Yet, the idea of deliberative democracy self if it is observed from many deliberation literatures and practices which are studied and implemented in many countries, it has at least two variants that are mutually exclusive. First, variant of impartialism which emphasize on normative principles including the attitude and action to be inclusive, autonomous (non-partisan) and holding on the argumentation which whom considers multi-perspectives and multi-actors in taking a decision or public policy. Inter-subjectivity of an opinion was emphasized very much relating to goodness and rightness of a decision. Second, the impartialism\u2019s critics that realizes to the real of politics and criticizes the model of impartiality that is regarded as too utopian and idealistic in applying deliberation. Principles of reciprocity, continuity, inclusivity and heterogeneity of deliberation are taken as substitute of inter-subjectivity principle in impartiality model.This paper makes a try to investigate the origin of deliberative democracy idea in modern democratic tradition. Furthermore it analyzes development of two variants of deliberative democracy idea. Finally, it endeavors to contextualize the history of Indonesian idea of democracy especially in the idea of consensus discussion (musyawarah mufakat) which is the heart of Indonesian democracy. Of course this paper uses more historical approach to explore them all.",

      "abstract": "It has been argued that the Internet and social media increase the number of available viewpoints, perspectives, ideas and opinions available, leading to a very diverse pool of information. However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called \"filter bubbles\". This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.",

We start with a definition of PCSR, focusing on firms\u2019 contribution to public goods. We then discuss historical antecedents to the debate and outline the original economic and political context. The following section explores emerging changes in the institutional context relevant to PCSR and reconsiders some of the assumptions underlying Habermas\u2019 thesis of the postnational constellation. This highlights some neglected issues in previous works on PCSR, including the influence of nationalism and fundamentalism, the role of various types of business organisations, the return of government regulation, the complexity of institutional contexts, the efficiency of private governance, the financialization and digitalization of the economy, and the relevance of managerial sensemaking. Finally, we discuss the contributions to this special issue and relate them to the newly emerging research agenda.",

This approach neglects an important phase oriented not so much to decision-making but to social learning and understanding. Combining deliberative theory with research from social psychology, Bora Kanra has developed an innovative critique and synthesis by allocating social learning its own formal sphere. For deliberative democracy to produce better outcomes, decision-making needs to be reinforced by opportunities for social learning. Stressing the importance of the development of democratic dialogue in divided societies, Kanra tests his claims of a new deliberative framework by analyzing interaction between Islamic and secular discourses in the Turkish public sphere. This in-depth analysis of converging and diverging political beliefs and traditions between seculars and Islamists emphasizes the importance of social learning in a sharply divided society. A groundbreaking and illuminating insight into the prospects for democratic development in Turkey, Islam, Democracy and Dialogue in Turkey reveals an emerging dynamic in Turkish politics representing a new opening in political practice.",

      "abstract": "Participatory democratic practices are often seen as caught between two ideals: inclusiveness and efficiency. On the one hand, they are meant to provide \"democratic deepening\" by using inclusive processes and giving everyone a voice; on the other hand, they are expected to deliver good results (Gilman, 2012). But can one have both at once? Can deliberation be more than an \"endless meeting\" (Polletta, 2004)? And can the positive epistemic potentials of deliberation (Landemore, 2013, chap. 4) and other forms of political participation be unlocked in practice? In this paper, we discuss a case study that provides reason for cautious optimism: practices of deliberative1 decision-making and task distribution in a 2019 \"climate camp\" in Germany. Here, radical ideals of democratic inclusion and horizontality2 came up against practical imperatives of efficiency with regard to the day-to-day organization of the camp. We analyze in detail how the participants in this camp dealt with two kinds of tension: the tension between the use of differential knowledge and the risk of thereby creating hierarchies; and the tension between participatory practices and imperatives of efficiency, which, as noted at the outset, has often been seen as a challenge for deliberative participatory practices. We argue that through a number of strategies, the participants of the camp managed to overcome these tensions, with the strategies for overcoming the former tension also helping to overcome the second one. We also discuss what this\u2014admittedly very specific\u2014setting can tell us about deliberative practices more generally speaking. Our paper is situated at the intersection of two sets of literature. First, we draw on ideas from deliberative democratic theory (Cohen, 1989; Gutman & Thomson, 2004; Parkinson & Mansbridge, 2012; Young, 2001) and the literature on the epistemic advantages of democratic practices (Anderson, 2006; Landemore, 2013). Many deliberative democrats have pointed out that social movements can be arenas of democratic deliberation (e.g., Dryzek, 2000; Fraser, 1990). Here, our contribution is to discuss a real-life example, based on ethnographic work,3 of how the epistemic potentials of democratic deliberation can be unlocked, turning it into a positive factor for efficient problem-solving. But we also make explicit that this requires a specific attitude and set of practices that are usually not included in the abstract ideal of deliberation. Second, our case study also speaks to the literature on participatory democracy (Menser, 2018) and social movement studies (e.g., Della Porta, 2009; Felicetti, 2016; Leach, 2016; Maeckelbergh, 2009; Mansbridge, 1983; Polletta, 2004; Sitrin, 2012). Here, our original contribution follows from focusing on the epistemic tensions of democratic participation. While most of the available research focuses on the problems concerning the effective realization of democratic ideals and reaching consensus, we focus on successful strategies and mechanisms by which the participants deal with knowledge under radically democratic conditions.4 In the next section (Section 2), we describe our case study and the ideals of horizontality and inclusion it tried to realize in more detail. We then turn to its epistemic practices, identifying some of the mechanisms and strategies through which the inegalitarian effects of epistemic hierarchies, such as unequal knowledge, are avoided (Section 3.1). This is followed by a discussion of how the second tension, between inclusion and efficiency, was overcome (Section 3.2). We also critically discuss whether the lessons learned from this case can be generalized (Section 4). In the conclusion (Section 5), we summarize our results: our case study shows that epistemic practices which successfully combine strong democratic ideals of horizontality and efficiency are possible. To this extent, we can describe the epistemic practices of this climate camp as \"real epistemic utopias.\" We draw on ethnographic observations during a 7-day stay at a climate camp5 and participation in its activities, as well as 11 semi-structured interviews with participants, which lasted between 30 and 90 min.6 The climate camp understands itself, according to the self-description on its website, as a \"self-organized, grassroots democratic camp trying to achieve the least possible hierarchies.\"7 Its aims were to fight for climate justice by trying out alternative forms of living, creating networks, educating oneself, and developing actions against climate change.8 There was a strong imperative to \"get things done,\" not least because of the practical necessities that come with setting up and running a camp for several hundred people. This makes this camp an especially interesting site of analysis: the charge that actors in social movements are occupied with \"nothing but talking\" is not plausible given these very hands-on tasks, such as building infrastructure and providing food, which had to take place in addition to workshops and other activities.9 We analyze how the participants of this camp attempted to put ideals of democracy and inclusion into practice, while at the same time facing the challenges of integrating unequal knowledge and expertise into their decision-making and cooperation. The democratic ideals of horizontality and inclusion that permeated the camp's democratic culture are specific to a tradition of mobilizations that goes back to anarchism (Maeckelberg, 2009, p. 70) and which has greatly influenced social movements since the 1960s, including alter-globalization movements (Maeckelberg, 2009, p. 15) and anti-austerity movements like Occupy Wall Street (Graeber, 2013). Many of these movements aim at prefiguring political alternatives by enacting practices of democracy that \"do not necessarily match hegemonic definitions of actually existing systems or even normative liberal ideals\" (Paley, 2002, p. 485, quoted in Maeckelberg, 2009, p. 32). The movements' ideals of horizontality and inclusion reflect their struggles for more radical forms of democratic decision-making and of being together. They are understood as regulative ideals that need to be actively created and searched for, given that existing governance structures and people's ensuing habits do not prepare them for more democratic forms of life. Marianne Maeckelberg, who has provided one of the most complete analyses of democratic practices in social movements focusing on the alter-globalization movement, describes horizontality as a \"term used by movement actors to refer to less hierarchical networked relationships of decision-making and organizing structures that actively attempt to limit power inequalities\" (Maeckelbergh, 2009, p. 69). It is a \"prefiguration of an egalitarian democratic praxis\" (Maeckelbergh, 2009, p. 69). This does not mean, however, that all forms of enacting horizontality are equal: \"Movement approaches to horizontality are fluid and diverse, but all notions of horizontality share in common the aim of limiting hierarchical power relations\" (Maeckelberg, 2009, p. 108). We can further specify Mackelberg's definition by characterizing horizontality as the active and continuous creation of situations of cooperation that entail two main elements: reducing the power of some participants to give orders to others to a minimum (hierarchy reduction) and promoting consensus at different levels of decision-making. While hierarchy reduction aims at making us equal cooperators, consensus decision-making aims at making us equal decision-makers.10 Regarding inclusion, the camp was committed to the democratic idea that nobody should be or feel excluded from the deliberations, decision-processes, and the activities of the camp. For this reason, promoting inclusion did not only mean formally guaranteeing that anyone can participate in the camp, but also being aware of and counteract more subtle forms of exclusion that go hand in hand with language, national identity, aesthetics, gender identity, and class. In our case study, the realization of these ideals did not come without practical difficulties that had to be confronted. For example, since orders were seldom given, participants sometimes found it difficult to know what they had to do in the camp's division of labor. Sometimes they found it hard to understand the implicit rules of participation and communication of the camp. This was particularly acute for those who were not familiar with the participatory culture of the camp. According to the testimony of the interviewees, consensus decision making was usually fluent but sometimes generated frictions among participants that, in the worst case, led to the blocking of decision through the exercise of someone's veto right (this, however, according to one experienced activist, had happened just once in the previous year's camp and once within the first 7 days of the current camp). Is it possible to say that these ideals were successfully realized in the camp? In our study we did not develop any quantitative criteria to measure the extent to which the practices in the camp realized democratic ideals of horizontality and inclusion. In this sense, our conclusions need to be taken with caution. However, the participants' own testimonies draw a positive picture. In most cases, we found that participants explicitly believed that the camp was horizontal and inclusive, and, in most cases, they could appeal to their own experience to show this. More concretely, we identified two groups among interviewees: those who participated for the first time in a camp and who were not familiar with the camp's democratic culture, and those who had already some experience in similar camps or movements and could compare it to previous experiences. For the first group we found that all interviewees expressed a sense of positive surprise: even if they found it difficult, at the beginning, to adapt to the democratic culture of the camp, they quickly generated habits of horizontal cooperation, such as communicating without commanding. For the second group of participants, we found that they expressed satisfaction with regard to the democratic quality of the camp, given their previous experiences, and that they could not remember any really bad experience. Of course, this does not mean that some participants did not sometimes experience problems. For example, our interviewee Toni, who oversaw communication technology in the camp, described one situation in which an (older) man was telling her what she had to do without even asking if they had already tried what he proposed. However, our interviewees pointed to a general willingness among participants and success in creating horizontality and inclusion despite existing difficulties and were aware of the democratic means available to confront these issues.11 The epistemic practices that we describe in the next section were key in order to uphold horizontality and inclusion even in the face of certain challenges. Our focus was on the epistemic practices that took place in the camp: processes of knowledge production, of sharing information and passing on knowledge to others, of organizing tasks that required certain forms of knowledge, or of introducing newcomers to both the practical and the political dimensions of the camp, for example, the tasks of the different self-organized working groups, or the use of gender-just language.12 We also include processes of deliberative decision-making to the extent that participants often introduced consensus-based deliberation procedures in order to identify, define, and search for solutions to the problems of the camp. This also includes plenary deliberations about what the camp is: is it a protest, a demonstration, or a private event? The idea that social movements are \"spaces and processes in which knowledges are generated, modified, and mobilized by diverse actors\" (Casas-Cort\u00e9s & Osterweil, 2008, p. 20) has been recently explored in the sociological literature, bringing a \"new inspiration for sociology\" that puts into question the usual division of cognitive work between sociologists and social actors (Cox, 2014, see similarly Arribas Lonzano, 2018). Certainly, the ways in which social movements realize political ideals of horizontality and inclusion go far beyond the sphere of their epistemic activity.13 However, focusing on epistemic practices is justified by the fact that here the challenges of combining ideals of horizontality and inclusion with efficiency are particularly pronounced. Our notion of \"epistemic practice\" aims at providing an analytical tool for the analysis of this essential dimension of mobilization, with a focus on patterns of behavior and strategies of coordination. Our view on these epistemic practices takes inspiration from Dewey's account of experimental inquiry, which focuses on the articulation of shared experiences and the promotion of learning processes (Dewey, 1938, chap. 6; see also Seigfried, 1996). For Dewey, experimental inquiry is oriented towards the resolution of problems that arise in the context of practice. An important feature of experimental inquiry is that problems are not taken as merely \"given\" but are progressively defined in the process of the search for their solution. As we will show herein, certain mechanisms put to work by participants can be described as \"experimentalist\" in this sense. One noteworthy feature of these epistemic practices is that in most of the cases they worked without facilitators, relying solely on self-organization and mutual support. This stands in contrast to many forms of deliberation, for example, lottocratic assemblies (e.g., Fishkin, 2018) or participatory budgeting committees (Gilman, 2012), in which the role of facilitators is decisive (see also Lee, 2015 on the facilitation industry). Our case is different in this respect, a fact on which we reflect more in Section 4. As we mentioned, the first of the tensions participants in the camp had to deal with was between the democratic ideals of horizontality and maximal inclusion, and the manifest differences in knowledge and skills that existed between individuals. These differences concerned a wide range of issues, from technical knowledge to familiarity with behavioral and aesthetic codes. Some participants possessed useful technical knowledge acquired in previous camps, in their professional lives, or in their free time activities, while others dealt with electricity and water infrastructures for the first time. Some had more experience in organizing, since they have participated in the preparation of this or other camps, while others had never participated in organizing teams. Those who arrived first had a better overview on the camp, while newcomers needed to find their way into the different activities, groups, and social spaces. Some were able to master terminologies and behavioral codes, thanks to their year-long activism and their membership in a certain \"political culture,\" while others were not at all familiar with social norms about the \"right\" clothes to wear or the \"appropriate\" terms to use. Some were experts in environmental justice, carbon extraction, or urban mobility while others were in the camp precisely to learn more about these or other topics. Participants were not only aware of the different social-structural, cultural, historical, psychological or merely circumstantial reasons for the existing differences in knowledge. They were also very much aware of the danger created by these differences for the realization of their democratic ideals. For example, they spoke of the risks of a \"dominant culture of discussion\" (Ronja: 12:07) which \"imposes certain concepts\" (Toni: 5:32), the exclusionary effects of certain forms of \"community knowledge,\" the hierarchical superiority of the organizational team as an expert team (Ronja 12:07), or the exclusionary effects of the use of certain languages for those less fluent in them (Toni 02:08). In view of the risks of hierarchization (where one person tells others what to do or how to do it) and exclusion (where some cannot fully participate in decision-making and in the tasks at hand) based on differences in knowledge and skills, participants used different mechanisms and strategies with the aim of curbing these tendencies and promoting horizontal relations and maximal inclusion. There are, of course, actors with certain skills, with more information, who are more connected than others, but the emphasis placed on the diffusion and transferring of these skills and information demonstrates the belief that even these practical knowledge, held by a particular someone, ought to be circulated and spread across the network. The type of knowledge that is most resisted by this movement is the type that claims to know better, to know what should be done, to know what will happen next\u2014the knowledge of prediction. (2009, p. 125) Accordingly, we have identified those mechanisms which prevented hierarchies from arising at all, or which minimized their reproduction over time. According to Maeckelbergh, social movement actors are aware that this requires constant awareness and the creation and recreation of equality (2009, p. 162). Here, our observations diverge somewhat from her analysis. Even if the mechanisms and strategies that we describe below were sometimes made explicit and reflected upon, sometimes they represented habitualized patterns of interaction which worked mostly unconsciously. In fact, for those who were for the first time in contact with the political culture of the camp, the habitualized character of certain patterns of horizontalization represented a particular challenge, which was made explicit by some of our interviewees. The list in Table 1, which we discuss in detail below, aims at systematizing the interaction patterns in which actors mobilized epistemic resources in order to articulate, and deal with, problems, while at the same time (intentionally or not) promoting horizontalization and maximizing inclusion. The first feature of these epistemic practices of horizontalization and inclusion can be described, along Deweyan lines, as an understanding of knowledge-production and cooperation as experimental endeavors. As noted earlier, experimentalism also means that new relevant problems and topics may arise in the course of action or that they may be redefined by participants. This all involves a fundamental openness to different forms of innovation, as well as the valorization of activities that \"try things out.\" We distinguish four horizontalizing patterns that embody this experimentalist approach.

      "abstract": "In recent years, scholarly discourse has been dominated by concerns about the political public sphere: fake news and conspiracy theories are seen to have gained credence in \"the age of social media,\" strong polarization characterizes public debates even in established democracies, and, information abundance notwithstanding, more and more people appear to be disengaged from political news. In addition, print is unlikely to have a future; the prospects look equally bleak for linear TV programs. While more voices can permeate the public debate, only a handful of media enterprises are in control of the information market. Again, the field has turned to J\u00fcrgen Habermas' groundbreaking perspective on the structural changes of the public sphere, first published more than 60 years ago. As before, it is displaying theoretical strength: better than any other approach, it seems capable of showing us the bigger picture. On top of that, Habermas again took up his seminal analysis in his latest contribution to political theory, a small book on the New Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (Habermas, 2022). In the book, Habermas emphasizes again the relevance of public discourse and deliberation for contemporary democracy and criticizes, rightly so, the distortions that capitalist structures and economic logic cause for democratic processes. While many of the patterns Habermas described in the original version of The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1992 [1962]) are still relevant,1 it is also necessary to consider what has changed. On the one hand, this means examining aspects that have varied in Habermas' analyses. On the other hand, it means including aspects that are missing entirely from his reflections. To these ends, my remarks first look at the role of journalists and other actors in the public sphere. Despite the persistence of economic interests in mass media organizations, Habermas' latest work sometimes appears nostalgic for mass media journalism's democratic performance while neglecting the achievements or potentials of non-professional actors on digital media platforms. Drawing on the concept of \"opinion leadership,\" I argue instead that we should concentrate our evaluations of the digital public sphere not only on professional expertise and norms, but also on the merits of independence, the ethos of community dedication, and on what determines trustworthiness. Second, my contribution focuses on the \"sub-structures\" of the public sphere that do not play an important role in Habermas' reflections, but which influence democratic processes in manifold ways. Digital media not only reinforce economic concentration, lead to a fragmentation of the political sphere, and provoke a less rational style of discourse. They also draw public attention away from the local or regional level and towards high-level politic, which\u2014at the same time\u2014provokes widespread depoliticization. Despite the growing availability of all kinds of information, regional and local politics tend to go unnoticed by most citizens. In addition, the number of people completely decoupled from political information is on the rise. I maintain that not only does this set into motion processes of re-nationalization and strengthens right-wing populism, but that it also challenges the embeddedness of political parties in society and it endangers representation of regional interests and perspectives in the public sphere. First, a self-regulating media system must maintain its independence vis-\u00e0-vis its environments while linking political communication in the political sphere with both civil society and the political center; second, an inclusive civil society must empower citizens to participate in and respond to a public discourse that, in turn, must not degenerate into a colonizing mode of communication. (Habermas, 2006, p. 420) In the tradition of the Frankfurt School's first generation, Habermas' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere argues that the risk of colonization is especially high under the conditions of a commercialized media system. In the early days of journalism, \"private men of letters\" (Habermas, 1992, p. 188) had limited themselves to transmitting the rational-critical debate of private people to a public, without pursuing economic aims. Together with the bourgeois salons, Habermas argues, their journalistic work paved the way for the creation of a more inclusive and institutionalized democratic public. However, the establishment of mass media in the 19th century led to a structural change of the public sphere: media contents adjusted to follow the wants and tastes of the masses, which were influenced by the advertising industry, thus blurring the lines between private and public concern in both form and content. As a result, publicity no longer reached its full democratic potential, and, fundamentally compromised by commercialization, \"The history of the big daily papers in the second half of the nineteenth century proves that the press itself became manipulable to the extent that it became commercialized\" (Habermas, 1992, p. 185). Neither film nor broadcasting could help improve the situation, since these technologies' degrees of economic concentration and their dependence on vast capital investments was even higher than that of newspaper publishing. This seems to point to the pessimistic conclusion that political debate in the commercialized public sphere has lost its independence and critical edge and that, instead, it has become sensationalized and trivialized. Without any doubt, Habermas' historical reconstruction is impressive. It offers a powerful narrative of the rise and fall of democratic institutions in the modern world. Nevertheless, a lot of criticism\u2014some of it vigorous\u2014has been directed toward his original theory.2 Not only was Habermas accused of idealizing the bourgeois public sphere and its actors, but his normative account of the proper role of media in democracy has also been challenged, and his analysis of the media system has been rejected as too static and monolithic (e.g., Baker, 2002; Benson, 2009; Ferree et al., 2002; Wessler, 2008). The theory's biggest challenger appears to be the success story that marked the history of democracy in the second half of the 20th century: in addition to the rise in the number of democratically ruled states, the expected \"legitimation crisis\" (Habermas, 1975) did not materialize. Because Habermas did not sufficiently consider the public sphere's internal organization and differentiation, so the argument goes, he was unable to acknowledge the potential and functionality of mass media. Instead, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere is seen to offer a simplistic and biased perspective: \"Habermas tends to judge the eighteenth century by Locke and Kant, the nineteenth century by Marx and Mill, and the twentieth century by the typical suburban television viewer\" (Calhoun, 1992, p. 33). The natural conclusion of such a perspective, of course, is to overestimate the degeneration of the public sphere. Regarding Habermas' latest writings about a \"new\" structural change of the public sphere (Habermas, 2021, 2022), the important question is whether this critique still stands. In the digital media world, the suburban television viewer has, of course, to be substituted by a\u2014probably right-wing\u2014social media warrior, who spends a lot of time in polarized echo chambers, tends to trust similar-minded online-\"friends,\" and who is thus at high risk of no longer being able to differentiate between facts and fake news. His counterpart is a mass media journalist, a member of the editorial staff of a newspaper or broadcasting station, who acts based on professional expertise and norms, making \"valuable contributions\" (Habermas, 2022, p. 23) to the public sphere that help educate citizens. Today, according to Habermas, it is not the (low) quality of mass-media journalism that primarily challenges the democratic functioning of the public sphere, but the competition it faces in compelling the public's attention and, consequently, the economic problems that arise from shrinking advertising revenues. For Habermas (2022), the \"two decisive parameters of public communication\" (p. 40) are range and deliberative quality\u2014and whether the democratic throughput-process succeeds depends on the behavior of the recipients. While the younger Habermas saw primarily media companies and political and societal elites in charge, the older one focuses on the audience. This shift is remarkable, for economic concentration in the global media-market has risen substantially, and, so far, few political measures have been taken in Western democracies to effectively regulate the power of digital media companies like Google, Facebook, or Twitter. On the one hand, Habermas' \"audience turn\" (Habermas, 2022, p. 56) mirrors the empowerment that goes along with the digital revolution: not only can anyone receive political information, but anyone has also the ability to be heard. On the other hand, this is a rather bridled perspective on the state versus individual responsibility for a leftist theorist. In this regard, Habermas does not sufficiently consider the complexity of media use, trust relations, and role differentiations. However, the picture we paint in Political Science of the digital public sphere should neither be marked by nostalgia nor remain incomplete. Habermas' \"new structural change\" convincingly argues that fragmentation, post-truth politics, the dictate of entertainment, and polarization endanger deliberation in contemporary democracies. It considers the emancipatory potential that the expanded media structure offers. As a next step, we should develop an analytical frame that allows for a closer reconstruction and a more precise analysis of information processes and will-formation within the new structures of the public sphere. In this constellation, media consumers do not often reflect much on whether information is provided by professionals, friends, or others; they react to whatever appears on their timelines, focusing on their individual networks and on appealing claims. So, the formal status and the competence of information-givers become less relevant, and the credibility and relevance of their messages depend more strongly on personal relations and networks. Therefore, any systematic analysis of characteristics of the digital public sphere should indeed start with the audience, for habits, routines, interests, intentions, and experiences influence the political information process more strongly than ever before. A promising avenue in research is thus a focus on \"opinion leadership\"\u2014despite the fact that this theoretical approach developed by Lazarsfeld et al. (2021/1944) is even older than The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere. Yet, recapitulating the analysis of information networks, focusing on the interplay of mediated and direct communication, and investigating the conditions under which trustworthiness and credibility are attributed can help us identify the roles that different types of actors play in today's public sphere, track developments over time, and evaluate the impact of new media on discourse quality. Potentially, this not only allows us to assess the relative importance of professional media actors, established elites, or prominent \"influencers,\" but also to uncover hidden structures that shape political deliberation in contemporary democracies. For example, this could equip us to identify today's \"private men of letters,\" evaluate their influence, and analyze their resources and motives. Such an analysis might not only help mitigate our concerns about the risks of digital media. In addition, it may create the foundation for media policy advice and could thus help shape the complex digital media \"universe\" (Ritzi, 2021) itself. As well founded and important as the critiques of Habermas and others on the digital public sphere are, because there is no going back to a pre-digital media landscape, political theory should develop strategies for democratically shaping public communication and political discourse in the 21st century. The imperative to take a closer look at the public sphere's internal organization extends to the content that gains attention in the digital age. One important\u2014but in the literature rarely discussed\u2014consequence of the decreasing subscription of newspapers (see Breunig et al., 2020; Lang, 2003) is the development of information blindness. Information on local or regional politics seems to reach significantly fewer people than it used to, and there is no indication for a contradicting development in the digital sphere. The focus of hashtag activism and of debates in social media echo chambers and online news media lies predominantly in national or even supra-national politics. The economies of scale that drive platform companies might be one reason for this concentration on topics that are of interest to large numbers of people. That only a small percentage of online users are willing to pay for journalistic contents is another (see Jarren & Fischer, 2021). In addition, communication culture appears to have changed: political discussants seem to bond less over territorial proximity than over shared interests or ideologies; in consequence, local and regional politics are pushed from the agenda. This development is alarming because local and regional politics are important avenues for different forms of political participation, sites of political socialization, and indispensable suppliers of support for party headquarters. The legitimacy of political decision-making suffers from the growing distance between citizens and politics or even their alienation from each other. We can also expect that disregard for lower level political decision-making will contribute to shrinking levels of political interest and also that parties are going to face even tougher challenges for recruitment. Given the abundance of information in the digital age, we are confronted with a paradoxical situation: while in the 20th century, the supply of regional and local information\u2014mainly delivered by profitable newspapers\u2014did not depend on political intervention, today media politics must innovate if it wants to ensure ample availability of news on platforms and forums that correspond to usage patterns and preferences. A content-oriented funding system\u2014as practiced in New Zealand\u2014could be one cornerstone of modern media policy, but of course, national contexts, institutions, traditions, and characteristics must be considered as well. Constructing an attractive information landscape is not only necessary to prevent blind spots regarding local or regional information. In addition, it may help prevent particularly younger citizens from becoming politically disconnected. Misinformation and information biases are not the only illnesses of the digital public sphere. The Internet also allows non-politicized media usage to an unprecedented extent: users can enjoy endless entertainment with streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime without being interrupted even once by news or other aspects of real community life. The motive for such media usage might not only be political disinterest, but also \"strategic illiteracy\" (Plaut, 2022), cultivated to avoid the challenges of overwhelming information supply, disturbing complexity, and potential manipulation. So far, individuals who avoid information that might otherwise reduce their pleasure or increase stress levels constitute a minority. Nevertheless, in \"the age of post-truth,\" their numbers can be expected to rise. According to several studies in participation research, the \"strategic illiterates\" within the group of politically disinterested people share typical socio-economic characteristics that might trigger or reinforce (perceived) representation biases (see, e.g., Sch\u00e4fer & Z\u00fcrn, 2021). Political education might help empower some of the disconnected and strengthen their internal efficacy\u2014but success is bound to individual openness and interest. Instead, a media landscape that does not provoke strategic disconnection is likely to prove more effective in keeping the citizenry in touch with politics. is compromised, when the public sphere as an infrastructure is no longer able to direct the citizen's attention to relevant topics which need to become subject to public decision-making as well as when it proves unable to provoke the formation of competing \u2013 and this means qualitatively filtered \u2013 opinions. (Habermas, 2022, p. 65, own translation) However, beyond frequently discussed phenomena like Trump's fake news regime and Corona-denying echo chambers in parts of Germany, the digitalized public sphere has many more sub-structures. Since the invention of Gutenberg's printing press, a myriad of social, economic, and political forces have shaped the political public sphere. Over the past 30 years, globalization and technological innovations have led to a situation that is more complex and fast-changing than ever. Therefore, in the digital age, it is all the more important that contemporary democratic theory not only describes the different structures and sub-structures of the public sphere and discusses their implications for democracy, but that it also focuses on their relations to each other. Thus, we are now faced with the extremely difficult task of figuring out whether the observed forces and structures are part of a balanced system that, overall, fulfills the public sphere's democratic functions\u2014or whether we are being confronted with dangerous, anti-democratic trends.3 The more indicators we find that speak to the latter, the more important it becomes for democratic theory to work on possible solutions as well as to criticize the status quo. It must do so in an interdisciplinary manner in order to be more innovative, more purposeful, and considerably more critical and provocative than are the rather vague references to the significance of journalism and political education, which currently inform most contributions in democratic theory. We must take a closer look into the internal structures of the public sphere than Habermas' analysis does, which focuses on the groundwork instead of tracing and explaining the different fragments of the digital public sphere. These new perspectives might most easily link up with the theoretical perspective on \"complex democracies\" (Benson, 2009, p. 17) that integrates aspects of the deliberative and the elitist (gatekeeper) model as well as constructivist perspectives. In any case, they will have to focus on media systems and media regulations as well as on cultural influences and societal changes. \"Today, 'Public Sphere' has become almost a clich\u00e9 and is perhaps one of the most frequently used words in sociology of media and communications,\" stated Rodney Benson (2009, p. 179) more than 10 years ago regarding the impact of Habermas' works. An inherently broad concept like the public sphere will always be at risk of being imprecise. However, given the relevance of deliberation studies in the digital age, \"public sphere\" will continue to be a pivotal term in contemporary scholarly discourse. Habermas' latest works provide proof that it is worth sticking with the term: the structural transformations of the public sphere are of great importance for democratic quality and stability. To analyze relevant changes carefully\u2014those that are obvious as well as those more hidden\u2014will help shape public discourse, media systems, and normative orientations in a democratic fashion. By embracing this ambition, the \"public sphere\" will always be a fundamental perspective\u2014and therefore much more than a clich\u00e9.

      "abstract": "Since the financial and economic crisis started in 2008, the acceptability of neoliberalism is increasingly challenged. Arguably, the current situation can be described in Gramscian terms (Gramsci, 1971) as the hegemonic crisis of neoliberalism (Caruso, 2016; Stahl, 2019). Thus, while remaining dominant, neoliberalism has lost its legitimacy: The ruling classes still rule, but they no longer enjoy the consensus of the ruled. This rupture between the \"people\" and the economic and political elites is visible in citizens' abstention in political elections and low membership rates in political parties (Mair, 2006), in the rise of \"populism\" (D'Eramo, 2013; Mouffe, 2005; Streeck, 2017; Wilson & Swyngedouw, 2014) and in the emergence of social movements for justice and democracy (della Porta, 2015; Glasius & Pleyers, 2013; Kaldor & Selchow, 2013; Tejerina et al., 2013). Thus, like in Gramsci's times, we face today a \"crisis of politics,\" which produces a \"new crossroads\" between \"authoritarianism\"\u2014represented by nationalist and xenophobic populism\u2014and \"democratization\" (Caruso, 2016, p. 156; Fraser, 2017; Rehmann, 2016). Against this background, the ideal of social citizenship may be especially important for building progressive alternatives to neoliberalism (Revi, 2014). The scholarly literature has emphasized that in the neoliberal context, social citizenship is under pressure (e.g., Kurachanis, 2020; Taylor-Gooby, 2008). In particular, given the substantive evidence that welfare retrenchment and austerity erode social citizenship (Edmiston, 2017), contemporary efforts to develop progressive alternatives to neoliberalism have focused on improving social policy generosity, most notably through the \"social investment\" agenda. This new welfare model seems to enable the reinforcement of social citizenship in a post-industrial, globalized, knowledge-based economy (Evers & Guillemard, 2013). Social investment aims to rebuild social policy around the enhancement of individuals\" human capital and their inclusion in the labor market, emphasizing both the social and economic returns of social policy. This agenda has now emerged as one of the dominant frameworks for welfare reform at the global level, being highly influential among the EU and international organizations, such as the OECD and the World Bank, as well as among social policy scholars (Deeming & Smyth, 2019; Esping-Andersen, 2002; Hemerijck, 2018; Jenson, 2010, 2017a; Mahon, 2010; Young Jun et al., 2021). In this context, the debate on the relationship between social investment and neoliberalism focuses on the degree of social policy generosity: Social investment provides an alternative to neoliberalism because it promotes social policy rather than implementing austerity measures (Abrahamson, 2010; Deeming & Smyth, 2015; Ferrera, 2013; Hemerijck, 2018; Jenson, 2010; Morel et al., 2012; Perkins et al., 2005). In the same vein, distinct versions of social investment are differentiated on the basis of their generosity degree: While the social\u2013democratic version combines compensatory policies (social protection) with social investment policies centered on human capital enhancement, the \"Third Way\" version partially replaces the former with the latter, thereby providing a weaker break with neoliberalism (Deeming & Smyth, 2015; Morel et al., 2012). However, framing the debate in this manner overlooks the logics and the normative\u2013epistemological assumptions that inform social policy promotion. Indeed, while enhancing social policy generosity constitutes an indispensable step for overcoming neoliberalism, it may be insufficient. In this paper, I argue that the view that equates a post-neoliberal social citizenship with the promotion of social policy is problematic because it involves a rather limited understanding of both social citizenship\u2014which is identified with welfare benefits and services\u2014and neoliberalism, which is defined as welfare retrenchment. Drawing from the normative literature on the ideal of social citizenship and the literature on neoliberalism, this paper thus contributes to the debate on how theorizing social citizenship after neoliberalism. The paper is organized as follows. The next section builds on various normative theories of social citizenship for emphasizing the importance of its political\u2013democratic dimension. The third section, drawing from the literature on neoliberalism, provides a refined interpretation of the latter that goes beyond its narrow identification with austerity and welfare retrenchment. In particular, I argue that neoliberalism does not necessarily involve a \"quantitative\" reduction of social policy generosity and that it is also important to interrogate the \"qualitative\" dimension of social policy, i.e., the logic that informs the promotion of social policies, the goals that these policies pursue as well as the social\u2013political processes that generate them. From this viewpoint, neoliberalism entails the marginalization of the political\u2013democratic dimension of social citizenship. Using this framework, the fourth and fifth sections propose a theory of social\u2013inclusive versions of neoliberalism, distinguishing them from alternatives to neoliberalism. Finally, the conclusion elaborates on some implications of this framework for the work of social policy scholars. It is always valuable and intensely practical to consider where our conduct stands in relation to an ideal, since in that way we can try to improve. It is essential to take this approach \u2026 rather than the more common one, which is to scale down definitions of the ideal so that they conform to what we easily achieve. That way lies complacency, self-congratulation, and an absence of concern to identify ways in which democracy is being weakened. Arguably, the ideal of social citizenship represents more than just a set of welfare benefits and services. For example, the fact that social policy has often been promoted by authoritarian regimes (Mares & Carnes, 2009) suggests that the ideal of social citizenship should involve something different than the mere provision of services and benefits. Indeed, social citizenship implies a specific way in which \"welfare provision ought to be viewed\" (King & Waldron, 1988, p. 422, emphasis in original). In particular, from a normative perspective, social citizenship involves two aspects: It is both an inherent component of democracy and the result of democratic practice. Before going into the details of these two dimensions, let me emphasize here that the ideal of social citizenship presented below embraces a \"radical\" understanding of democracy (Cohen & Fung, 2004). While internally heterogenous,11 I do not have the space here to discuss the different conceptions of democracy that broadly share this normative ideal\u2014and the tensions between them. For different theories of \"participatory,\" \"deliberative,\" and \"radical\" democracy, see, e.g., Barber (1984), Laclau and Mouffe (1985), Habermas (1994), Wolin (1994), Benhabib (1996), Elster (1998), Dryzek (2000), Young (2002), Parkinson and Mansbridge (2012), and Pateman (2012). this conceptualization of democracy seeks a \"fuller realization of democratic values\" with respect to the \"conventional\" and minimalist model of democracy centered on \"competitive representation,\" whereby citizens advance their private interests by voting for representatives in regular elections in which political parties compete for governing (Cohen & Fung, 2004, p. 23). In particular, radical democracy endorses both participation and deliberation with a view to promoting three goals: reinforcing the accountability of representatives, increasing political equality, and enabling collective self-government for the common good (Cohen & Fung, 2004, pp. 24\u201327). Hence, in the following the main concern is to highlight how social policy can be conceived as an inherent component of a participatory and deliberative democracy as well as the result of participatory and deliberative practices. In this context, citizens are not only the addressees but also the authors of social policy. This conceptualization of citizens as simultaneously \"addressees\" and \"authors\" of laws and policies stems from Habermas and his \"co-originality\" thesis, which affirms that individuals' basic rights and liberties are coherently and internally related to citizens' democratic rights to political participation, i.e., that private and public autonomy are interdependent and require each other (e.g., Habermas, 2001). This perspective is not without problems (e.g., Cooke, 2020), but I do not have the space to address this discussion here. What I believe remains convincing of the co-originality thesis is the insight that both individuals' rights and binding collective norms are promoted more effectively and more legitimately through the real struggle of social actors in the political arena and actual deliberation/contestation among the affected citizens rather than through top-down governance (Schaffer, 2015). With this premise in mind, I now turn to the two dimensions of the social citizenship ideal. The first dimension involves an understanding of social rights as inherent components of democracy. Hence, social citizenship aims at promoting citizens' full participation in society and gives substance to civil and political rights that otherwise would be only formally granted, remaining in reality a privilege of the wealthy and well educated. This conception has a long tradition: Safeguarding citizens' equality of status and their full participation in society is, for example, a central theme in Marshall's conceptualization of social citizenship (Marshall, 1950). The central concern in this first aspect of social citizenship is the establishment of the social preconditions of democracy: The goal is to sustain political equality or \"equal citizenship\" (Anderson, 1999). In this context, \"we ought to associate welfare with citizenship because our concept of citizenship will be radically impoverished if we do not\": citizenship, \"demands welfare provision; we cannot have an adequate or attractive notion of citizenship without it\" (King & Waldron, 1988, p. 423, emphasis in original). Hence, this first dimension of social citizenship highlights the fact that one of the central aims of social policy is that of redistributing powers rather than only goods and resources (de Leonardis, 1998, p. 86). Another implication of seeing social rights as components of democratic citizenship concerns the rationale of social policy. Thus, \"to associate welfare provision with citizenship\" is a way of making \"a proposal about how welfare should be handled in society\": e.g., people are provided for need without \"supplication or stigma\" (King & Waldron, 1988, p. 422). In particular, social citizenship involves the principles of solidarity and noncontractual reciprocity, following a rationale beyond the logics of \"charity\" and \"contract\" (Fraser & Gordon, 1992). Charity is a \"unilateral gift,\" on which the recipient has no claim, for which the donor has no obligation and which gives \"moral credit\" to the giver and stigmatization and disrespect to the \"taker,\" thereby perpetuating power asymmetries and relationships of dependency between donors and receivers (Fraser & Gordon, 1992, p. 59). In contrast, solidarity involves the rights and mutual obligations of the members of a political community, and it has legal value (Kohn, 2015). Individuals in this perspective are subjects of rights rather than objects of benevolence. Moreover, the logic of social citizenship differs not only from the moral rationale of charity but also from the economic rationale of \"contract.\" As Marshall (1950, p. 68) argues, social citizenship partially supplants the logic of \"contract\" that characterizes capitalism with the rationale of social rights and of \"status,\" replacing \"free bargain by the declaration of right.\" Hence, a democratic society should be more than a market. Indeed, contracts involve voluntary interactions between individuals within the private sphere rather than obligations based on demands and claims emanating from the public sphere. Moreover, the market\u2014like charity\u2014tends to reproduce inequalities, whereas democracy and political equality require substantive social equality. The second dimension of social citizenship involves less its outcomes in terms of rights and obligations than the processes through which social citizenship comes into being and is implemented. Hence, social citizenship\u2014as citizenship in general\u2014is not only a status or a bundle of rights and duties but also a \"practice\" with participation representing one of its core dimensions (Bellamy, 2008; Isin et al., 2008). In this view, social citizenship is a \"social process,\" which belongs to the realm of \"agency\" and the logic of \"acting\" rather than to the field of \"ownership\" and the logic of \"having\"; individuals are active citizens rather than passive consumers of goods and services; and social rights are closer to political rather than property rights (de Leonardis, 1998, pp. 175\u2014178). From this perspective, social citizenship requires the practice of democracy within \"civil society,\" whereby ordinary people have the opportunity to participate in shaping the political agenda through self-organized associations and taking part into public deliberation. Following the Gramscian conception of civil society, Fraser (1989, p. 301) defines the \"social\" as the arena\u2014noncoincident with the family, the economy and the state\u2014in which \"successfully politicized runaway needs get translated into claims for government provision.\" The \"social\" is thus the sphere in which discourses about needs take place and demands on government are developed. The focus is on citizens' effective possibility to take part in the collective definition of the common \"problems\" and \"solutions,\" participating at the co-construction of society (de Leonardis, 1998). The point here is not only that rights\u2014even \"human rights\"\u2014are artifacts rather than naturally given and thus necessarily require political struggle and claim-making (Dean, 2015) but also that social policy has a \"political function\" as \"multiplier of democracy\": What matters is not only the satisfaction of needs and the realization of rights but the \"public discourse on needs and rights,\" i.e., the discussion on the kind of society we want to build (de Leonardis, 1999, pp. 33\u201334). Hence, instead of focusing only on the role that social policy plays in improving the quality of life of individuals and families within the private sphere through the distribution of goods and the provision of services that respond to these individual and private needs, this perspective highlights the potential contribution of welfare states to the quality of public life and the practice of citizenship (de Leonardis, 1998). Social citizenship then implies a \"deliberative welfare,\" which institutionalizes debates \"about well-being and the good life\" (Fitzpatrick, 2002, p. 167). Taken together, the two aspects described above imply a \"reflexive\" model of social citizenship (Olson, 2006). On the one hand, welfare states establish the social preconditions of political equality, guaranteeing that citizens are equally equipped for taking part in democratic deliberation (i.e., social rights are an inherent and necessary component of democratic citizenship). On the other hand, citizens actively participate in the politics of welfare so that they can conceive themselves as the coauthors of social citizenship. Articulating \"redistribution,\" \"recognition,\" and \"participation,\" social policies conceive individuals as citizens rather than beneficiaries, i.e., \"subjects\" rather than \"objects\" of policies (Lister, 2001, 2007). Indeed, social policies\u2014at the level of both their actual functioning and their discursive frame\u2014shape citizens' identity and the relationship between them and the state, thereby either reinforcing or undermining democratic citizenship (D\u00f3sa, 2018). This two-dimensional conception of social citizenship also partly reflects the historical development of welfare states, which often emerged from struggles for social justice and democracy by a politicized civil society composed of associations, social movements, cooperatives, mutual societies, trade unions and workers' parties (Powell, 2009). In this context, the terms \"social policy\" and \"welfare state\" should be understood broadly. For example, social rights also include labor rights. Thus, social citizenship involves not only the provision of services and benefits by the state \"outside\" the economy but also the regulation of the latter in the public interest. In this respect, the postwar international order of \"embedded liberalism\" (Ruggie, 1982) implied the regulation of international trade and especially capital control, which provided national states with relative autonomy in pursuing social and economic policies. In this context, the labor movement (esp. trade unions and mass parties) gave a political voice to ordinary people, promoting the democratization of state policies (Crouch, 2004). Crucially, despite its merits and approximations, the historical concretization of social citizenship in the postwar welfare state does not realize the ideal of social citizenship outlined above. As Fraser (2013, pp. 127\u2013128) makes it clear, postwar welfare arrangements often treated their beneficiaries as clients rather than citizens, and they excluded women, minorities, and postcolonial peoples. Hence, while the remainder of this paper is concerned with studying the ways in which neoliberalism undermines the ideal of social citizenship, this critique should not be confused with a nostalgic view of the postwar compromise as a \"golden age of democracy and social justice\"\u2014a view that would turn \"a blind eye to some of the serious gender- and race-based oppressions that sustained that order\" (Cahill & Konings, 2017, p. 120). Thus, as Crouch (2004) does for democracy, it is possible to interpret social citizenship as a continuum in which its concrete historical realizations are more or less distant from the normative ideal. Although postwar welfare states do not represent the ideal of social and political justice, the end of the social\u2013democratic compromise and the emergence of neoliberalism implied processes of \"dedemocratization\" (Brown, 2006; Freeman, 2018; Kiely, 2017) and thus an even greater departure from this ideal. Indeed, given the difficulties in finding an alternative social base to the working class for representing the general interest of society and for promoting democratization, the decline of the working class is strongly connected not only with the erosion of the welfare state but also with the emergence of \"post-democracy,\" whereby economic and political inequalities return to levels similar to pre-democratic times (Crouch, 2004). While it is beyond the scope of the paper to provide an exhaustive definition of neoliberalism, scholars have proposed two different interpretations of neoliberalism that are relevant for the argument that follows. A first strand of the literature defines neoliberalism as the ideology of the dominant class and as the political project aimed at reaffirming capitalist class power after the postwar social\u2013democratic compromise (Dum\u00e9nil & L\u00e9vy, 2004; Harvey, 2005). In this perspective, neoliberalism is associated with the promotion of the interests of the economic elites (especially big corporations) and thus with the concentration not only of income and wealth but also of political power (Crouch, 2011). Importantly, neoliberalism does not entail the minimal state but its subordination to capitalist interests (Howell, 2015). With the liberalization of international (especially financial) markets, national states lose their autonomy in social and economic policies and are compelled to compete for attracting capital and investments: democratically responsive welfare states are transformed into more to global than to citizens 2014). A second of following neoliberalism with a based on of the and of which aims at subjects and in terms and at economic & 2008; In this second perspective, neoliberalism is associated with processes of of the whereby the economic is to and the is to the is, a project that economic principles for governing human in of social Crucially, the fact that this project is a one does not imply that it has no political are \"to like in terms of through the of the logic 2008, pp. Moreover, this should not be confused with a Indeed, the of which for state as long as they are & 2014).

      "abstract": "The concept of ecological limits is sometimes deemed a kind of natural determinism that unreasonably constrains a political community's collective liberty to determine its own fate. Limits straitjacket political deliberation and action, undemocratically favouring management by experts. This chapter considers the implications for liberty of perspectives that either embrace or attempt to deny limits. The central argument is that recognition and embrace of limits, both human and ecological, enhances liberty of a particular sort, i.e. republican liberty as collective self-government among equal citizens. This chapter discusses two political values that connect liberty to limits: vulnerability and non-domination. Non-domination emerges from the civic republican tradition, while vulnerability has roots in republicanism and other perspectives, including feminist theory. Together, these two values promote a collective democratic liberty in contrast to the domineering, instrumentalizing impulse that characterizes the drive to transcend limits. Thus, while the Anthropocene presents stringent ecological constraints as we come up against various planetary boundaries, these limits do not mean that certain forms of liberty cannot flourish. In developing this argument, the chapter critiques two contemporary perspectives, ecomodernism, and transhumanism. Both reject natural limits in favour of some notion of collective liberty and self-determination but end up actually threatening liberty.",

      "abstract": "Migration is doubtless one of the most politicized issues of our time. Since the tragic events of 2015, which culminated in what has become known as the European refugee crisis, Western societies seem to be more divided than ever before. Migration is not only heating up public debate; but it is also a divisive topic within political theory. Over the course of the last decade, an intense and as yet unresolved struggle has emerged about the rights of immigrants, the importance of citizenship, and the nation state's future role. Should borders be open as Carens (2015), Cole (2011), and other open border theorists suggest? Or should states retain their right to closure, as is argued by Walzer (1983), Miller (2016), and other thinkers in the liberal-nationalist tradition? Should settled immigrants enjoy the same rights as citizens? Or should they remain excluded from the social and political life of their host states until they have gone through the naturalization process? Without taking sides on any of these opposing positions, this article addresses one problem that all of them have in common: They neglect the political agency of their target group, namely, the immigrants themselves. Immigrants are either granted or refused entry; they are either provided with or excluded from citizenship rights, but have no say in these decisions. As such, this raises an as yet neglected democratic problem. To realize the core democratic values of individual freedom and self-determination, rights alone are not enough. If rights are to develop their full emancipatory potential, they must be brought under the control of their holders, who are free in a fuller, republican sense of the term only if they have the power to shape the legal relationship that ties them to the state. To overcome the democratic deficits that most approaches to migration currently display, this article aims to shift the debate from a focus on the rights that migrants should be granted to a focus on the process through which these rights are determined. It agrees with defenders of rights-based accounts that migrants\u2014in a political order marked by distinct and bounded nation states\u2014cannot directly participate in the political process that defines their rights and obligations. But it argues that they can be included in an indirect way, namely, via their national governments in a multinational setting. Such a procedural rather than substantive approach to migration requires, though, that we move beyond the level of national states and develop a multinational response to the troubling questions of inclusion and exclusion that haunt all modern democracies. To do so, this article proceeds as follows: Part I discusses the central problem that all procedural responses to the question of migrant rights inevitably face: the democratic boundary problem. Part II examines one of its most prominent solutions, namely, Seyla Benhabib's discourse theory of democracy. Based on a critical reading of Benhabib's account, Part III argues that democratic deliberations within national demoi are not enough to strengthen the political agency of migrants and therefore must be complemented by democratic deliberations among national demoi. In institutional terms, the article promotes the creation of a multinational and hence reciprocity-based regime of migrant rights and explores its practical feasibility on the basis of two concrete examples: the Global Compact on Migration (Part IV) and European Union citizenship (Part V). The striking preeminence of substantive approaches that we find in normative debates on migration is certainly not surprising. As theorists working on the so-called democratic boundary problem have shown, all procedural responses to the question of migrant rights inevitably run into an irresolvable dilemma: Questions of inclusion and exclusion cannot be settled in a democratic way. Any attempt to include noncitizens in the political process that defines their rights would lead to a reductio ad absurdum. It would have to presuppose precisely what is at stake, namely, that noncitizens do have rights, at least the right to participate in foreign states' public decisions (Whelan, 1983). Faced with the boundary problem, most democratic theorists have so far opted for one of two contrasting positions: They either defend contemporary nations and their membership boundaries or seek to circumvent the problem of borders by creating a borderless world. The first approach is generally adopted by thinkers who follow a predominantly nationalist tradition. Most nationalist democrats do not deny that boundary decisions violate core democratic values insofar as they are enforced not only against insiders but also outsiders and hence against people who, by definition, have no say in their making. However, assuming that boundaries represent a necessary background condition for democracy, they argue that it is best to stick with the membership boundaries we find today and accept their undemocratic externalities as the price we have to pay for the high levels of democracy they facilitate within. Unsurprisingly, this position is firmly rejected by cosmopolitan thinkers. Emphasizing the inherently undemocratic nature of membership decisions, in contrast to nationalist democrats, they claim that democracy can be realized only in a global polity that knows of no boundaries and hence no status differences between different individuals or groups of people (Ochoa Espejo, 2020, p. 77). However, despite leading to diametrically opposed results, both approaches share a common deficit: They ignore the political agency of noncitizens. Noncitizens are either excluded from or included in the circle of rights-holders, but play no role in the corresponding decision-making process. This is particularly evident in the first approach that reserves this process exclusively for the national citizenry. Of course, in contrast to traditional nationalists who defend contemporary nations' claims to absolute discretion in the distribution of membership rights, liberal-nationalist thinkers such as Baub\u00f6ck (2005, 2015, 2018) or Rubio-Mar\u00edn (2000) have adopted a more nuanced position. Seeking to reconcile national and liberal-democratic values, they urge modern nation states to reform their membership boundaries by severing the link between rights and formal belonging. However, even such a revised nationalist account remains vulnerable to the criticism raised above. Even if it would grant immigrants more rights than they enjoy under current citizenship rules, it continues to treat them as passive rights-recipients instead of active political agents, who can influence the legal relationship that ties them to the state. Importantly, far from being of purely theoretical concern, this passivity has tangible consequences in practice. As long as migrants have no say in the political process that defines their rights, these rights remain vulnerable to reactionary trends and tendencies that might gain ground in their host or destination countries. Indeed, just as national governments can decide to enhance the rights of migrants, at the same time they remain free to alter such decisions and, what is more, can do so at relatively little cost: Those who are most likely to oppose such measures simply play no part in the competition for votes and public support.1 Similar problems of passivity can also be discerned in the second approach. Although promising to grant migrants exactly the same rights as citizens, cosmopolitan theories of democracy do not fare better when they are assessed in terms of migrants' democratic agency. The global polity that cosmopolitan thinkers dream off is rarely envisaged as the outcome of a democratic process, in which its future members could be included to gain power over their rights and entitlements. It is rather presented as a moral desideratum, which precedes democracy and hence leaves no room for questions of democratic agency to arise (Lupel, 2011, pp. 133\u2212136). An ostensibly elegant compromise between the two extremes of nationalist boundedness and cosmopolitan unboundedness can be found in the writings of Seyla Benhabib. Seeking to reconcile the existence of separate and independent nation states with their commitment to the freedom and equality of all people, Benhabib (2006) develops what she calls \"another\" cosmopolitanism, based not on open but porous borders. This porosity is guaranteed by the \"rights of others,\" which all noncitizens would be able to claim (Benhabib, 2004, pp. 220\u2212221). However, in striking contrast to the proposals discussed in the previous section, Benhabib's rights of others describe not a specific set or \"schedule of rights\" fixed in advance through moral or theoretical fiat. They must rather be understood as an abstract \"principle of rights,\" which must be substantiated in concrete political processes involving all parties concerned, namely, citizens and noncitizens alike. However, to avoid the problem of circularity described above, Benhabib promotes an indirect form of interest mediation. Even if migrants could not directly participate in the process that defines their rights, their interests would be protected by the requirement that all decisions be in line with everybody's human rights (Benhabib, 2004, pp. 140\u2212142). The specific type of proceduralism that Benhabib promotes becomes more tangible if we take a closer look at the concept of democratic iterations, which lies at the heart of her discursive approach. To translate migrants' abstract human rights into the concrete rights of others, which would be enforced by domestic courts, national citizenries have to engage in democratic iterations, that is, in \"complex processes of public argument, deliberation, and exchange through which universalist rights claims and principles are contested and contextualized, invoked and revoked, posited and reposited\" (Benhabib, 2004, p. 19). Although such an iterative process will not necessarily lead to the abolition of all status differences between citizens and migrants, it does change the status quo by limiting states' sovereignty in two important respects. First, it questions modern states' unconditional right to territorial closure, which Benhabib regards as incompatible with everybody's fundamental right to exit his or her political community.2 Second, it challenges absolute discretion over membership decisions, which compromises the democratic right of all individuals to participate in those laws to which they are subject (Benhabib, 1999, pp. 730\u2212732; 2004, p. 221). Based on this short overview, we can now return to the preceding section's analysis by examining whether or not Benhabib resolves the problem of political agency outlined at the beginning. Even if she improves over substantive approaches to migration by including the perspective of migrants in the political process that defines their rights, ultimately, she cannot fully avoid the criticism made against liberal-nationalist and cosmopolitan thinkers. To escape the pernicious circularity that haunts all procedural approaches to questions of inclusion and exclusion, Benhabib resorts to what Hans Lindahl (2009a, p. 137) calls a \"move from politics to morality.\" Although the claims of noncitizens are no longer ignored in the process of decision-making, they are incorporated as moral rather than political claims. Benhabib's discursive approach is thus not based on political reciprocity, which characterizes collective decision-making among fellow citizens. It rests instead on a less demanding form of reciprocity, which Benhabib describes as egalitarian. While as fellow humans but not fellow citizens migrants need not be given a right to participation, they must be given a right to justification (Benhabib, 2004, p. 13). Accordingly, the rights of others, which Benhabib offers as a response to the boundary problem, do indeed remain the rights we grant to those others whom we define as foreigners. However, they no longer depend on our goodwill or generosity, but are \"negotiated upon this terrain flanked by human rights on the one hand and sovereignty assertions on the other\" (Benhabib, 2004, p. 47). Strengthening the moral but not political agency of migrants, Benhabib's proposal faces a similar problem to that of liberal-nationalist and cosmopolitan accounts: although it has the potential to improve migrants' legal situation, it leaves their rights vulnerable to changing political moods in their host and destination countries. In contrast to the claims of citizens, the universal human rights of migrants simply have no binding force. Without being backed by the coercive powers of an overriding authority, they cannot become more than moral constraints, which a sovereign community decides to respect to cherish its constitutional commitments, but which it can equally put aside for the sake of other purposes or reasons (Lindahl, 2009b, pp. 5\u22126). Were the impact of outsiders' claims on the demos' iterative reconstitution to reach beyond such a voluntary self-limitation, another kind of reciprocity would be required. This must be political reciprocity, which distinguishes both parties as equal participants in the process of decision-making and hence as participants with legal and not only moral rights to have their interests represented and respected. Contrary to the assumption underlying Benhabib's approach, this section will demonstrate that the idea of political equality, as needed to restore the democratic agency of noncitizens, does not necessarily force us to abandon distinct, national communities and create a single world state. Nevertheless, so as to render it compatible with the existing political order, we must reconceptualize the rights of others which Benhabib proposes as a means of correcting the border and membership regimes of modern states. According to the view represented here, Benhabib's proposal finally falls short of fully developing the emancipatory potential within her account of migrant rights, because she views these rights as being intrinsically linked to a specific community, namely, ours. The rights of others are the rights of those migrants who seek entry and admission into our polity; they are the rights we will eventually grant them. Such a view, though, is problematic both conceptually and empirically. From a conceptual perspective, it necessarily leads to an asymmetrical dialog between citizens and aliens. The boundary which such a dialog should reshape is already built in to it; it is constitutive of the process itself (Lindahl, 2009b, p. 6). In empirical terms, any particularistic conception of migrant rights fails to do justice to the high levels of interdependency, interaction, and mutual mobility that exist between contemporary states and their members. In an increasingly mobile and interdependent world, we are no longer either citizens or aliens, but assume both roles at the same time. We are, ideally speaking, all potential migrants, who might eventually demand entry and residence in the others' states. As Benhabib herself suggests, the reason why we can take on the perspective of migrants and publicly defend their needs and interests is that \"we are all potentially strangers in other lands\" (Benhabib, 1999, p. 732; emphasis added). However, in a world that is neatly divided into distinct nation states, this means that we are all potentially strangers in each other's lands. Far from being merely a minor change in wording, such reformulation has transformative force. As soon as we acknowledge that we are not only citizens but always also potential migrants and not just migrants but always also potential citizens, sharing this double identity with those we generally regard as others, we can start to imagine a democratic process that is no longer based on asymmetry, but on reciprocity, or more precisely political reciprocity. As potential strangers in each other's lands, we would no longer need to enter into a moral dialog about the rights we should grant to others who seek entry and admission into our state. Rather, this could become a political dialogue about the rights we should grant to each other in our respective territories. Reconceptualizing the rights of others as rights that citizens and noncitizens grant to each other and hence as universal rather than particularistic migrant rights clearly implies a move beyond the national level. To include both citizens and aliens, Benhabib's democratic deliberations can no longer be limited to the domestic realm but would have to be institutionalized at a higher political level. In terms of institutional design, this article's revision of Benhabib's account thus seems to require the creation of a global assembly, albeit thematically limited, which in uniting different nations' citizens takes binding decisions on the rights that all of them could claim against the others' states. However, although such a reform would grant migrants an equal say over their own rights, thus effectively resolving the problem of agency, it nevertheless suffers from the same shortcomings as fully fledged cosmopolitan proposals: It would require a radical restructuring of the present world order and therefore can merely be regarded as an ideal solution to the lack of democratic agency that noncitizens face today. In any event, an elected legislative world assembly is not the only way in which the scope of democratic deliberation and decision-making can be expanded beyond national communities. To avoid the feasibility concerns associated with all forms of global democracy, as a second-best solution, the following paragraphs propose a shift from individual to collective political agency: Democratic deliberations about the rights of others would, in other words, no longer take place between individual political actors, be that at national or global level, but would instead involve collective political agents. Hence, different nations and their representatives would engage in joint deliberations about the entry and membership rights of international migrants. Based on these ideas, this article's response to the problem of political agency can now be specified further. If it should neither lead to a global polity nor collapse into a thin form of moral constraint, it must, as Benhabib argues, indeed be \"another\" cosmopolitanism, but another cosmopolitanism of a specific type: It must be multinational cosmopolitanism. The central actors here would still be existing nation states, but they would no longer enjoy absolute sovereignty over their internal affairs. When it comes to questions of inclusion, they would have to exercise their sovereignty in concert with all other members of the international community, which, through defining mutually binding migrant rights, jointly redefine the boundaries between them.3 to nationalist and cosmopolitan positions, which either the of collective or that of individual political agency over the multinational cosmopolitanism to equal to both and hence to reconcile the interests of migrants with those of their host and destination countries. from a procedural perspective, it political agency in a way that is compatible with the current political order and its of The rights of migrants would neither remain under the absolute discretion of national governments nor be by a global assembly, but would from common deliberations among all nation states.

      "abstract": "This paper concludes a special feature of Sustainability Science that explores a broad range of social value theoretical traditions, such as religious studies, social psychology, indigenous knowledge, economics, sociology, and philosophy. We introduce a novel transdisciplinary conceptual framework that revolves around concepts of \u2018lenses\u2019 and \u2018tensions\u2019 to help navigate value diversity. First, we consider the notion of lenses: perspectives on value and valuation along diverse dimensions that describe what values focus on, how their sociality is envisioned, and what epistemic and procedural assumptions are made. We characterise fourteen of such dimensions. This provides a foundation for exploration of seven areas of tension, between: (1) the values of individuals vs collectives; (2) values as discrete and held vs embedded and constructed; (3) value as static or changeable; (4) valuation as descriptive vs normative and transformative; (5) social vs relational values; (6) different rationalities and their relation to value integration; (7) degrees of acknowledgment of the role of power in navigating value conflicts. In doing so, we embrace the \u2018mess\u2019 of diversity, yet also provide a framework to organise this mess and support and encourage active transdisciplinary collaboration. We identify key research areas where such collaborations can be harnessed for sustainability transformation. Here it is crucial to understand how certain social value lenses are privileged over others and build capacity in decision-making for understanding and drawing on multiple value, epistemic and procedural lenses.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the recent wave of grassroots mobilizations opposing gender equality, LGBT rights and sex education, which vilify the term gender in public debates and policy document. The anti-gender movement emerged simultaneously in various locations after 2010. We argue that it is not just another wave of anti-feminist backlash, or a new tactic of the Vatican in its ongoing efforts to undermine gender equality, but a new ideological and political configuration, which emerged in response to global economic crisis of 2008 and the ongoing crisis of liberal democracy. The backlash of the 80s and 90s combined neo-conservatism with market fundamentalism (which is to some extent still the case with neoconservative Christian fundamentalists in the US and elsewhere), while the new movement \u2013 though in many ways a continuation of earlier trends \u2013 tends to combine gender conservatism with a critique of neoliberalism and globalization. Liberal elites are presented as \u201ccolonizers\u201d; \u201cgenderism\u201d is demonized as an ideology imposed by the world\u2019s rich on the poor. Thanks to the anti-colonial frame, anti-genderism has remarkable ideological coherence and great mobilizing power: right-wing populists have captured the imagination and hearts of large portions of local populations more effectively than progressive movements have managed to do. The article examines the basic tenets of anti-genderism, shedding light on how this ideological construct contributes to the contemporary transnational resurgence of illiberal populism. We argue that today\u2019s global right, while selectively borrowing from liberal-left and feminist discourses, is in fact constructing a new universalism, an illiberal one. While the examples discussed are mostly from Poland, the pattern is transnational, and our conclusions may have serious implications for feminist theory and activism.",
