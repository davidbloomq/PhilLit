      "abstract": "\n In the current context, strong constitutionalism is further challenged by the objections to judicial review and the deliberative turn of democracy. Despite the potential of both caveats, the problem is that a juricentric and juristocratic constitutionalism has globally expanded. The paper\u2019s argument is that there is an inconsistency in some theories that\u2014at the democratic level\u2014start from a deliberative conception, but\u2014at the constitutional level\u2014defend such a strong model, which hinders the inclusive dialogue ideal. This is the case of those conceptions of courts as an \u201cexemplar of public reason\u201d (Rawls), a \u201cforum of principles\u201d (Dworkin), or an \u201cargumentative representation institution\u201d (Alexy). To support this argument, the paper is structured as follows. First, it presents the indifference of the predominant constitutional culture to the criticisms of the judicial authority of strong constitutionalism, as well as to the deliberative turn of democracy. Then, it makes explicit the inconsistency of a group of theories which, while subscribing to a deliberative conception of democracy, subscribe to a strong model of constitutionalism. Finally, it argues that, in a context in which the objections to the judicial review and the deliberative turn of democracy have not been taken seriously, it is essential to reinforce both caveats to achieve a better constitutional model.",

After his turn to political liberalism, he was chary about claims of truth. In Section 1, I lay out essential features of Rawlsian deliberative democracy.

In Section 5, I argue that Rawls does not endorse the theses imputed to him by the non-permissive reading and that his view does not have the implications surveyed in Section 3.",

      "abstract": "Public reason is central to John Rawls\u2019s political liberalism, as a mechanism for citizens to discuss about matters of common interest. Although free and equal, reasonable and rational, citizens of a democratic society disagree on their understanding of truth and right, giving rise to the fact of reasonable pluralism. Thus, Rawls works out an idea of public reason which allows citizens to argue about political matters and yet remaining divided in their comprehensive doctrines. On the other hand, African culture has developed the practice of palaver as way of dealing with social and political questions of the community. Usually held under a tree, scholars believe that the palaver is the African version of deliberative democracy. In this article, I elaborate the two ideas and compare them in order to see whether they are completely opposite or whether they can enrich each other. Thus, the first section focuses on Rawls\u2019s idea of public reason, the second explores the palaver practice and the last section compares them.",

The thesis of this article is that, if an account of political virtue is a necessary element in a reasonable political conception, then so too is an account of political vice. The political vices are those attitudes, feelings, and dispositions that systematically work against reasonableness or the other cooperative or discursive goals of political virtue. The article concentrates on several epistemic-political vices along with practical-political vices that have epistemic elements. Epistemic-political vices such as close-mindedness or gullibility are especially worrisome in the digital age, given their tendency to undermine practices of public reasoning and deliberative democracy. Each political vice is understood as a characteristic failure of one of the Rawlsian burdens of judgment. Each is in this way a more specific form of unreasonableness.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The notion of moral exemplarity, though repeatedly alluded to in John Stuart Mill\u2019s writings, is rarely treated as an essential element of his democratic theory. This article, however, highlights and explains the centrality of exemplarity in Mill\u2019s project of fostering public-minded citizens for a successful democracy. In Representative Government, Mill conceives the exemplary influence of deliberative elites as a necessary condition for making local deliberative bodies the main site for the cultivation of a public spirit. Mill\u2019s Romantic reading of Plato\u2019s Gorgias suggests that this move resulted from his radical skepticism about the power of reason to motivate virtuous behavior along with his corresponding faith in the moral exemplar\u2019s aesthetic force of beauty to improve the spectator\u2019s conduct. Mill\u2019s emphasis on the necessity of exemplary influence for achieving a civic ideal based on a detailed account of its moral psychology reveals him to be a unique political thinker who continues to invite contemporary interest.",

      "abstract": "The decline of democracy in the US entails the surge of authoritarianism, ascendency of demagoguery, dispersal of the democratic majority, and weakening of public reason. Dissent, envisioned as a rhetorical practice of democratic deliberation, resists authoritarianism by advancing democratic values. Accordingly, this paper examines democracy as a minority voice, explores the deliberative capacity of dissent, and identifies the rhetorical properties of deliberation. The paper argues that dissent, in its fugitive aspect, is dispersed across an array of modest sites, guided by a deliberative ideal partially realised, and framed by democratic values. Dissent functions in this capacity as an itinerant, recurring source of democratic renewal on occasions of political crisis. It is an adaptation to structural constraints that provides a nurturing aspiration to prompt political agency, establish realistic expectations, and sustain vigilance. While the immediacy of the authoritarian threat and corresponding questions about the role of democratic communication are addressed in terms of the 2024 general election in the US, the democratic challenge in the US is indicative of the abiding immediacy of the authoritarian threat to other democracies and suggestive of deliberative adaptations for restoring the vitality of democratic communication and culture. Complacency in democratic theory and practice is counter-indicated.",

For this reason, the meaning and value of democracy are always closely linked. Popular theories of democracy, however, have only treated democracy as instrumentally valuable \u2013 merely some disposable means towards achieving and solving problems of justice, freedom, equality, etc. This has called into question the usefulness of having democracy in the first place. My aim is to show that deliberation should be taken into account in ethical analyses of democracy. Thus, I demonstrate that the concept of deliberative democracy is ethically relevant \u2013 i.e., deserves moral consideration, enables us to treat democracy as inherently valuable (or something close to it), and subsequently preserves the value of democracy both in our political and moral theorising and in our ordinary dealings.",

And yet when it comes to philosophizing they often turn a blind eye to what people think; they sometimes even express profound doubts about what people think and about consulting the public. I call this the political philosophy gap. It has been justified in several ways. In this paper I first consider and dismiss the most common justifications. I then suggest a democratic and an epistemological reason why political philosophers should consider what people think when they formulate their theories. I put forward a proposal for a method of doing so, which I call public reflective equilibrium, and which consists of four stages of research and philosophy. Finally, I suggest that not only is it doable, but it has a potential to contribute a lot to contemporary political philosophy.

In this article, I distinguish the concepts of lies, bullshit, and propaganda. I argue that the post-factual displays elements of all three concepts, so that it can be either understood to be in continuity with using lies and bullshit as means of political discourse; or to discontinue the basic commitments of democracy by attacking the epistemic foundations. In a second step, I argue that the common orientation towards the ideal of public reason cannot be abandoned at will, so that any Post-truth Politics is bound to fail in the end. I defend a concept of deliberative democracy which has a robust understanding of the rationality of democratic deliberation. At the same time, I argue against the assumption that the solution to \u2018post-factualism\u2019 is a return to a fictitious \u2018Age of Facts\u2019 since there are not facts without interpretation.",

      "abstract": "reference to deliberative democracy, but the depth of reflection offered by, say, epistemic democracy is not given here beyond an insistence on the \u201caffect.\u201d Yet in a period of hyperpolarization is the \u201caffect\u201d truly the way forward? Of course, there is a long tradition\u2014absent here\u2014stretching back to Mandeville\u2019s Fable of the Bees in which the pursuit of private vice is what leads to public virtue. Ultimately it is the figure of Dewey who stands behind the notion of \u201cdemocratic subjectivity,\u201d but how we might bring his \u201cpublics\u201d back to life is not something that the book addresses in any detail. As Son himself readily admits, his cast of characters\u2014 Schumpeter, Dahl, Easton, Hayek, and Arendt\u2014are quite \u201ceclectic\u201d (p. 13), and there is reason to question the influence they wielded on one another. Did cybernetics influence Schumpeter\u2019s and Dahl\u2019s theories of democracy? Dahl certainly seemed concerned about stability in the system, but Schumpeter famously rejected the Lausanne School of Economics\u2019 focus on equilibrium, preferring to speak about competition for markets instead of competition within markets. Son is entirely right to point out that the type of neoliberalism theorized by Wendy Brown leaves one with a sense of \u201cexhaustion and despair\u201d (p. 10), but the merit of that analysis is to show how neoliberalism attempts to be all-encompassing, extending economic rationality to all aspects of life. As Thatcher once put it, \u201cEconomics are the method: the object is to change the soul.\u201d With Dahl\u2014who was in favor of workplace democracy\u2014and Schumpeter we have different economic theories marrying with converging democratic theories, but with no clear sense of how their democratic theories were consciously reforming individual subjectivity, in the manner that neoliberalism and indeed cybernetics tried to. In chapter 5 on Hayek and Cold War neoliberalism, Son\u2014echoing work done by, among others, Quinn Slobodian\u2019s Globalists\u2014shows how Hayek was in fact much more favorable to authoritarian regimes than to democracy as means to discipline modern economic man and preserve the economy. But he writes, \u201cThe resemblance between the democratic society Truman depicted [the New Deal] and the neoliberal civilization Hayek envisions is striking\u201d (p. 134), later concluding that \u201cdespite the marginality of neoliberal economic policies, the postwar era brought American democracy remarkably close to the neoliberal social order envisioned byHayek\u201d (pp. 143\u201344). Son claims his book combines the \u201chistory of ideas and normative political theory\u201d (p. 12), but it is doubtful whether \u201cresemblance\u201d meets the criteria of influence that intellectual history would require. Nor is it clear, as the final chapter on Arendt tries to make out, that it was to totalitarianism that \u201cinstrumental democracy\u201d was responding: both Schumpeter and Dahl were responding to the rise of socialism, but in different ways. \u201cFear of the masses\u201d certainly haunted the development of postwar democratic theory, and Son is correct to point out that although that fear was long-standing, stretching at least back to the American founding and Plato himself, the Cold War was the first moment when it was integrated into a democratic theory rather than rejected. But what both Schumpeter and Dahl were responding to was the \u201celite\u201d theory of Mosca, Pareto, and Michels. Son closes his book with a call to \u201ccreate institutionalized space in which citizens are actually tasked with the responsibility of discussion and addressing their collective problems\u201d (p. 181).What that might actually look like Son does not say, and the reader may be left wondering whether this is first and foremost an \u201cethical\u201d project, free to take place within the confines of instrumental democracy. But if Dewey remains the reference point, then perhaps C. Wright Mills\u2019s \u201cradical ambition\u201d of developing a \u201cparticipatory democracy\u201d that integrates elite rule, hinted at in the conclusion, is a good place to start. In identifying the transformation of postwar democratic theory, Son has taken an important step in that direction.",

Instead, I suggest that, on one hand, deliberative democracy and J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 idea of democracy as truth-tracking offer a more helpful framework for assessing and combating the threat of fake news and, on the other hand, Bernard Williams\u2019 virtues of accuracy identify the citizen virtues necessary to counteract fake news. The virtues of accuracy, I contend, can be facilitated and encouraged through structural and regulatory features in the public sphere. We are indeed seeing a recalibration and significant push back on fake news due to both structural changes and ordinary citizens becoming more epistemically responsible consumers of digital information.",
