      "abstract": "This essay creates an unlikely conversation between two 20th century thinkers: John Rawls and Michael Oakeshott. I say \u201cunlikely\u201d because apart from a few scant remarks in the writing of each the two did not directly engage each other. The essay begins by examining Oakeshott\u2019s explication of \u201cThe Rationalist\u201d and her tradition in the history of political thought. Specifically, the essay shows that rationalism in politics involves the belief that reason is an infallible guide to political activity and that the Rationalist seeks certainty and perfection in political affairs. The essay goes on to tease out the rationalistic tendencies in Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice, and then it analyzes Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and applies these criticisms to Rawls. Briefly, Oakeshott marks a distinction between technical and practical knowledge, and he argues that the principles that make up technical manuals like A Theory of Justice are abridgments of and no substitute for the understanding we gain through our practical experience and our participation in a given political tradition. While explaining Oakeshott\u2019s critique of rationalism and Rawls, the essay indicates some of the relativistic proclivities in Oakeshott\u2019s appeal to political practices and traditions, and then it entertains objections to Oakeshott that a Rawlsian might offer. Here Rawls\u2019 commitment to the liberal tradition and the relativity implicit in his explanations of \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d are examined and Rawls\u2019 similarities to Oakeshott are noted. Ultimately, this essay argues that the strength of Rawls\u2019 work lay not in the fact that his principles of justice are established by rational agents in an original position, but in the fact that they are principles that emerge from and cohere with ideas deeply rooted in the Western tradition itself.",

      "abstract": "The (core) competency-based education theory presented through the OECD\u2019s DeSeCo project and its follow-up project (OECD Education 2030), stems from the motivation to pay appropriate attention to practical knowledge beyond cultivating theoretical knowledge that has been traditionally emphasized. The main theoretical sources constituting the epistemology of competency-based education theory can be presented as follows: analytical philosopher Gilbert Ryle's distinction between \u2018know-how\u2019 and \u2018know-that\u2019, political scientist Michael Oakshott's criticism of technological rationalism and his distinction between the politics of faith and that of skepticism, and physical chemist, historian of science, and philosopher of science Michael Polanyi's concepts of tacit knowledge and personal knowledge. However, discrepancy between what the OECD's competency-based education theory originally intended and its actual realization is first found in the program of the OECD projects itself; and this problem is much more seriously revealed in the process and appearance of introducing and applying competency-based education theory into the Korean higher education system. This self-contradiction that \u2018betrays\u2019 the original theoretical request of competency-based education theory is identified in the following areas: the OECD projects\u2019 reduction of competences as \u2018know-how\u2019 to the form of propositional knowledge, in the situation in Korea, in the state's status that claims to be a rule maker, in the future discourse based on simple logic of technological determinism, and in the making of propositions and the quantification of competencies. Such problems are resolved by abolishing measures of forcibly introducing and applying a specific educational discourse by the state, and making the competency-based education theory a subject of free choice through deliberation at individual educational units.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of the study was to provide knowledge on the epistemological schools of thoughts that most appropriately suits risk management research. The researcher then laid out the steps involved in managing risk, like identifying potential dangers, analyzing how likely the researcher are, figuring out how to control them, and then checking how well your plan worked. Next, the researcher looked at specific schools of thought like naturalism (focusing on the physical world), rationalism (using logic and reason), empiricism (based on evidence), idealism (emphasizing ideas), and existentialism (individual experience). By comparing these schools, the researcher showed how each has its strengths and weaknesses. The key takeaway? Don't just stick to one way of thinking about risk! Mix and match different approaches depending on the situation. This will help practitioners and researchers to make risk management research more reliable, accurate, and widely accepted. So, in a nutshell, this research is like a guide for choosing the right tools to navigate the tricky terrain of risk. By understanding different ways of knowing and using them strategically, practitioners and researchers can make better decisions and avoid getting caught off guard.\nReferences\nAsif, M., Pasha, M.
