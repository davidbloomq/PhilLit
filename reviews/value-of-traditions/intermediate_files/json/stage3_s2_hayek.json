      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Spontaneous order literature (\u201cTradition of Spontaneous Order\u201d (1982) by Norman Barry; The Scottish Enlightenment and the Theory of Spontaneous Order (1987) by Ronald Hamowy; \"Spontaneous Order\" (1989) by Robert Sugden; \"The Theory of Spontaneous Order and Cultural Evolution in the Social Theory of F.A. Hayek\" (1990) by Peter J. Boettke; Calculation and Coordination: Essays on Socialism and Transitional Political Economy (2001) by Peter J. Boettke; Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment (2001) by Christina Petsoulas; \"The Origin and Scope of Hayek\u2019s Idea of Spontaneous Order\" (2007) by Louis Hunt; \"Spontaneous Order\" (2015) by Daniel J. D'Amico; \"Spontaneous Economic Order\" (2016) by Yong Tao) has long downplayed the ideas of Michael Polanyi. When attempts were being made to change this attitude (\"Polanyi on Liberal Neutrality\" (1996/97) by C. P. Goodman; \"Michael Polanyi and Spontaneous Order, 1941-1951\" (1997) by Struan Jacobs), they mostly suggested to replace Hayek with Polanyi as the key figure who recoined the concept for the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, scholars of Austrian economics jumped into the arena of competing priority claims (\"Against Polanyi-Centrism: Hayek and the Re-Emergence of \u201cSpontaneous Order\u201d\" (2005) by John P. Bladel) and claimed that Hayek, von Mises and R\u00f6pke have argued for such an order long before Polanyi\u2019s first writing using this terminology was published in 1948. Only a few accounts attempted to present some kind of balance in this respect (Adam Smith's Political Philosophy: The Invisible Hand and Spontaneous Order (2006) by Craig Smith; The Collected Works of F.A. Hayek, Volume 15: The Market and Other Orders (2014) by Bruce Caldwell; \"Friedrich Hayek and Michael Polanyi in Correspondence\" (2016) by Struan Jacobs and Phil Mullins; The Architecture of Neoliberalism: How Contemporary Architecture Became an Instrument of Control and Compliance (2016) by Douglas Spencer; \"Editorial Introduction to \u2018Collectivist Planning\u2019 by Michael Polanyi (1940)\" (2019) by Geoffrey M. Hodgson). This paper aims to explore the so far untold characteristics of Polanyi\u2019s spontaneous order theory through analysing archival materials and doing so offers a reason for reconsidering what we have to know about the history of spontaneous order theory. And this reconsideration might lead to developing new, more fine-grained and viable theories of spontaneous order, including those that can treat claims of spontaneous order and claims of social justice not as incompatible but as compatible aims in ordering social affairs. This perspective should, no doubt, come in handy in our increasingly polarized societies at the beginning of the twenty-first century.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous orders are an essential concept in political theory and political economy. Such orders entail the impossibility of predicting outcomes in detail and hence controlling and directing social processes. Many phenomena characterizing contemporary societies can be depicted as spontaneous orders, from the housing and financial markets to the evolution of norms and trends. Yet, it is well known that not every spontaneous order is beneficial. Therefore, what form of political framework is compatible with recognizing such orders? In this article, I address this problem through the example of the work of Friedrich Hayek, a prominent liberal theorist of spontaneous orders. His work shows the necessity to theorize a government of spontaneous orders based on maximizing reasonable expectations and individual freedom. I finally emphasize what such a theory implies for political power, which is not abolished but should handle complexity appropriately.",

      "abstract": "Aim. To analyze the concept of \u201cspontaneous orders\u201d in substantiation of individualistic freedom by Austro-British philosopher Friedrich August von Hayek (1899\u20131992). Based on the material of his key political and legal writings \"The Road to Serfdom\u201d, \u201cConstitution of Freedom\u201d, \u201cLaw, Legislation and Freedom\u201d and several articles, an analysis of the reasons for the philosopher\u2019s use of individualism as a methodological setting for the study of social processes was given.Methodology. The analysis of the concept of \u201cspontaneous order\u201d was carried out within the framework of content analysis and historical-system method.Results. It is shown that there are different ideas about liberalism in political discourse, which is given the common label \u201cneoliberalism\u201d. The main feature of Hayek\u2019s version of liberal ideology was the denial of universal ways of reforming the state apparatus. His analysis also contains the refusal to merge the legislative and executive powers in one administrative body of power. This thesis shows that no authority can have absolute power, as it is incapable of possessing the totality of knowledge that is in society. The article demonstrates the dependence of abstract general rights and laws on perceptions in the form of habits of individuals based on the past.Research implications. A key feature of the concept of \u201cspontaneous order\u201d by F. A. Hayek in contrast to other representatives of \u201cneoliberal discourse\u201d has been revealed.",

      "abstract": "This paper evaluates and compares the main philosophic and economic thoughts of the two great liberal minds Michael Polanyi and Friedrich A. von Hayek in regards to the concept of a \u2018spontaneous order\u2019. In several of their books and papers, both Michal Polanyi (1941, 1948, 1951) and F.A. von Hayek (1944, 1945, 1964, 1973) strongly emphasised on the impossibility of socialism and the superiority of a free market versus public interventionism. Both highlighted their conviction that central planning cannot be more efficient than a spontaneous order, since knowledge is dispersed (Hayek) and tacit (Polanyi). Although both shared very similar concerns in regards to economic matters, they did not always come to the same conclusions. Thus, also the differences between Polanyi\u2019s and Hayek\u2019s concepts will be discussed, such as Polanyi\u2019s emphasis on defending subsystems as the basic units of society, and his focus on maximizing \u201cpublic freedom\u201d. Both came to different conclusions in regards to the institutional character of science, and even concluded somewhat differently on the character of knowledge. Most importantly, they developed different concepts on political economy and the ideal role of the State. Moreover, this paper will consider the impact of M. Polanyi on the concept of polycentricity and on the ideas of Elinor Ostrom, while also referring to the different understanding of the role of the State in the ideas of F.A. Hayek compared to other Austrian School economists, such as Murray N. Rothbard. In addition, the paper pretends to historically analyse the emergence of the term \u2018spontaneous order\u2019, showing that it is not the product of one mind\u2019s design, but the consequence of the thoughts of several great minds, such as Carl Menger, Ludwig * Patrick Reimers, MBA and Master in Austrian School Economics. Patrick is also holding an M.A. in Philosophy (Maestr\u00eda en Filosof\u00eda) from Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn (UFM) and is currently a Ph.D. student at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Doctorando en Ciencias Sociales y Jur\u00eddicas).",

      "abstract": "Friedrich Hayek\u2019s The Use of Knowledge in Society presents a seminal argument for the virtues of decentralized knowledge and the price mechanism, positing that markets, by leveraging dispersed, context-specific knowledge, can achieve efficient resource coordination without central oversight. Hayek\u2019s work has deeply influenced economic thought, particularly in its defence of spontaneous order and its critique of central planning. However, Hayek\u2019s framework, developed in a pre-digital and less interconnected economic landscape, reveals limitations when confronted with today\u2019s challenges, such as digital monopolies, ecological degradation, and economic inequality. This article critically examines Hayek\u2019s theoretical positions, revealing inconsistencies and limitations when applied to the complexities of modern global economies. The article then presents an evolved framework\u2014the Ethically Resilient Market Theory (ERMT)\u2014which builds upon Hayek\u2019s insights, incorporating principles of ethical accountability, ecological valuation, and resilience to address the ethical and practical demands of contemporary economic life.",

I argue that they offer significantly different but complementary visions of the value of the market as a system of individual freedom. Hayek's vision is of the price system as a marvel of spontaneous order which solves a fundamental economic problem \u2013 that of making efficient use of a totality of knowledge that is divided between individuals. Buchanan's vision is of the market as a space in which individuals are free to make voluntary exchanges. In his words, \u2018this is all that there is to it\u2019: the market is not a solution to any collective problem. These visions have a common blind spot. Both writers recognise the need for programmes of social insurance and consider how they should structured so as to be as compatible as possible with the workings of a market economy and a liberal democracy. But, I argue, neither sees the full importance of social insurance in a justification of the market system.",

Hayek\u2019s notion of freedom is multifaceted, encompassing political freedom as the absence of arbitrary coercion, economic freedom as the effective use of dispersed knowledge through market mechanisms, and scientific freedom as the recognition of subjective knowledge and the limits of central planning. The study is divided into three sections: an introduction, a detailed analysis of freedom in Hayek\u2019s works, and a conclusion. By analyzing key texts such as The Road to Serfdom (1944), Individualism and Economic Order (1948), The Constitution of Liberty (1960), Law, Legislation and Liberty (1978), and The Fatal Conceit (1991), the paper highlights Hayek's preference for spontaneous orders over constructed ones, his critique of centralization, and his advocacy for the rule of law as essential for individual liberty and societal progress. Ultimately, Hayek\u2019s comprehensive analysis underscores the critical role of freedom in fostering a free and prosperous society, emphasizing the superiority of decentralized processes and market mechanisms in promoting social progress and innovation.",

      "abstract": "The article is devoted to the question of the correlation between the formation of philosophical methodology in the modern era and the problematization of tradition in the humanities. The authors believe that the theme of tradition was one of the starting points for the development of humanitarian knowledge and, at the same time, contributed to the methodological expansion of philosophical research. Already at the end of the 18th century, romantics, fascinated by antiquity, made attempts to rationalize the emergence of religious texts from the Middle Ages. Their predominant interest in history led to the assumption that any form of knowledge can be rationally reconstructed. However, in order to do this it was necessary to expand the factual account of each of the studied phenomena. The romantics thereby largely anticipated the research intentions of classical positivism, without turning away from the defining role of intellectual intuition, which grasps the experimental content of consciousness with a concept. All humanitarian knowledge (history, psychology, linguistics) from the second half of the 19th century developed in this direction. The authors pay special attention to W.Dilthey\u2019s interest in the topic of tradition and the congeniality of philosophical hermeneutics and the late phenomenology of E.Husserl. Further, the role of phenomenology and hermeneutics in the development of historical methodology is analyzed on the example of the Annales school, and then the role of the latter in the origin and development of structuralism. In conclusion, the authors hypothesize that the philosophical traditionalism of R.Guenon and his followers, declaring their rejection of New European rationalism, reproduces the general methodological model of the era and anticipates postmodern intellectuals.",

The aim of this work is also to analyze a set of rules in general, because the rules of human behavior stopped in Hayek's idea produced equally significant position as the order. In this context, it wants the text to highlight the causal connection of order with the rules, which built so to prevent chaos in society and maintaining its functional progress. The intention of this paper is through the order and rules, as two general as well as probably the most important pillars of Hayek's ideological concept to highlight their importance as indicators of the minimal efforts to define the scope of freedom.",

Hayek seeks to understand how human action and coordination among individuals occur in an environment where the knowledge held by each person is incomplete and not fully transmittable. In such an environment, the institutional framework plays an important role in conditioning, at least partially, the behavior of members within a spontaneously emerging social order. In light of this, the objective of this article is to present Hayek\u2019s evolutionary institutional approach by organizing the discussion proposed by the Austrian economist on the subject. To do so, it will discuss Hayek\u2019s distinction between critical rationalism and constructivist rationalism. It will also address Hayek\u2019s explanation of institutional change and delve into his evolutionary approach to the social sciences, as opposed to the natural sciences.",

The praxeological assessment of philosophical knowledge is considered. The purpose of the article is to draw attention to the increasing role of practical and applied ethical knowledge in all spheres of human life and activity on the basis of philosophical discourses in order to affirm the author\u2019s idea of the value and importance of practical ethics in the structure of philosophical knowledge. In this connection, the analysis of the problem of conceptualization of the concepts of applied ethics and practical ethics is carried out.\n\nThe author traces the origins of the concept, starting with ancient ethics, which, according to Aristotle, has a dual character; it acts both as a theoretical and as a practical discipline aimed at the formation of virtuous behavior. The contribution of I. Kant is emphasized, who linked morality with the autonomy of the will and freedom, which consolidated ethics as the core of practical philosophy.\n\nThe focus is on modern interpretations of practical and applied ethics in relation to theoretical philosophical knowledge. The positions of leading Russian philosophers are analyzed, discussing the differences between theoretical ethics, which studies abstract moral principles, and applied ethics, which focuses on solving specific moral dilemmas in professional and social contexts. Special attention is paid to the role of ethics in the context of global challenges: the author considers it as a tool for the formation of responsible behavior, civic responsibility and professional competence aimed at serving the benefit of society, individual communities and citizens in accordance with the specifics of their professional activities. intercultural dialogue and protection of human dignity.\n\nThe article highlights the increasing importance of practice-oriented ethical knowledge in education and professional activities, as well as its potential to overcome modern crises. It is concluded that practical philosophy, while maintaining its connection with the ancient Kantian tradition, evolves in response to the demands of society, integrating ethical principles into various spheres of human practice and contributing to sustainable development.",

It appears that a genuine explanation must be able to answer the following questions: how are peo\u00adple able to comprehend complex phenomena of the social world (such as institutions) that are not related to the reality of physical bodies; how can each individual possess knowl\u00adedge of a potentially unlimited set of social situations, involving a potentially unlimited number of rules for building social relations; and how is the universality of institutions combined with their cultural and situational variability. Similar questions have been raised in linguistics within the framework of universal grammar and some internalist ap\u00adproaches to language and thought. Within the sociological tradition, externalist interpreta\u00adtions of the nature of social reality and the phenomenon of social order have historically prevailed. However, the arguments previously proposed in favor of an innate language faculty also seem legitimate in relation to the human ability to process and represent so\u00adcial information \u2013 namely, institutional thinking. Intuitive knowledge of the system of so\u00adcial world rules (knowledge of society) requires solving the \u201cPlato\u2019s problem\u201d: con\u00adstructing models of perception and learning (processing and representation of social information). From the author\u2019s point of view, the assumption of \u201cmental tools\u201d could ex\u00adplain how all participants in interaction grasp the common logic of constructing institu\u00adtional forms.",

The problematic status of this text, which combines artistic and conceptual elements, makes the research tradition return to this work of Nietzsche in search of new ways of interpretation. We focus on the discursive approach in relation to Zarathustra, within the framework of which the main objects of consideration are the parameters of speech and knowledge of the central Nietzschean character. The paper demonstrates the connection between the discursive figure of God and the figure of Zarathustra. In various contexts within the very work under consideration and also in his related texts, Nietzsche shows that the prophetic status of the protagonist cannot be determined on the basis of the idea of expected revelation, i.e. unity of knowledge. Unlike the divine position, seeking to establish certain unity of meaning, the discursive position of Zarathustra requires the preservation of ambiguity. In order to propose a description of such a mode of speech, which could express ambiguity but at the same time produce some knowledge, we addressed the discursive figure of laughter in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. This figure appears in the text precisely in those moments when Zarathustra exposes some kind of knowledge or, crucially, is exposed himself. Laughter acts as a marker of situations in which Zarathustra as a prophet approaches the knowledge he seeks, but stops at the very edge of the disclosure of meaning. Based on the obtained description of the discursive position of the main character of the work, we put forward the assumption that the interpretation of the text requires not the interpretation of the content of the text, but first of all the interpretation of its experimental form.",

This seems incompatible with the God of Christian revelation, who is the source of love and mercy. Current attempts to explain this tension usually focus on two approaches: the \u2018gift of freedom\u2019 (McLeish) or the \u2018only way\u2019 theory (Southgate). I will argue that Thomas Aquinas\u2019 understanding of nature is able to provide an interesting framework for the challenges posed by the way of the appearance of life. The article will present Aquinas\u2019 theology of nature, which seems to fit perfectly with the current state of scientific knowledge, especially when considering the relationship between God and creation.Contribution: The article shows that the problem of the interpretation of paradise in the Christian tradition may be related to the influence of the Neoplatonic tradition, which reduces paradise to the idealistic sphere. Attention is drawn to the concept of perfection, which does not mean the absence of any disvalue in the natural world, but is a relational concept. The death of animals and natural evil need not be explained by moral evil, but requires a broader interpretation of the value of the natural order.",

This paper argues that the project of the Islamization of Knowledge (IoK) has overlooked the role of a neoliberal politicoeconomic order in the knowledge production along with the relation between knowledge and the market established by economic liberalization. So the resulting discourse perhaps inadequately explains the incapacity of contemporary application of Islamic economics and finance to provide a viable alternative to western economic systems, let alone solve socioeconomic problems in Muslim countries. This paper will attempt to cover this inadequacy by explaining the relation between mind, knowledge and market as theorized by Hayek, along with Foucault\u2019s perspective power-knowledge nexus. The Hayek\u2019s and Foucault\u2019s perspective on the relation between state, market, mind and knowledge creates an interesting challenge for IoK because it is not only the issue of reconciliation of the spheres of knowledge, rather free unhampered flow of market is also presumably necessary for the growth of human mind and consequently human knowledge as argued by Hayek and Foucault. The neoliberal-state allows free unhampered flow of the market, subsequently creating knowledge in pursuit of continuous capital accumulation. Production of knowledge, therefore, becomes a mechanism to maintain the hegemony of the neoliberal-state and market, while establishing authority of capital on ontological position of man and society. In this context any intervention in the process of IoK under religious obligation is not just an epistemological, rather a moral impossibility within capitalist discourse. The relationship between the neoliberal-state, market and production of knowledge will enable the scholars of Islamic economics and finance to reassess their strategies pertaining to IoK.",

The relationship between tradition and innovation has been the subject of cultural and philosophical discussions for centuries. One way to understand the relationship between tradition and innovation is to consider them as opposing forces. According to this view, tradition refers to the values, beliefs and practices passed down from generation to generation, while innovation refers to the pursuit of progress, change and innovation. Proponents of this view believe that tradition can stifle progress and creation, and innovation can lead to the loss of cultural heritage. In the article, the study of tradition and innovation in culture was carried out through various methods. A historical analysis was carried out. This method made it possible to study the history of philosophical thought in order to understand the tradition and development of certain schools or ideas. A review of existing works on the subject was made to gain a deeper understanding of tradition and innovations in culture and to identify gaps in current knowledge. To determine how cultural factors influence innovation, cultural traditions and practices in society were compared.",

In analysing the necessary presuppositions and to see which tradition best coheres with the web of embodied beliefs, I also aim to unite Philosophical terminology and principles with that of Theology. In order to circumvent the problem of circularity, I want to avoid Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (a Sanskrit word that connotes \u2018wandering\u2019 and also \u2018world\u2019, wherein the term connotes \u2018cyclic change\u2019) through the correct Pramana (Knowledge-Epistemology). This is taken to be found in the Purusha and also grasped within the Logos (a concept word symbolic of the nature and purpose of Jesus Christ). We appreciate in this paper that both Hinduism(s) and Christianity accept Divine Revelation and the Universal Mind as the basis for Knowledge.",

      "abstract": "In the article I demonstrate the value of philosophical research in science by the example of verification of conditions of using mathematics. In recent years, scientists in expert systems often use philosophical concepts, in particular the notion \u201ccausal relation\u201d for introducing probabilistic independency, as the mathematical description of independency is not so constructive; therefore, verification of independency in data is a hard problem. Thus, by using philosophical notions in science, analytic philosophers have good chances to participate in multidisciplinary research, as non-philosophers do not commonly have wide and deep knowledge of philosophy. I draw on the example of the famous mathematician Shafer, who used a special version of causal relation to describe independency in his conception of a general probabilistic interpretation. The famous philosopher Cartwright raised a natural question about the adequacy of this interpretation for analyzing other causal relations. I offer another example of usefulness of philosophical analysis for verifying the conditions of application of mathematics which is connected with statistical wars. Statistical wars are battles between representatives of different probability interpretations; in particular, history knows severe battles between representatives of frequency and subjective interpretations. The followers of frequency interpretation are empiricists, the empirical tradition requires a careful verification of conditions of application of the formal apparatus, but such tests are not necessary in the subjective tradition, this is why their critique of opponents is not solid. I used such argumentation in my article in order to show that the critique of Kolmogorov\u2019s conditions of using probability theory on the basis of Bernoulli theorem by subjectivists is not a serious one. Besides, for an analytic philosopher who knows mathematical methods and can use them, new prospects are opening up due to imperfections of mathematical methods. The point is that scientists try to avoid criticizing shortcomings in the methods in the absence of alternative approaches, so a philosopher receives the chance to participate in research as a critic of imperfections of formal methods in applications.",

The methodology of the research is an interdisciplinary synthesis of knowledge based on dialectics (H.\u00a0Hegel) and the general theory of systems (L.\u00a0von\u00a0Bertalanffy). Scientific novelty. For the first time, the author has analysed the problem of the completeness of the domestic terminology on environment creation to express original meanings according to the Cyrillic humanistic tradition, and specialisations of activity. It has been proposed to introduce into scientific circulation a general definition of a group of professional artistic directions for creating an environment for human life as a hierarchical environmental image creation, the purpose of which is the integral beauty of spatial forms. Conclusions. The content of the borrowed terminology requires a more careful selection, as it is intended to enrich the vocabulary and clarify relevant industry concepts and professional specialisations, in particular, according to international qualification definitions. However, lexical borrowings do not have sufficient potential for worldview, mental-cognitive compliance with the national linguistic environment. In order to ensure national philosophical goal setting, in accordance with the national Slavic-Greek-Latin tradition of a complete and true Living Word, we need, along with borrowed names and terminology, to use primarily national, including Old Slavic, vocabulary in quality of the main methodological one. The domestic humanistic tradition, the peculiarities of word formation and the lexical fund of the Ukrainian literary language make it possible to return to wider use the national name of the content and purpose of an artistic composition (leepota) and to introduce into scientific circulation the natural definition of object-spatial arts, namely \"environmental imagery\" as well as \u00abhierarchical environmental imagery\u00bb. \nKey words: architecture, harmony, design, Living Word, architectonics, architectonic urban development, composition, leepota, urban planning, creating the environment, terminology, philosophy of hierarchy of environment creation.",

      "abstract": "The research is aimed at the historical and philosophical reconstruction of the problems of Gaudiya Vedanta theory of knowledge related to philosophizing, the concept of revelation and qualification (adh\u012bk\u0101ra), in the philosophy of India of XVI\u2013XX centuries. Gaudiya Vedanta, the philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, is the last independent branch of Vedanta in Indian philosophy, which summarizes in its texts the problems and solutions of previous Vedanta movements in the XVI century. The specificity of this school lies in the emphasis on personalism, ethics and aesthetics. The approach of \u00abworld philosophy\u00bb (F. I. Shcherbatskoy, V. K. Shokhin, R. V. Pshu) was used for the study, according to which in the philosophy of each developed culture we can find similar philosophical problems in varying degrees of elaboration in connection with a unique historical situation. Based on this approach, a historical and philosophical reconstruction of the hermeneutics of Gaudiya Vedanta is carried out, in which philosophizing is considered as the result of the process of revelation. The historical and philosophical analysis allowed us to identify two stages of the formation of the concept of revelation (\u015babda, \u015b\u0101stra, sam\u0101dhi, veda) and qualification (adh\u012bk\u0101ra) in Gaudiya Vedanta: classical (Jiva Gosvami and Krishnadas Kaviraja, Visvanatha Chakravarti XVI\u2013XVII centuries), modern (Bhaktivinoda, Bhaktisiddhanta, Bhaktivedanta XIX\u2013XX centuries). The analysis of historiography shows that Gaudiya Vedanta, using the apparatus of new logic (navya-nyaya), entered the age of globalization and accepted the challenges not only of the existing tradition of Indian philosophy, but also of European philosophy. For this purpose, the school used a system of interpretation and receiving revelations both inside and outside the sacred sphere with an expanded understanding of revelation and sacredness. In addition, Gaudiya Vedanta formulated special requirements for a thinker working with revelation. These requirements were supposed to preserve the uniqueness of the school and ensure intellectual continuity. They imply the need for the philosopher to have both some academic qualification (theology of the first order): knowledge of texts, their logic of explanation, prudence and insight, and spiritual qualifications (theology of the second order): morality, detachment and, in particular, sensitivity to religious emotions in relation to God. The historical and philosophical reconstruction allowed us to explicate a special model of philosophizing of Gaudiya Vedanta, based on revelation, personalistic theology, ethics and aesthetics. The results of the research can be useful for historians of Eastern philosophy with new material, analysis of concepts, explication of the role of historical and philosophical contexts.",

The problem of leadership is a theme which runs through Achebe\u2019s trilogy namely, No Longer at Ease, Things Fall Apart and our present Text. In Arrow of God, Achebe decries the wane of both Igbo customs and traditions which followed the advent of colonialists and Christian missionaries into Africa. Ezeulu (who epitomizes Igbo customs and traditions) finds his traditional authority being challenged. This constituted an affront to the spirituality, social cohesion and stability of Igbo society. Even Ezeulu lost his life despite his ready receptivity of some pertinent ideological changes demanded by the times. The worrisome problem becomes: how could the reliable and stable Igbo worldview succumb to a divisive foreign epistemology? The battle of these two worldviews and cultures culminated in violence and death. Achebe condemns such violence and creates the need for a knowledge system that will engender societal development by harmonizing the positive elements of African and European worldviews. In order to bridge this epistemological gap, our study examines the notions of knowledge among the Igbos of Arrow of God, identifies their significances and proposes the idea of cultural integrativism as a panacea for cultural and ideological conflicts. The researcher adopted the analytical and hermeneutical methods of inquiry.",

The scope of work; It consists of 7th grade textbooks of Planet Publishing and 12th grade textbooks of G\u00fcn Publishing, which were prepared as a result of the curriculum created in 2018 and approved by the Ministry of Education Education and Discipline Board with the decision of 78 numbers on May 28, 2018. Likewise; Alevism and Bektashism are only covered in 7th and 12th grade DKAB textbooks. Our problem in the study is to evaluate the aspect of the content related to Alevism and Bektashism in the Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge curriculum. Alevism and Bektashism, in the 5th unit of the 7th grade Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge textbook and in the 3rd units of the 12th grade Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge textbook, under the title of Sufi Interpretations in Islamic Thought, he had a detailed knowledge area called \u201cAlevism and Bektashism\u201d. It has been brought together with students from many frameworks and a comprehensive content has been created. It is necessary to make the books a correct information content and to give the students the real information they will encounter in the society. For this reason, it becomes necessary to examine the information in the books.Examining how the concepts and subjects related to Alevism and Bektashism are handled in the books, understanding and explaining Alevism and Bektashism correctly reveals the importance of our study. The aim of our study is to investigate and evaluate which concepts or peoples belonging to Alevism and Bektashism are included in the Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge books. The main sources of our work; Religious Culture and Moral Education Curriculum (Primary School 4th, Secondary School 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Grades), Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge Curriculum (High School 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Grades), 7th and 12th Grades. class Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge textbooks. Qualitative approach and literature review method were used in our study. When we come to the conclusion of the study; The state, by addressing the members of the tradition, reflected their understanding in the curriculum. However, we could not find an expression that would include the characteristics of all the common acceptances in all groups evaluated under the roof of Alevism and Bektashism. Criticisms such as distorting the information given by using the main sources of this Alevi and Bektashi tradition, Buyruk and Maqalat, have been blocked. In addition, the concepts of Alevism and Bektashism were evaluated as 'same', their differences were not included, and this situation was not an accurate definition. It would be beneficial for the content of the subject to be researched more comprehensively by experts and for the Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge branch teachers to be subjected to seminars and trainings in order to be informed about the subject.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the construction and methodology of knowledge in the scope of Islamic Religious Education (PAI). This study explores five main aspects: (a) Sources of knowledge in Islamic Religious Education, (b) Scientific paradigms between revelation and reason, (c) Integrative research methodology in Islamic studies, (d) Deconstruction of the boundaries of scientific disciplines in Islamic Religious Education, and (e) Episteme of contemporary Islamic knowledge: between tradition and modernity. With this approach, Islamic Religious Education can continue to develop, be understood, and practiced in the life of society, so that a harmonious and orderly order of life is created. The study of concepts in the scope of Islamic Religious Education (PAI) must continue to be developed along with the emergence of complex problems amidst the development of globalization, as a basis for contemporary studies. This study is expected to be a reference for educators and education practitioners in developing more effective and relevant Islamic Religious Education (PAI) materials.",

      "abstract": "The article aims to validate the historical\u2011philosophical significance of Heinrich Rickert\u2019s considerations of several important themes present in the history of 20th\u2011century philosophy. This is achieved by interpreting selected excerpts from Rickert\u2019s argument \u2013 contained in his major work entitled Der Gegenstand der Erkenntnis (\u201cThe Object of Knowledge\u201d) \u2013 in order to critically expose and describe the problems and tensions presented there, as well as perspectives that make it possible to bring to light the hitherto unknown interpretations of the essential philosophical questions. The latter include, in the first place, issues that make up the triunity discovered by Parmenides \u2013 speech, thought, and being (fr. B 6). I call them collectively the fundamental subject\u2011matter of philosophy. The development of the Parmenidean idea of unity of speech, thought, and being in Rickert\u2019s philosophy is associated with a triple shift in research paradigms in relation to philosophical tradition, especially the pre\u2011critical one: firstly, the visible pronouncement of the sense and the role of non\u2011propositional utterances; secondly, the emphasized meaning of the epistemic action or performance (Leistung). The former leads ultimately to the undermining of the centuries\u2011old hegemony of judgement in logic and epistemology, whereas the latter challenges the traditional, passive\u2011contemplative understanding of knowledge. Thirdly, to this we must add Rickert\u2019s clear detachment from the traditional understanding of philosophy as a definitive, or perhaps just isolated, range of objects, conceptualised as a collection of something that exists, or even must exist in the positive sense \u2013 really or unreally. It seems that all the above\u2011mentioned \u201eshifts\u201d are crucial for contemporary thought.",

      "abstract": "Hannah Arendt is widely known as a philosopher who attempted to rehabilitate the ancient Greek conception of politics. According to established readings of\u00a0The Human Condition, Arendt is generally regarded as a \u2018Graecophile\u2019 whose thought is underwritten by \u2018Athenian nostalgia\u2019. Arendt\u2019s sympathies for the Greeks are hard to deny: she did indeed turn to the Athenian understanding of politics in an attempt to crystallise in it the core elements of authentic politics. However, this interpretation is excessively one-sided. In Arendt\u2019s view, the greatest contribution to the understanding of politics was offered by the Romans, not the Greeks. The Romans were much better at dealing with the problem of stability, continuity and order of politics. In Arendt\u2019s view, an exclusive focus on action, spontaneity and extraordinary deeds threatens to destabilise the life of the political community. By introducing concepts such as tradition, authority, the sacredness of foundation, the law (lex), as well as the political significance of promise and forgiveness, the Romans opened up a dimension of political sedimentation which was alien to the Greeks. Political sedimentation provides safeguards, without which a sustainable political existence would become impossible.",

      "abstract": "As a variant of Political Economy deriving from Adam Smith\u2019s Wealth of Nations(WN), Public Choice students need to add Theory of Moral Sentiment to recognize true meaning of Homo Economicus, which the discipline stands on. This article focuses on four points regarding this project. First, the meaning of Sympathy by Smith was extracted from TMS. Second, logic of Smith\u2019s Justice theory were analyzed, Third, some persuasive explanations were tried to solve so-called \u2018Das Adam Smith Problem\u2019 between TMS and WN. Fourth, relations of TMS to Public Choice was suggested, in the context of both concord and discord. Results of this article reveal some implications as follows. First, Smithian TMS logic emerged without any transcendental components like absolute reason or revelation by god, which serves to more acceptability to ordinary individuals. Second, \u2018Impartial Spectator\u2019 plays vital role to induce more objective judgements from subjective judgements of any individuals. Without it, moral sentiments are not to form mutual sympathy. Third, situations is restricted in which sympathy can lead to social stability. Therefore, force by politics, institutions, and law is more common where sympathy is hard to emerge. Public Choice is a set of knowledge to deal with those situations(\u2018organizational order\u2019, by Hayek) lacking sympathy. Fourth, even so, organizational order requires to secure sympathy of the individuals being governed, at least in long-term basis, suggesting sympathy is still important, both in the world of spontaneous and organizational order.",

Then he presents the six groups of motives distinguished by Engel and Hartwig, which may lead to the phenomenon of deliberate ignorance. The author proposes to reduce The author proposes to reduce this taxonomy to three more general motives, i.e. emotional, pragmatic and moral category, and characterizes their specificity. Referring to psychoanalytic tradition and the role attributed by the modern experimental psychology to unconscious processes, he notes that not every type of motivated ignorance is preceded by a \u201cdeliberate\u201d, conscious decision. Many manifestations of ignorance are spontaneous (but not accidental) products of the activity of unconscious processes. More or less \u201cdeliberate\u201d ignorance is a frequent reason for potential patients to avoid or delay medical examination. The practical problem is how to counteract this unfavorable tendency.",
