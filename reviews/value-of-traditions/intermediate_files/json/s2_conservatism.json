      "abstract": "The paper\u00a0 investigates the thought of Edmund Burke, trying to understand and giving special attention to the conservative philosophy by which the author underlies within his political philosophy. The research here described focuses especially on the analysis and approach present in the author's edifying work, Reflections on the Revolution in France, and how these approaches have contributed to spread and generate modern conservatism, relying on its approaches as values, such as tradition, defense of order, hierarchy, communitarianism and opposition to rationalism, for the idea of the people assuming power as a fundamental part of a conservative policy, thus against monarchical absolutism, which went against Burke's thought in the sense that power should be dissolved among all, and decision-making exercised taking into account multi-generational events, thus valuing traditions, so that these important ingredients construct Burke's arguments, which remains present in modern conservative thinking.",

      "abstract": "Is there a political philosophy of conservatism? A history of the phenomenon written along sceptical lines casts doubt on the existence of a transhistorical doctrine, or even an enduring conservative outlook. The main typologies of conservatism uniformly trace its origins to opposition to the French Revolution. Accordingly, Edmund Burke is standardly singled out as the \u2018father\u2019 of this style of politics. Yet Burke was de facto an opposition Whig who devoted his career to assorted programmes of reform. In restoring Burke to his original milieu, the argument presented here takes issue with 20th-century accounts of conservative ideology developed by such figures as Karl Mannheim, Klaus Epstein and Samuel Huntington. It argues that the idea of a conservative tradition is best seen as a belated construction, and that the notion of a univocal philosophy of conservatism is basically misconceived.",

Special attention is given to Burke's and Maistre's visions of violations of the Enlightenment philosophy on the historical and political mission that they believed their nations and humanity should meet. It is concluded that in this formative period, in relation to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the French Revolution, for which the former is held responsible, conservatism formed its own doctrine, Its counter-enlightenment and anti-modernist motives therefore remain distinctive marks of Conservativism to this day.",

The paper is divided into five chapters. The long introductory part is dedicated to the etymological explanation of the word tradition, as well as continuity as one of three key terms in both worldviews. It is important here to underline that tradition always refers to one specific culture. Hence, the author has offered several insights in the traditions of certain cultures. The second chapter deals with the importance and acceptance of adaptation or change, while the third part is dedicated to the place and importance of freedom in the mentioned frameworks. The fourth part defines traditionalism and the place of a traditional man in the contemporary world. In conclusion, in the fifth chapter, the author has defined overlapping and differing stances of two types of conservativism (Anglo-American and European) and tradition vis-\u00e0-vis continuity, change and freedom.",

      "abstract": "I. Kant and E. Burke both presented and developed their political views in 1790s in the common context of the French Revolution. We compare their views in two aspects. First, we consider the question whether Kant in his writings has implicitly referred to Burke\u2019s pamphlet \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France\u201d. In our view, it remains unproven and doubtful that Kant had read this book (in German translation). Second, we consider Kant\u2019s political views as liberal and Burke\u2019s ones as conservative. We rely on those scholars who distinguish liberalism and conservatism building on the anthropological foundations of political philosophy. Some scholars define Kant\u2019s moderate liberalism as a variation of conservatism, although Kant explicitly criticizes a number of ultra-conser\u00advative views. Burke is widely known as the founder of modern conservatism but also has substantial liberal points in his views. Both philosophers sought to find balance between stability and improvement of a political order, but they propose completely different cri\u00adteria for a reform policy. For Kant, all reforms should aim to realize the abstract ideal of universal law. Alongside, Kant recommends only moderate and prudent reforms in or\u00adder to preserve the freedom and safety of states as political organisms. Burke views re\u00adforms as a means of reconciling traditions and customs with changing circumstances. Our conclusion is that Burke cannot be named among the prototypes of those ultra-con\u00adservatives whom Kant describes as the most implacable opponents of his views. We sup\u00adport the assessment of Kant\u2019s position as conservative liberalism and Burke's position as liberal conservatism. This perspective reveals a certain similarity of their views despite their fundamental differences.",

      "abstract": "It has long seemed self-evident to many scholars and critics that conservative thought should be divided into two parts. The first would be its stable core of ideas\u2014 including, perhaps, a skeptical attitude toward reason, or a politics of prudence, or a sober view of human nature. Then there would be its multitudinous array of contingent, sometimes eccentric, and occasionally even regrettable expressions. Such an approach provides a convenient way of explaining any illiberal, authoritarian, or atavistic arguments by conservatives. According to this approach, these types of arguments can be assigned to the broad category of the accidental and ephemeral. This particular kind of taxonomy would seem to be doing rather strenuous explanatory work at this moment, in which the memory is still fresh of the functional leader of the conservative movement in America praising the \u201cvery fine people\u201d among a march of white supremacists and neo-Nazis, some of whom had been chanting antiSemitic slogans and one of whom hadmurdered a counterdemonstrator. It is the signal contribution of the original edition of Corey Robin\u2019s The Reactionary Mind (2011) that it offered a compelling alternative to the standard classificatory approach: a new vision that was at once striking and (for many) provoking but also consistent with what many conservatives have always said about themselves. And it provided this alternative, one that could account for Donald Trump, well before anyone took him seriously. Robin\u2019s argument is that it is not primarily any core of ideas that explains conservatism but instead a continually renewed, yet protean purpose. Since the eighteenth century, he observes\u2014in both the 2011 edition and the thoroughly revised 2018 version\u2014a great many movements have attempted to make good on the modern promises of freedom and equality, extending those ideals to those who have been previously denied them. Conservatism, Robin contends, is best thought of as all the varied responses to these varied movements. It is \u201cthe theoretical voice,\u201d he writes, of \u201canimus\u201d against them (p. 7). And so \u201call conservatives,\u201d Robin argues \u201care, in one way or another, counterrevolutionary\u201d or reactionary (p. 29). This orientation toward meeting democratic challenges, according to Robin, predisposes conservatives toward arguments and affinities that seem surprising from the perspective of the standard ideal-typical depiction of the ideology. It inclines them to be activist rather than prudent, to admire the rhetoric and dynamism of revolutionaries (pp. 45\u201350), and, by contrast, to be impatient with old regimes and their inability to mount effective self-defenses against democratizing movements (pp. 41\u201345). It predisposes them to try to reach far beyond the ranks of traditional elites to recruit supporters\u2014and so to create new coalitions and structures of inequality (pp. 50\u201354). And this, in turn, makes conservatism attractive to at least some self-defined outsiders and inclines it to portray itself as an outsider\u2019s voice of dispossession. Robin\u2019s identification of the continual reactionary impulse and these related tendencies does not mean that he discerns no variety in conservatism, as a number of his critics claimed seven or eight years ago. In fact, he portrays conservatism as diverse and, by need, perennially innovative. This portrayal is perhaps even clearer in the new edition of the book. Robin has revised extensively, omitted several chapters, and added a few others\u2014 including one on Trump\u2014and reorganized the whole into one part introducing the main arguments and two more parts with essays on various conservative thinkers. Robin describes the book as consisting of themes and variations, and the variations include interpretive essays that are often, by turns, elegant and surprising. There is a compact essay on Thomas Hobbes, showing how he responded to the challenges of \u201cdemocraticals\u201d by innovations that traditional monarchists found frightening (pp. 91\u2013103). Another chapter explores the surprising affinity between Nietzsche and neoliberal economists and their ancestors, from Stanley Jevons to Friedrich Hayek (pp. 133\u201364). Hayek and others, Robin argues in this essay, valorize \u201ca conception of political life as the embodiment of ancient ideals of aristocratic action, aesthetic notions of artistic creation, and a rarefied vision of the warrior,\u201d but they locate that vision \u201cnot in high affairs of state but in the operations and personnel of a capitalist economy\u201d (p. 133). He argues in another essay (pp. 201\u201320) that latetwentieth-century neoconservatives like Irving Kristol, by contrast with Hayek, found themselves dismayed by the ascendancy of market values in late-twentieth-century America, and longed for the return of a nation that would claim an \u201cimperial role\u201d (p. 202). Robin\u2019s capstone essay on Trump (pp. 239\u201372) depicts him as illustrating many of the themes developed in the rest of the book, such as recurrent conservative efforts to create \u201ca new-old regime that, in one way or another, makes privilege popular\u201d (p. 243). In Trump\u2019s obsession with besting others in combat, similarly, Robin finds the resurfacing of an atavistic, agonistic vein of conservativism. Readers may be surprised that Robin argues that Trump has accomplished little and that the increasingly weak national electoral performances of Republicans show that their \u201cfusion of elitism and populism has grown brittle\u201d (p. 268). He casts Trump\u2019s most incendiary bigotry and antidemocratic acts as signs of conservative",
