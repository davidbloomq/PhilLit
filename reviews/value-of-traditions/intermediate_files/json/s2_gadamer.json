      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to show how Gadamer highlights the importance that prejudices, authorities and tradition play in the hermeneutic experience, but also to critically review his reasons in support of his position to base his philosophical hermeneutics through them. What Gadamer tries to show with his theory is that prejudices, authorities, and tradition are closely related to many other phenomena that arise during a deeper consideration of interpretation and understanding in general, and which must not be overlooked during this consideration. In the paper, I will first present Gadamer\u2019s motivation for restoring the neutral status of prejudices and placing them in the foundations of his philosophical hermeneutics, then I will present some of the consequences that this understanding has for the hermeneutic procedure, and finally I will show how Gadamer\u2019s understanding of authority and tradition derives from prior examination of prejudice status",

      "abstract": "German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer is best known for his contribution to the development of philosophical hermeneutics, an interpretive approach to knowledge, understanding and meaning-making. It has become a well-established research approach in the health sciences to shed light on the lived experiences of people living with challenging chronic health conditions. Some feminist scholars have gravitated to Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics for its steadfast rejection of positivism and its intention to uncover preunderstandings and prejudices. However, others have critiqued the approach for its lack of focus on prescribing action for social change and its reluctance to evaluate the prejudices present in its own tradition. In this paper, the authors will demonstrate how using feminist hermeneutics can help health researchers deepen their understanding of illness narratives by examining the power structures contributing to the marginalization of chronically ill people within and outside the healthcare system. They will juxtapose a reflexive investigation of the first author\u2019s experiences with a focused literature review of the dialogue between hermeneutics and feminism. By examining the first author\u2019s experiences with Gadamerian hermeneutics and feminist hermeneutics through self-study, she can in turn unearth her own preunderstandings. This approach will allow the authors to leverage the depth of interpretive understanding generated by hermeneutics while exploring the power structures involved in the complex process that is patient care, particularly that of people with chronic illness. They conclude that this combined approach of feminist hermeneutics allows health researchers to deepen their understanding of illness narratives with issue-specific and effective recommendations to clinicians and public health officials, leading to better-adapted services through a more just approach to chronically ill people.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines two competing approaches to the study of addiction: the neuroscientific model which conceives of addiction as a brain disease, and the phenomenological critique of neuroscience, which appeals to lived experience. I employ Gadamer\u2019s rich hermeneutic contribution to the phenomenological tradition in order to generate more fruitful dialogue between these competing models. Gadamer\u2019s critique of the leveling of language in science is employed to counter neuroscientific claims to objectivity, while his redescription of the constructive role of prejudice in understanding is employed to highlight inadequacies in the phenomenological critique of neuroscience. Ultimately, I propose a fusion of these contested horizons which can generate richer clinical practice\u2014reimagining the role of addiction recovery as helping individuals interpret and understand their experience of addiction toward new ways of being in the world.",

      "abstract": "A foundation stone of Hans Georg Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics is the notion of the sensus communis. The philosophical significance of a \u201csensus communis\u201d (common sense) begins with Aristotle, who offered scattered reflections. The topic was taken up in earnest in Enlightenment thought and in German idealism, but it became more of an individual faculty, lacking the deep sense of community and tradition found in earlier formulations. In this paper, the author demonstrates Gadamer\u2019s debt to Pietist thought, examining his appropriation and use of the theology of Friedrich Christoph Oetinger (1702\u20131782), a leading figure in Swabian Pietism, whose ideas had a significant impact in theological circles and broader cultural life. Gadamer\u2019s critique of the Enlightenment\u2019s \u2018prejudice against prejudice,\u2019 owes a debt to the Pietist conception of the sensus communis and his practical philosophy to Pietism\u2019s emphasis on \u2018application\u2019 as a fundamental aspect of a hermeneutical triad.",

This article explores the emergence and transformation in governance of Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga River using an interpretive approach based on philosophical hermeneutics. Drawing on Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutic concepts of tradition, authority, and prejudice, this research reveals how hermeneutic space is created in dialogue, deliberations, and collaborative work. This more fluid understanding for the governance process has key ramifications for public administration research and practice in terms of an ontological understanding of governance, rethinking of the practice of administrative skills, and shifting the manner in which authority is understood and exercised.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to show how Gadamer highlights the importance that prejudices, authorities and tradition play in the hermeneutic experience, but also to critically review his reasons in support of his position to base his philosophical hermeneutics through them. What Gadamer tries to show with his theory is that prejudices, authorities, and tradition are closely related to many other phenomena that arise during a deeper consideration of interpretation and understanding in general, and which must not be overlooked during this consideration. In the paper, I will first present Gadamer\u2019s motivation for restoring the neutral status of prejudices and placing them in the foundations of his philosophical hermeneutics, then I will present some of the consequences that this understanding has for the hermeneutic procedure, and finally I will show how Gadamer\u2019s understanding of authority and tradition derives from prior examination of prejudice status",
