      "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Although perceived as a wrong act, insurance fraud is a prevalent phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to understand the psychological factors that lead to reporting an exaggerated/false insurance claim would enable insurance companies and policy makers to devise better preventive policies. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Utilizing data-driven clustering techniques on psychological and demographic measures from 985 insurance customers in Europe, this study outlines profiles of segments of customers as it relates to dishonesty in dealing with insurance companies. The segmentation criteria include attitude toward insurance fraud, perceived probability of punishment, basic human values and morals, religiosity, life satisfaction and demographic characteristics. Findings \u2013 Results reveal the existence of four market segments. The segments include non-conservatives (sensitive to both perception of wrong behavior and the monetary payoff for a fraudulent claim), self-protectionists (sensitive to the probability of being caught), hedonists (sensitive to the personal pleasure and monetary payoffs for insurance fraud) and socially focused individuals (sensitive to social norms regarding admitting to having committed insurance fraud). Among the demographic variables, only education and among psychological variables, universalism, hedonism, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, moral philosophy, religiosity, perceived probability of punishment and attitude toward insurance fraud were significantly different among the four identified segments. Practical implications \u2013 Specific policies are proposed in order to prevent insurance fraud, tailored to the specific profile of each segment. Originality/value \u2013 Using a psychological perspective and a data-driven methodology, this study identifies four heterogeneous segments of unethical insurance customers with dissimilar values, attitudes toward fraud and perception of punishment probability.",

      "abstract": "Scholarly efforts to understand conspiracy theories have grown significantly in recent years, and there is now a broad and interdisciplinary literature. In reviewing this body of work, we ask three specific questions. First, what factors are associated with conspiracy beliefs? Our review of the literature shows that conspiracy beliefs result from a range of psychological, political, and social factors. Next, how are conspiracy theories communicated? Here, we explain how conspiracy theories are shared among individuals and spread through traditional and social media platforms. Next, what are the societal risks and rewards associated with conspiracy theories? By focusing on politics and science, we argue that conspiracy theories do more harm than good. We conclude by suggesting several promising avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, a significant number of Latin American countries have questioned the Washington consensus and financial valorization. In doing so, they have moved into the paradigm of the commodities consensus and the large-scale exportation of raw materials. These processes have led to a series of important political and economic changes, while also opening a new phase of conflict linked to the appropriation and dispossession of territories and natural resources. Starting from a regional scenario pierced with strong tensions and asymmetries, this article examines the current phase of capital accumulation in Latin America, focusing on critical concepts such as neoextractivism and bad development. It presents a particular reading of environmental conflict, linked to processes of dispossession, enclosure of the common, and the deepening of extractivism by Latin American progressive governments. The article also explores some prescriptive categories spanning contemporary Latin American thought and debate linked to the environmentalization of struggles. These concepts include buen vivir (living well), the rights of nature, and the commons. To conclude, it briefly reviews the debate around transition and postextractivism.",

We begin by documenting the relative insularity of economics, using bibliometric data. Next we analyze the tight management of the field from the top down, which gives economics its characteristic hierarchical structure. Economists also distinguish themselves from other social scientists through their much better material situation (many teach in business schools, have external consulting activities), their more individualist worldviews, and their confidence in their discipline's ability to fix the world's problems. Taken together, these traits constitute what we call the superiority of economists, where economists' objective supremacy is intimately linked with their subjective sense of authority and entitlement. While this superiority has certainly fueled economists' practical involvement and their considerable influence over the economy, it has also exposed them more to conflicts of interests, political critique, even derision.",

      "abstract": "We live in an age of extreme corporate concentration, in which global industries are controlled by just a few giant firms \u2013 big banks, big pharma, and big tech, just to name a few. But concern over what Louis Brandeis called the \u201ccurse of bigness\u201d can no longer remain the province of specialist lawyers and economists, for it has spilled over into policy and politics, even threatening democracy itself. History suggests that tolerance of inequality and failing to control excessive corporate power may prompt the rise of populism, nationalism, extremist politicians, and fascist regimes. In short, as Wu warns, we are in grave danger of repeating the signature errors of the twentieth century. In The Curse of Bigness, Columbia professor Tim Wu tells of how figures like Brandeis and Theodore Roosevelt first confronted the democratic threats posed by the great trusts of the Gilded Age \u2013 but the lessons of the Progressive Era were forgotten in the last 40 years. He calls for recovering the lost tenets of the trustbusting age as part of a broader revival of American progressive ideas as we confront the fallout of persistent and extreme economic inequality.",

      "abstract": "Previous research shows that, when it comes to foreign policy, individuals have general orientations that inform their beliefs toward more specific issues in international relations. But such studies evade an even more important question: what gives rise to such foreign-policy orientations in the first place? Combining an original survey on a nationally representative sample of Americans with Schwartz's theory of values from political psychology, we show that people take foreign policy personally: the same basic values that people use to guide choices in their daily lives also travel to the domain of foreign affairs. Conservation values are most strongly linked to \u201cmilitant internationalism,\u201d a general hawkishness in international relations. The value of universalism is the most important value for predicting \u201ccooperative internationalism,\u201d the foreign-policy orientation marked by a preference for multilateralism and cosmopolitanism in international affairs. This relatively parsimonious and elegant system of values and foreign-policy beliefs is consistent across both high- and low-knowledge respondents, offering one potential explanation for why those people who are otherwise uninformed about world politics nonetheless express coherent foreign-policy beliefs.",

However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called \"filter bubbles\". This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.",

From this work, many have drawn the conclusion that an efficient global emissions abatement policy comprises modest and modestly increasing controls.

      "abstract": "With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives, changing our behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease is a moral imperative. Here, we investigated the persuasiveness of messages inspired by three major moral traditions. A sample of US participants representative for age, sex and race/ethnicity (N=1032) viewed messages from either a leader or citizen containing deontological, virtue-based, utilitarian, or non-moral justifications for adopting social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the messages\u2019 effects on participants\u2019 self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about others\u2019 intentions, impressions of the messenger\u2019s morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianism\u2014impartial concern for the greater good\u2014were strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Ongoing work is investigating the reproducibility and generalizability of our findings across different populations, what aspects of deontological messages may drive their persuasive effects, and how such messages can be most effectively delivered across global populations.",

      "abstract": "In the field of psychology, <i>filial piety</i> is usually defined in terms of traditional Chinese culture-specific family traditions. The problem with this approach is that it tends to emphasize identification of behavioral rules or norms, which limits its potential for application in other cultural contexts. Due to the global trend of population aging, governments are searching for solutions to the accompanying financial burden so greater attention is being focused on the issue of elder care and its relevance to filial practices. We contend that the psychological investigation of filial piety in Chinese societies has progressed to the point that it can now provide a solid structure for research targeting intergenerational relations in other cultures. We describe an indigenous psychology approach that integrated Chinese historical, philosophical, and social trends to construct a model of filial piety in terms of the dual reciprocal and authoritarian filial aspects underlying parent-child relations: the dual filial piety model (DFPM). We use this model to re-conceptualize filial piety from its usual definition as a set of Chinese culture-specific norms to a contextualized personality construct represented by a pair of culturally-sensitive psychological schemas of parent-child interaction. We then describe how the DFPM can provide a framework for research on filial relations on individual, structural, societal, and cross-cultural levels. We conclude with a discussion of how the model may be able to integrate and extend Western research on intergenerational relations and contribute to the issue of elder care beyond Chinese societies.",

      "abstract": "The greatest artist does not have any concept Which a single piece of marble does not itself contain Within its excess, though only A hand that obeys the intellect can discover it. Michelangelo Buonarroti Fidelity to the facts in political theory is often associated with a conservative slant, or at least a tendency to prefer incremental reformism to radicalism. Political realism\u2014both in its classical manifestations and its contemporary revival1\u2014is frequently linked to that tendency. For instance, in recent works we read that realism can lead to a \u201ccollapsing of the space for serious challenges to major social and political institutions (Markell, 2010, p. 176), that \u201cthe closer political theorists are to politics the more their own judgment and frailties will be tested\u201d (Philp, 2012, p. 646), and that \u201crealism will inevitably tend to nudge us towards a greater acceptance of the status quo, towards more modesty in the change that we are prepared to propose or demand\u201d (Finlayson, 2017, p. 271). In this article I resist those claims, and contribute to the project of reclaiming the radical potential of political realism (Brinn, 2019; Cross, 2019; Honig & Stears, 2011; McKean, 2016; McQueen, 2016; Prinz, 2016; Raekstad, 2016; Prinz & Rossi, 2017). I develop a form of realism as genealogy\u2013both debunking and vindicatory\u2013and show how it can be more radical than both ideal and nonideal approaches to normative political theory. I arrive at this conclusion by addressing two related, partly methodological and partly substantive challenges facing realism. The first challenge concerns the very possibility of a realist normative political theory: if characterizing realism by contrasting it with moralism means that political judgment is not to be derived from pre-political moral commitments, what other sources of political normativity are available? The second challenge is status quo bias: does realism's fidelity to the facts condemn it to some form of conservative complacency? I argue that there is an important sense in which realists can support radical and even unachievable political change\u2014one can be realistic and demand the impossible, as the soixante-huitard slogan goes. To see how that may be the case one needs to characterize realism by contrasting it with both nonideal theory and utopianism (in a pejorative sense of the term, as I shall clarify). In a nutshell, realism differs from nonideal theory because it need not be concerned with feasibility constraints, and it differs from utopianism because it eschews plans of the perfect polity or for the correct course of political action. Utopianism, realism and nonideal theory are all technical terms, so my definitions will by necessity be stipulative, though, it is to be hoped, not overly controversial. With those distinctions in place it will become clear that moralism is at greater risk of status quo bias than realism because of its relative blindness to ideological bias. Whereas realism, I argue, is an approach grounded in our best social-scientific accounts of politics, but not in such a way as to jeopardize the transformative potential of our political imagination. The upshot is that, if we set aside the quasi-technocratic aspirations of a political theory geared to generate immediate policy guidance, realism (rather than nonideal theory) emerges as the best bet for those sympathetic to many of the concerns about fidelity to the facts of real politics raised in current methodological debates (e.g., Estlund, 2014, 2017; Freeden, 2012; Hamlin & Stemplowska, 2012; Horton, 2017; Miller, 2016; Mills, 2005; Rossi, 2016; Valentini, 2012; Wiens, 2012). That, however, this not true of all forms of realism. In fact, after briefly characterizing realism in the next section, I move on to distinguishing between ordorealism, contextual realism, and radical realism. I then show how each approach draws on different sources of normativity and, relatedly, exhibits fidelity to a different set of facts about politics. I associate ordorealism with the prioritization of peace and stability, contextual realism with practice-dependent norms, and radical realism with a form of ideology critique. I then contrast realism with nonideal theory and discuss utopianism and the prospects for a radical realism. I characterize a version of radical realism with a distinctive epistemic normativity, which has radical potential that surpasses what is found in moralist political theory and also opens a new option in the debate on the status of normativity in Marxism. That is because, while radical realism avoids potentially ideological moralizing, it can inform open-ended social critique as well as lend support to concrete forms of prefigurative politics. To be sure, that is not sufficient to establish the superiority of realism to moralism, and not even to identify the all-things-considered best form of realism. My aim here is more modest: I want to show that, pace some critics (Erman & M\u00f6ller, 2015a; Estlund, 2017; Leader-Maynard & Worsnip, 2018; Scheuerman, 2013), contemporary realism is a distinctive and consistent position in normative political theory, and that at least one of its variants does not suffer from a status quo bias\u2014rather, it is as radical as it gets. Moral philosophy sets the background for, and the boundaries of, political philosophy. What persons may and may not do to one another limits what they may do through the apparatus of a state, or do to establish such an apparatus. (Nozick, 1974, p. 6) While that approach remains prevalent in contemporary Anglo-American political philosophy, realists claim that no overarching principles that span personal morality and politics are plausible. That may appear to fly in the face of simple consistency requirements: if there are true overarching moral principles (\u201cbring about the greatest good for the greatest number,\u201d or \u201cnever lie,\u201d say),\u2014where \u201coverarching\u201d means that they apply to any agent regardless of whether the context of action is politics or not\u2014then shouldn't we just apply them to our political predicament, in a categorical or even just pro tanto way? The realist contention is that moralists beg the question of whether there are any such principles spanning the personal and the political\u2014a fraught distinction we will discuss in the next subsection\u2014or at least whether they are good guides to political action or judgment. That is not to say that non-overarching principles are just role ethics principles for political office-holders (Estlund, 2017, p. 366), for non-overarching principles are not just a context-specific application of overarching principles. More precisely, non-overarching, properly political principles don't draw on the same sources of normativity as moral principles. That is why realists believe that there are no overarching principles. If such overarching moral principles existed, then at least a significant portion of normative political theory would be a branch of applied ethics. If realists can show that they can make normative political judgments that don't draw on overarching principles and so don't share the sources of normativity of moral principles, then they will have made room for their view. One may reply that the lack of overarching moral principles doesn't preclude the notion that politics should be governed by moral principles, albeit moral principles that apply only to the political domain (Estlund, 2017, p. 367). That is a point realists who are not overly concerned with semantics are ready to concede (Williams, 2005, p. 5). What matters is that realist normative standards\u2014however one may wish to call them\u2014are not inferred from overarching, pre-political values or principles.2 The main arguments in favor of the rejection of overarching moral principles, i.e., the realist thesis about the normative autonomy of the political, could be crudely summarized by this slogan: if morality could solve political problems, we wouldn't have politics. I want to distinguish between three argumentative strategies in support of this claim, each of which leads to a different strand of realism: ordorealism, contextual realism, and radical realism. Three caveats about that taxonomy are in order. First, my task here isn't to show how these arguments defeat moralism, but simply to articulate the positions realists may take. Second, those are Weberian ideal types; most worked out positions incorporate elements from more than one of the three approaches. Third, I make no consequential hermeneutical claims about any of the canonical figures I mention to fix ideas, nor about their reception. Ordorealism has a familiar Hobbesian starting point, which Bernard Williams calls \u2018the first political question\u2019: \u201cthe securing of order, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation\u201d (Williams, 2005, p. 3). The basic thought is that, left to their own devices, including their own ethical judgments, people conflict, with highly undesirable results\u2014so much so that ethical judgment itself may be reduced to a dead letter. Morality or justice are not in themselves a way out of this problem but, as Hobbes saw, they may be instruments through which political power enables us to solve that problem. So we need a freestanding sphere of political normativity if there is to be scope for personal morality, let alone most other trappings of human sociality. Note how leaving (or not falling into) the state of nature is considered desirable not out of some moral commitment to the desirability of political association,3 but simply because it is a precondition for the enjoyment of most of what we happen to take to be valuable, morally or otherwise (Williams, 2005, p. 3). This is a modest point about the instrumental value of political association. As such it is an empirical claim, and one that probably wouldn't hold true in the few remaining small-scale stateless societies (Widerquist & McCall, 2015). But a certain contingency even of its basic claims is characteristic of the empiricist roots of this strand of realism. The contextual strategy's starting point can also be understood as beginning empirically, through an observation of the phenomenological difference between the political and the personal. One doesn't need to invoke Carl Schmitt to note that something is amiss in the thought that lying to my friends is bad for the same reasons that lying in a political campaign is bad, if indeed it is. This approach may remind us of Machiavelli's claims about the tensions between personal and political values and so of the unlikeliness of a unified source for both. Yet realists need not endorse the more radical and old-fashioned readings of Machiavelli, according to which there is no salient difference between legitimate authority and effective power. Indeed some realists elevate such a distinction to a foundational principle (Sagar, 2018). The important point is just that the normative standards that apply to the exercise of political power are different from those that apply to personal relationships. Here, however, one may worry that contextual realists have failed to learn the feminist lesson encapsulated in the slogan, \u201cthe personal is political.\u201d To assuage that worry, one may distinguish the personal/political boundary from the public/private one. Many liberal theorists consider them to be equivalent, or in any case focus solely on the latter, as their main concern is to identify the appropriate sphere of legitimate state intervention. So they tend to accommodate feminist concerns by acknowledging that, while the public/private line may have been drawn in the wrong place, the distinction remains viable and important (Gavison, 1992). Liberal realists, qua liberals, will be unable to accommodate the radical position of feminists who reject the public/private distinction altogether (MacKinnon, 1989). But realists need not be liberals, and if they aren't they can focus on the personal/political line instead, which in turn may allow for kinship with quite radical feminist positions (Frazer, 2015). That is because the personal/political distinction is not about a narrow liberal concern with the limits of state action. When the slogan was coined in the 1960s, feminists wanted to point out that, even in movements uninterested in the state or antagonistic towards it, the sphere of appropriately political action was conceived too narrowly, often in ways that marginalized issues of concern to women (Finlayson, 2016, pp. 125\u2013128). That is not to say that the line cannot be drawn. Rather, the slogan reminds us to look with suspicion at any established, ossified way of drawing the line between the personal and the political. The point about questioning the received wisdom about issues like the political/personal divide\u2014critiquing them as ideology, if you will\u2014leads to the third and final strategy at the realist's disposal, the radical one whose guiding thought is that \u201cethics is usually dead politics; the hand of a victor in a past conflict reaching out to extend its grip to the present and the future,\u201d as Raymond Geuss puts it (2010, p. 42). Insofar as morality is influenced by political power, moral advocacy for political actions and institutions should be the object of critical suspicion\u2014more so than most mainstream, ethics-first political theory allows. That point highlights a connection between the radical and ordorealist approaches. For ordorealists morality and justice are instrumenta regni. The radical approach shares that insight. However, on the ordorealist view the priority remains to establish order by whatever means necessary and so the insight is not problematized. The radical approach tries to establish criteria for making qualitative distinctions between the moral (and other) beliefs that support political authority. Different strands of realism assign different relative weights to stability and ideology, and resolve the trade-off accordingly. As I will show in a moment, the insistence on meeting the basic legitimation demand is ordorealist, the references to a form of legitimation specifically suited for modernity are contextual, and the litmus test for the admissibility of beliefs in legitimacy is radical. The basic legitimation demand exemplifies the ordorealist approach insofar as it requires the provision of order and stability, so relative success in meeting the demand becomes the basis of normative judgments. Importantly, though, the coercive provision of order is conceptually distinguishable from raw domination, which is suspended warfare rather than a political relationship (Hall, 2015)\u2014all politics is coercive, but not all coercion is political. While it is possible to say of any regime whether it meets the basic legitimation demand, the notions of order and stability here can be filled in in context-dependent ways: what might have been acceptable politics in feudal Europe would not pass muster now. Politics versus raw domination is a conceptual distinction, but ordorealists can accommodate conceptual change. Yet a prudent attitude towards change prevails among realists who emphasize those concerns. So, simplifying somewhat, in the work of Matt Sleat (2013a) and Andrew Sabl (2011, 2017) we find defenses of relatively conservative versions of liberalism, with an emphasis on providing a stable outlet for the management of diversity social conflict while renouncing the neo-Kantian project of neutral arbitration. Contextual realism can be associated with a practice-dependent approach to the sources of normativity (Sangiovanni, 2008; Rossi, 2012). The rough idea is that normative political principles are grounded in an interpretation of the point and purpose of particular political practices. The contextual realist, then, constructs her normative standards by asking whether the point and purpose of a particular set of institutions is genuinely political (i.e., whether it addresses the right questions about the provision of order, etc.), and whether those institutions are suited to their purpose. In Williams's theory this is exemplified by the connection between modernity and liberalism: an analysis of the historical context yields an account of the most suitable regime. This is a different level of evaluation from that which a pure ordorealist approach would warrant. For it allows us to rank alternative legitimate regimes on the basis of their fitness for purpose. Robert Jubb's recent defense of non-intrinsic egalitarianism exemplifies this approach (Jubb, 2015). Crudely, on Jubb's view an egalitarian standard turns out to be required for legitimacy on the basis of a reading of what may be expected of political institutions under contemporary conditions. New realist work on the legitimacy and justice of the EU similarly draws on Williams-inspired practice dependence (Beetz, 2017). The radical approach, on the other hand, acquires its normativity by contesting what one may call legitimation stories. Williams's critical theory principle provides a good illustration. The distinction between necessary political coercion and raw domination partly depends on whether the exercise of political power makes sense to those over whom it is exercised (Williams, 2005, pp. 4\u20136), but this perception can be manipulated by ideology. For Williams this happens when a belief in the legitimacy of a coercive order is caused by the very power it supports and is in the interest of that power (Williams, 2002, pp. 230\u2013234; 2005, p. 6; Sagar, 2018). One may not find that account of ideological distortion persuasive, but radical-minded realists must have one in order to make good the idea that there is more to legitimacy than a belief in it. And, importantly, the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable legitimation stories is not moral but epistemic: ideological legitimation stories just aren't what they purport to be, so epistemic caution requires us to disregard them, as we will see in 3.2 below (Prinz & Rossi, 2017).4 Recent realist work in this of the ideology of political (Finlayson, as well as of policy or normative (Prinz & Rossi, Rossi, 2017; & 2017; & Prinz, critique of the ideological nature of political may also be read in this That of realism should some way towards why realism is from nonideal theory, even though it is frequently with it by the many theorists who it to an approach on \u201cthe concrete among made by with (Markell, 2010, p. or on the that politics is by 2017, p. realism and nonideal theory are about \u201cthe more than most contemporary political theory but here I will show that, at least for some variants of realism, we are about different of that has for the level of to each Crudely, nonideal theory is a set of for how best to our normative political in the This can be to point to a of between ideal and nonideal theory, much as or to a need to with political as to the ideal polity Wiens, out of about the or because one the ideal as an ideological from concrete for social change us these I just want to show that there is a consequential distinction between nonideal theory and realism. our account of nonideal theory, a of facts is to a role in facts about feasibility the of an ideal theory a desirable and the or unachievable political state of nonideal theory will us what is the best way to the what is If we reject the of and that normative should rank political one another as to some ideal then nonideal theory will of a between the values in alternative way nonideal theory is a or a set of criteria for the of of the three realist strategies for political will a role in each but they don't have to be facts about feasibility for all of realism. the in to be the a of that point The third the difference between and nonideal theory. we may say that the to the status quo become as we through the the right is to contain facts about ordorealists will have to identify political that can order in the This of realism is indeed most often associated with the conservative or figures in the also an important role in versions of contemporary liberal realism 2017; 2012; that are on or about social change than liberal theory. in that is to from the status As we have that realism and nonideal theory one we may say that, insofar as they have to take feasibility ordorealists are nonideal theorists of realism.

      "abstract": "Machine learning currently exerts an outsized influence on the world, increasingly affecting institutional practices and impacted communities. It is therefore critical that we question vague conceptions of the field as value-neutral or universally beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is advancing. In this paper, we first introduce a method and annotation scheme for studying the values encoded in documents such as research papers. Applying the scheme, we analyze 100 highly cited machine learning papers published at premier machine learning conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features of papers which reveal their values: their justification for their choice of project, which attributes of their project they uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find that few of the papers justify how their project connects to a societal need (15%) and far fewer discuss negative potential (1%). Through line-by-line content analysis, we identify 59 values that are uplifted in ML research, and, of these, we find that the papers most frequently justify and assess themselves based on Performance, Generalization, Quantitative evidence, Efficiency, Building on past work, and Novelty. We present extensive textual evidence and identify key themes in the definitions and operationalization of these values. Notably, we find systematic textual evidence that these top values are being defined and applied with assumptions and implications generally supporting the centralization of power. Finally, we find increasingly close ties between these highly cited papers and tech companies and elite universities.",

It argues for a conceptualization of the asylum-migration nexus within the framework of Anibal Quijano\u2019s \u201ccoloniality of power\u201d by developing the analytical framework of the \u201ccoloniality of migration.\u201d Through the analytical framework of the \u201ccoloniality of migration\u201d the connection between racial capitalism and the asylum-migration nexus is explored. It does so by first focusing on the economic and political links between asylum and migration, and how both constitute each other. On these grounds, it discusses how asylum and migration policies produce hierarchical categories of migrants and refugees, producing a nomenclature drawing on an imaginary reminiscent of the orientalist and racialized practices of European colonialism and imperialism. In a second step, it focuses on migration and asylum policies as inherent to a logic of racialization of the workforce. It does so by first exploring the racial coding of immigration policies within the context of settler colonial-ism and transatlantic White European migration to the Am\u00e9ricas and Oceania in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and second, by discussing migration policies in post-1945 Western Europe.",

      "abstract": "Given the abundance of open education initiatives that aim to make educational assets freely available online, the time seems ripe to explore the potential of open education to transform the economics and ecology of education. Despite the diversity of tools and resources already availablefrom well-packaged course materials to simple games, for students, self-learners, faculty, and educational institutionswe have yet to take full advantage of shared knowledge about how these are being used, what local innovations are emerging, and how to learn from and build on the experiences of others. Opening Up Education argues that we must develop not only the technical capability but also the intellectual capacity for transforming tacit pedagogical knowledge into commonly usable and visible knowledge: by providing incentives for faculty to use (and contribute to) open education goods, and by looking beyond institutional boundaries to connect a variety of settings and open source entrepreneurs. These essays by leaders in open education describe successes, challenges, and opportunities they have found in a range of open education initiatives. They approachfrom both macro and micro perspectivesthe central question of how open education tools, resources, and knowledge can improve the quality of education. The contributors (from leading foundations, academic institutions, associations, and projects) discuss the strategic underpinnings of their efforts first in terms of technology, then content, and finally knowledge. They also address the impact of their projects, and how close they come to achieving a vision of sustainable, transformative educational opportunities that amounts to much more than pervasive technology.

      "abstract": "This review covers research on attitudes and attitude change published between 2010 and 2017. We characterize this period as one of significant progress toward an understanding of how attitudes form and change in three critical contexts. The first context is the person, as attitudes change in connection to values, general goals, language, emotions, and human development. The second context is social relationships, which link attitude change to the communicator of persuasive messages, social media, and culture. The third context is sociohistorical and highlights the influence of unique events, including sociopolitical, economic, and climatic occurrences. In conclusion, many important recent findings reflect the fact that holism, with a focus on situating attitudes within their personal, social, and historical contexts, has become the zeitgeist of attitude research during this period.",

In this paper, I argue that this terminology is not up to scratch, and that academics and journalists ought to completely stop using the terms 'fake news' and 'post-truth'. I set out three arguments for abandonment. First, that 'fake news' and 'post-truth' do not have stable public meanings, entailing that they are either nonsense, context-sensitive, or contested. Secondly, that these terms are unnecessary, because we already have a rich vocabulary for thinking about epistemic dysfunction. Thirdly, I observe that 'fake news' and 'post-truth' have propagandistic uses, meaning that using these terms legitimates anti-democratic propaganda, and risks smuggling bad ideology into conversations.",

But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's book The Paranoid Style in American Politics to doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (total N = 5049)\u2014including national samples\u2014we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general ( r = .27, 95% CI: .24, .30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges' g = .77, SE = .07, p &lt; .001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.",

Yet to date, there has been little evidence on whether citizens of various societies support nudges and nudging. We report the results of nationally representative surveys in six European nations: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We find strong majority support for nudges of the sort that have been adopted, or under serious consideration, in democratic nations. Despite the general European consensus, we find markedly lower levels of support for nudges in two nations: Hungary and Denmark. We are not, in general, able to connect support for nudges with distinct party affiliations.",

However, in the midst of a 21st century, de\u2010colonial scholarly pivot, \u2018opening up development\u2019 fundamentally demands turning the colonial, \u2018white gaze\u2019 on its head. In particular, contemporary social media movements challenging white supremacy such as #BlackLivesMatter have gained prominence while non\u2010white development actors such as China have emerged as enticing alternatives. These phenomena have pried open development with both positive and negative results, intended and unintended consequences. This article seeks to put Critical Development Studies into fluid conversation with Critical Race Studies in an examination of how scholars, policy makers and practitioners have simultaneously succeeded and failed in subverting the \u2018white gaze\u2019 of development.",

In this groundbreaking work, John H. Evans reveals that, with a few limited exceptions, even the most conservative religious Americans accept science\u2019s ability to make factual claims about the world. However, many religious people take issue with the morality implicitly promoted by some forms of science. Using clear and engaging scholarship, Evans upends the prevailing notion that there is a fundamental conflict over the way that scientists and religious people make claims about nature and argues that only by properly understanding moral conflict between contemporary religion and science will we be able to contribute to a more productive interaction between these two great institutions.",

      "abstract": "In his political interventions, J\u00fcrgen Habermas is a first-class rhetorician. His writing style is eloquent, polemical, rich in aper\u00e7us and metaphors, and often affective, especially angry (see M\u00f6llers, 2021, p. 85). But there are also many metaphors in his contributions to philosophy, social theory, and political theory in which he clearly restrains himself rhetorically. Metaphors appear at crucial points in his theory formation. Formulations like the dialogical give and take of reasons \"in kleiner M\u00fcnze\" (small coins), the discursive \"Verfl\u00fcssigung\" (liquefaction) of traditions, the \"colonization\" of the lifeworld, the \"center and periphery\" of modern democracies, or their institutional \"sluices\"\u2014a metaphor he has adopted from Bernhard Peters\u2014create suggestive images in the minds of his readers. The author, who insists on the strict differentiation between day-to-day language, literary language, and the language of the social sciences (see Habermas, 1990a), and whose philosophical self-understanding insists on the \"unforced force of the better argument\" is a master of evocative metaphors. This attribute alone makes it a pleasure to read his texts. The German edition of his new book does not disappoint those readers in search of metaphors either. In the Marxist tradition (see Marx, 2011), a number of metaphors are borrowed from the sphere of geology: \"segments\" (p. 33)1 of the population, \"erosion\" of democracy (p. 87), normative \"slopes\" (p. 15), the \"crumbling\" of the political system (p. 109), or the \"solidified lava\" of anti-authoritarianism in Silicon Valley (p. 46). Some of the metaphors are nautical like normative \"anchors\" (p. 16), or from the theatre, like the \"grimace\" of libertarian political thought (p. 46). Only a few of them belong to organic life: the \"root ground\" of political culture (p. 32), the \"Gleichurspr\u00fcnglichkeit\" (co-originality) of democracy and the rule of law (p. 90), or the \"nesting\" of normative expectations (p. 14). Most of Habermas' metaphors belong to the vocabulary of the technical world: the \"building\" of modern democracy (p. 9), \"centrifugal\" forms of communication (p. 43), the \"architecture\" of constitutional democracy (p. 32), the \"net of historical memory\" (p. 30), the \"Sollbruchstelle\" (predetermined breaking point) of political rights (p. 92), the \"web of attitudes\" (p. 30), the \"social bond\" (p. 31), civil society as an \"early warning system\" (p. 80)\u2014and again the \"flow chart\" of the political system and its \"filters\" and \"sluices\" (p. 24, 100). One has to wait until the last paragraph of the book to find a military metaphor. Now is the time \"den Spie\u00df umzudrehen\"2 (p. 109) and fight the coalition of conspiracy theorists and right-wing populists. Taking Habermas' preference for technical metaphors into account, it comes as no surprise that he has speaks of \"echo chambers\" (p. 45) and \"fragmentation\" (p. 45) in his critical analysis of the digital public sphere. The spatial metaphor of \u00f6ffentlicher Raum (Raum can literally be translated as unlimited space and as clearly limited room) is combined with the technical vocabulary of systems-theory when he mentions the \"input,\" \"throughput,\" and \"output\" components of the institutional infrastructure of the public sphere (pp. 38\u201339). In one passage of the book, Habermas even addresses the problems of metaphorical writing and states that his metaphor Raum \"must not be overstated\" (p. 60). He may have written this sentence from an unfortunate experience. More than once he has become the victim of his metaphor-rich writing style as critics have claimed that formulations like the \"colonization of the lifeworld\" are too vague to have real analytical power in the field of social research. Another example is the term \"ideal speech situation.\" Habermas originally developed the ideal speech situation 1970 in On the Pragmatics of Social Interaction as an epistemological tool used to test the validity of what is essentially true or actually the case (see Habermas, 2001). In this new book, Habermas once again pushes back vehemently against the \"stubborn misunderstanding\" (p. 69) about this term. First, he points out that he has not used \"this misleading expression\" since his 1972 essay on theories of truth. Second, the catchy formulation was never meant to be a blueprint for political institutions, but as a metaphor for the bundle of pragmatic assumptions that we actually always have to start from when we enter into a discourse about validity claims. Nevertheless, some early advocates of the digital revolution in the first half of the 1990s like Howard Rheingold, Nicolas Negroponte, or WIRED magazine authors like John Katz used Habermas' notions of the ideal speech situation and the unrestricted flow of communication in the public sphere as justification for their dreams of a new virtual democracy.3 According to them, the World Wide Web was the technical incarnation of the ideal speech situation. In their view, the Internet matches all basic requirements of a public sphere that comes as close as possible to the normative core of deliberative democracy: The World Wide Web as the communicative infrastructure for open, unlimited, universal, anti-hierarchical, and complex political interaction. To the radical techno-optimists of those days, the Internet created a new political model, since it offered universal access, freedom of expression, unrestricted agendas, uncoerced communication, and political participation outside of traditional political institutions. Habermas reminds the readers of his new book of the big \"emancipatory promise\" of the \"egalitarian and unregulated\" (p. 45) communicative relationships that were propagated at the beginning of the digital age. And indeed, the positive qualities attributed to political communication in the Internet by Rheingold and other optimists of electronic democracy in the 1990s strikingly resemble Habermas' vocabulary (see Buchstein, 1997, pp. 250\u2013251). In his book The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas defined the public sphere as \"a virtually present network of communication\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) that is freed from any spatiotemporally restricted context. Ten years later, in his outline of the deliberative democratic ideal, he advocated a \"decentred society\" in which \"subjectless forms of communication [\u2026] regulate the flow of deliberations\" (Habermas, 1994, p. 7). According to him, \"technologies of communication [\u2026] make possible a highly differentiated network of public spheres\" (Habermas, 1990b, p. 360), The public sphere should consist of an \"open and inclusive network of overlapping, subcultural politics having fluid temporal, social, and substantial boundaries\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 306). In such a \"discursive structuring of public networks and arenas,\" popular sovereignty \"becomes anonymous\" (Habermas, 1998, p. 171). In his new book, Habermas describes digital technology as a third evolutionary stage in the development of means for communication, following the writing of the spoken word a couple of thousand years ago and the introduction of the mechanical printing press at the beginning of early modernity. Despite the \"revolutionary\" (p. 41) change caused by digital technologies, he insists (again) on the social and political neutrality of new technologies. This position\u2014already taken in the late 1960s by Herbert Marcuse\u2014distinguishes Habermas' argument from two rival positions within the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. On the one hand, it departs from the optimistic positions taken by Walter Benjamin in his famous 1936 essay about the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction or Hans-Magnus Enzensberger's Baukasten zu einer Theorie der Medien (1970). On the other hand, it also distances itself from Theodor W. Adorno's critique of alienated consumer culture and the thesis that the essence of the public sphere has been liquidated in the system of mass media in post-liberal societies. Habermas stated in 1992 that the strong influence of Adorno's theory of mass culture was not difficult to discern in the first edition of Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere 30 years ago (see Habermas, 1992, p. 438). There is an element of coquetry in this retrospective statement because already in the early 1960s he had made the point that the consumerist public sphere in a capitalist society should and could be transformed into a more democratic postbourgeois public sphere. The solution he offered in a less known Encyclopedia article from 1964 was a call for political intervention in order to create \"a rational reorganization of social and political power\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). The public sphere should be brought \"under the mutual control of rival organizations committed to the public sphere in their internal structure as well as in their relations with the state and each other\" (Habermas, 1974, p. 55). This sounds like an early neo-corporatist expansion of the way public TV was organized in West Germany in those days. Based on his neutralist position, Habermas already in the very beginning of his work about the public sphere more than 60 years ago subscribed to a strategy of state intervention in order to re-regulate the media system. His considerations in The Theory of Communicative Action of 1981 followed the same pattern. Relying on empirical research, he argued\u2014explicitly against Adorno\u2014that even in shifting from writing to images and sounds, electronic media\u2014movie, radio, and TV\u2014have not turned mass media into an apparatus that completely dominates and permeates the language of everyday communication. Instead, he emphasized the \"ambivalence\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) of modern mass media. But the \"unleashing\" of the \"emancipatory potential,\" which is \"built into communicative structures themselves,\" (Habermas, 1987, p. 390) in the mass media has to be set into action by political measures. Habermas even mentioned Hans Magnus Enzensberger's vision of \"video pluralism\" and \"television democracy\" as attempts to overcome the centralizing media networks in this context. Since then, Habermas has stated repeatedly that modern mass media could both strengthen or undermine the rationality of political communication, depending on the way the infrastructure of the public sphere is regulated (see Habermas, 1992, p. 437). Thirty years after Habermas first published his seminal book about the public sphere stated that there was \"cause for a less pessimistic assessment\" (Habermas, 1992, p. 457) of it and of the future of democracy itself. Another 30 years later, Habermas seems to have returned to pessimism. In his new book, Habermas repeats older statements about the importance of an accommodating, enlightened liberal political culture as the necessary condition for the existence and further development of a democratic political order. His optimism about the further development of western democracies when he published the book Between Facts and Norms in 1992 was still based on his hypothesis about the long-term trend toward a rationalization of the lifeworld. Thanks to the support of post-conventional socialization patterns, families and groups of citizens enter a higher stage of cognitive and moral rationality within their everyday face-to-face communication that also radiates into political communication. As is well known, he adopted the concept of civil society from Andrew Arato and Jean Cohen and turned it into the institutional source for progressive changes of reasons, values, and topics that get transmitted via mass media to the center of the political system. He described civil society as a context of discovery of morally relevant questions arising from the lifeworld. He thus assumed that the lifeworld had a rational advantage in the perception of social problems that were to be transported via social movements and the voluntary associations of civil society into the public sphere. Habermas' overly positive evaluation of social movements and civil society in Between Facts and Norms ignored the fact that a number of voluntary associations already at that time pursued conservative, reactionary, populist, and militant right-wing political goals (see Buchstein, 1994, pp. 107\u2013108). He restricted his considerations about civil society to the question of whether, and to what extent, a public sphere dominated by mass media could provide a realistic chance for the members of civil society to bring about political changes. In Between Facts and Norms, he was relatively optimistic about the possibility of further democratization. In his new book, Habermas is less optimistic. He puts more emphasis on the \"vulnerability\" (p. 30) of the results of socialization patterns and the precarious status of liberal democracies. He states \"political regression\" (p. 41) of liberal democracies around the world seems to have less confidence in the rationalization of the lifeworld. There is a reason for this growing pessimism that has nothing to do with the current Zeitgeist, but follows from a subtle change in Habermas' theory. At first glance, it seems that he is only updating his considerations about the organizational structure of the new media in order to make his argument about the new structural transformation. Both the neutralist position and the state-intervention strategy for a politics of reform and regulation can be found in his book again. Once again, he frames his reflections about the public sphere within his theory of deliberative democracy. He argues that the democratic legitimacy of modern democracies is based on the inclusiveness of the political public sphere. Mass media have an indispensable function, as they ensure the participation of citizens in a common, albeit anonymous, mass communication. Political opinions can only condense into effective public opinions and thus have a targeted influence on political decisions via the publicity of the mass media. Thus, it is imperative that the mass media have an \"enlightening quality\" (p. 23). The centrifugal dissolution of the limits of the simultaneously accelerated political communication to any number of participants at any distance has an \"ambivalent explosive force\" (p. 43). Referring to results of empirical research, Habermas notes that the deliberative quality of political communication in the internet is still an \"open question\" (p. 40). According to Habermas, the \"platform\" (p. 44) character is what is \"actually new about the new media\" (p. 44). In other words, they enable all potential users to participate in the public sphere as independent authors with equal rights. Political communication no longer depends on traditional journalists or any other expert or institution for professional selection and discursive examination. But the services produced by new, privately owned social media platforms are \"in no way neutral services\" (p. 53). They are driven by the capitalist logic of profit-making that also puts pressure on the \"old media\" to adjust to the new format. According to Habermas, the emancipatory potential of the digital public sphere today is \"\u00fcbert\u00f6nt\" (p. 45, in the sense of dominated) by \"fragmented publics\" (p. 45), \"bubbles\" (p. 62), and \"echo chambers\" (p. 45). Both the basic standards for a rational debate and the inclusiveness of the public sphere are threatened to be lost. The stakes are high: the political integration of modern democracies is at risk. It looks like a reminder of the final paragraphs of his first book on the public sphere and to his Encyclopedia article from the 1960s, when Habermas presents a strategy that includes three proposals to overcome this (newly) alarming decline of the public sphere. The first strategy counts on civic education: Citizens have to learn how to deal with this new technology in a reasonable way; and this may take some time (cf., pp. 46\u201347). The second strategy consists of strong state regulation of the mass media, for example, to force private owners of platforms in an effective way to correct false information or to prevent hate speech. Finally, the third reform strategy is to provide alternatives to the media power of privately owned companies. He proposes an expansion of financial support for state-funded and democratically controlled TV and radio stations (cf., p. 51 and 67), and even for (printed and digital) newspapers that fulfill certain quality standards (cf., p. 67).4 This reform agenda is conservative in that it attempts to carry the media organization of the 1970s into our digital age. In his 1962 book, he glorified the bourgeois public sphere. In his new book, he is again glorifying a media system of the past. I have listed his threefold political reform agenda because it provokes a non-trivial question: How is it possible to regulate the structures of political communication in a way that strengthens enlightened discussions via legislative measures, when such regulations (at least in democracies) have to be the result of (less enlightened) political communication? In the context of this question, it is striking that face-to-face communication gains more relevance in Habermas' theory than before. It is a subtle change. But it has the potential to produce more than just subtle changes to Habermas' final evaluation of the prospects for political reform of the public sphere. In his characterization of elected parliaments Habermas notes that their members \"deliberate and decide together [emphasis in original] according to democratic procedures\" (p. 24). I will not discuss the problematic theory of parliamentarism in the context of this article, but I do want to point to his formulation \"deliberate together [emphasis in original].\" In my understanding, this formulation indicates a normative preference for political communication in social face-to-face constellations, which is typical for interaction in the lifeworld. In a different section of the book, Habermas explicitly praises the deliberative quality of parliamentary decision-making because decisions are made \"face-to-face after democratic deliberations [emphasis in original]\" (p. 102). He also attests to the courts \"comparatively high level of rationality\" (p. 78), which seems not only to be the result of its legal institutionalization but also due to the fact that court hearings and deliberations are held face-to-face. Finally, in his characterization of social movements and a vibrant civil society he emphasizes their \"face-to-face encounters\" (p. 39) in everyday life and public events. In one of the most intriguing sections of the book, Habermas speculates about a changing perception by the users of social media in which the separation between public and private communication is abolished. According to him, a significant part of digital communication today should be understood neither as public nor as private. Rather it is a sphere of communication, which has been reserved until then for private correspondences by letter, that has been bloated to a public existence. It produces a \"peculiar anonymous intimacy\" (p. 62) which Habermas coins a \"Halb\u00f6ffentlichkeit\" (p. 65\u2014semi-public sphere) of echo chambers and filter bubbles.5 However, this speculation puts Habermas in a dilemma. The lifeworld in Habermas' theory is conceptualized as a linguistically organized and culturally transmitted stock of interpretative patterns which form the symbolic core of a society. He introduces the lifeworld as a necessary correlation to the notion of communicative action (see Baynes, 2016, pp. 64\u201370). The dilemma is the following one: On the one hand, Habermas continues to base the considerations in the book on the assumption of the rational potential of the lifeworld, in particular of face-to-face communication even in different social settings. On the other hand, his speculation provides the plausible assumption that under the conditions of the current digital communication infrastructure, there will be a massive unlearning of cognitive and moral In his 1962 book, Habermas that with the of mass media, the of the capitalist and the of the (Habermas, p. This was with a neutralist position about new In his current critique of social media, he can no longer his neutralist position because he his about the sphere with the speculation that communication in such forms has the of limited and (p. moral and cognitive for its This the for Habermas' reform The longer we wait for radical political of the digital infrastructure, the less it is to the support of democratic to the problems of having to them on a we this of we with a more pessimistic than Habermas But Adorno's on mass culture from the again, we should give empirical a second because there are reasons for it be the case that Habermas is in his analysis in the metaphorical language of \"echo chambers\" and Habermas' metaphorical of the term is also He not this term for modern democratic theory.

      "abstract": "The paper explores the question of just war. For nations to wage war, there is a political, social, and moral necessity to justify such war. Consequently, the doctrine of just war then arose to ensure that nations could justify their declarations of war and armed conflict against other nations. However, as is expected, while the doctrine of just war has existed for centuries, it has also elicited debate for as long as it has existed. Rarely have people agreed on what war was just and what exactly being \u201cjust\u201d means. There are questions as to whether the term is not just another political gimmick meant to allow nations to justify the death of millions of people. For example, a war, such as the second world war, that leads to the death of millions of people can be a just war regardless of its justifications on political grounds. Through the analysis of views of various authorities, including classical ones such as St. Thomas and St. Augustus, the paper will illustrate that the concept of any war being just is becoming an outdated precept as war is not consistent with the human need for love, peace, and justice.",

In disciplinary terms this syndrome is manifested in the social sciences/ versus area studies divide from which the post-Soviet is either excluded or equalized with postcolonial discourses. The situation can be described as a general invisibility of the post-Soviet space and its social sciences and scientists for the rest of the world and the refusal of the global North to accept the post-Soviet scholar in the capacity of a rational subject. The reasons for this complex intersection of the post-Soviet, postcolonial and other post-dependence factors are both internal and external, political and epistemic. Following the methodological principles of decolonial option the author analyses such specific elements of the post-Soviet stagnant configuration in knowledge production as the external imperial difference and the double colonial difference, the geo-politics and body-politics of knowledge the way they are reflected in the knowledge production and distribution, paying specific attention to the possible ways out of this epistemic dead-end.",

Invasions of privacy, increasing dataveillance, digital-by-default commercial and civic transactions and the erosion of the democratic sphere are just some of the complex issues in modern societies. Existential questions associated with digital life challenge the individual to come to terms with who they are, as well as their social interactions and realities. In this article, we identify three contemporary normative responses to these complex issues \u2013digital citizenship, digital rights and digital literacy. These three terms capture epistemological and ontological frames that theorise and enact (both in policy and everyday social interactions) how individuals learn to live in digitally mediated societies. The article explores the effectiveness of each in addressing the philosophical, ethical and practical issues raised by datafication, and the limitations of human agency as an overarching goal within these responses. We examine how each response addresses challenges in policy, everyday social life and political rhetoric, tracing the fluctuating uses of these terms and their address to different stakeholders. The article concludes with a series of conceptual and practical \u2018action points\u2019 that might optimise these responses to the benefit of the individual and society.",

      "abstract": "In the global socio-political situation today, where rigid, extreme and radical interpretations of religion are commonly found and widespread, the contribution of Indonesian post-graduate education, especially Islamic higher education, come to the front stage and become a topic of serious discussion. In term of education in Indonesia, there is an unavoidable fact that Islamic education including Islamic higher education is not a new phenomenon. The situation led to the fact that some international Islamic scholars began to consider the Islamic higher education in Indonesia as a potential alternative system of graduate education including religious education and its contents and methods in offering innovation and transformation. This seems to be much more conducive approach and research to local, regional and global community and peace. This article will explain descriptively the long history of Islamic education and its development. It also aims at presenting elaboration on how higher education of indigenous Islam can modify their own teaching and research methodologies to be more relevant to the intellectual development and advancement, especially that of sciences and humanities in particular. The focus will be on: what are the key issues and elements of the Indonesian Islamic higher education leading to significantly change and contribute to the welfare of the nation and mankind, especially on the development of research which seems to illustrate the weakness of previous educational institutions system in Indonesia. Moreover, there is one thing to remember that the worldwide academic community cannot wait for any longer the solution strongly expected to reduce the weakness since development of religious education and Islam in the Middle East, South Asia, and some parts of the Muslim world is not, more or less, promising for the sake of global humanity, prosperity and peace.[Pada situasi sosial-politik global dewasa ini, ketika interpretasi agama yang rigid, ekstrim dan radikal meluas dan mudah dijumpai, kontribusi pendidikan tinggi, khususnya perguruan tinggi Islam, harus tampil dan menjadi bahan diskusi serius. Dalam konteks pendidikan di Indonesia, terdapat fakta tak terbantahkan bahwa pendidikan Islam termasuk pendidikan tinggi Islam, bukanlah hal baru. Situasi di Indonesia ini mendorong akademisi Islam internasional untuk mempertimbangkan pendidikan tinggi Islam sebagai alternatif dalam inovasi dan transformasi pendidikan, baik dalam hal materi ataupun metodologi. Tulisan ini menjelaskan sejarah panjang perkembangan pendidikan Islam. Selain itu, juga mengelaborasi bagaimana sistem pendidikan Islam memodifikasi metode pengajaran dan risetnya agar lebih sesuai dengan perkembangan dan capaian ilmu pengetahuan, khususnya ilmu sosial humaniora dewasa ini. Tulisan ini berfokus pada isu-isu dan unsur-unsur kunci pendidikan tinggi Islam yang sekiranya mampu berkontribusi dalam mewujudkan kesejahteraan umat manusia dan bangsa, khususnya perkembangan riset yang memetakan kelemahan dari sistem pendidikan di Indonesia. Oleh karena itu, satu hal yang harus diingat bahwa komunitas akademik dunia tidak bisa menunggu lebih lama lagi solusi untuk menutupi kekurangan - kekurangan tersebut, terlebih karena perkembangan pendidikan agama dan Islam di Timur Tengah, Asia Selatan, dan wilayah lain dunia Islam tidak terlalu menjanjikan terhadap kemanusiaan, kesejahteraan, dan perdamaian global.]",

      "abstract": "Does neoliberalism matter for cities, urbanization processes, urban governance and policies? How and to what extent? What does this even mean? These questions are important as neoliberalism is a contentious and powerful political project and paradigm. This paper argues that: (1) it may be fruitful to be clearer about the meaning of neoliberalism rather than adopting an encompassing constructivist framework; and (2) that neoliberalism may not explain that much about the current transformation of urbanization processes and cities. Instead, these mechanisms need to be better specified and their limits defined: urban worlds and the urbanization processes of cities do not change all the time, in all ways. Rather than embracing the multiple, ever-changing forms of neoliberalism and the contructivist framework underpinning this position, this paper identifies a set of central points to define neoliberalism by contrast to liberalism, as one possible working definition of neoliberalism. Secondly, it discusses the neoliberalization of cities and urban policies, recognizing that cities change for many reasons, of which neoliberalism is just one.",
