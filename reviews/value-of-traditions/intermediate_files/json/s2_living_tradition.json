      "abstract": "The article considers the issue of the formation of the idea of a Living Tradition in the scientific and social activities of the American scientist Jaroslav Pelikan (1923\u20132006). In the life and intellectual path of a scientist, three stages \u2014 early, middle and late ones \u2014 are conditionally identified. The article shows that the concept of Living Tradition is the result of the development of two sides of Pelican\u2019s life and that the study of the Christian tradition can lead to a change in confessional affiliation. Particular attention is paid to the middle and late periods of his intellectual and spiritual searches, at the stage of which the scientist discovers the heritage of the Ancient Church. The article also highlights the Pelikan\u2019s theological features of the conception of the Living Tradition. Through the idea of a Living Tradition, the scientist reconciles the continuity of the tradition of the Church and the changes within this continuum. The article shows that the conception of Living Tradition is closely connected with the idea of catholicity and continuity of the Church. The author claims that, firstly, the Pelikan, in the idea of Tradition, adopted the language of representatives of the Catholic school of Tubingen and the Orthodox Neo-Patristic school. At the same time, the theological thought of J. Pelikan continues to move within the strict framework of the set research goal \u2014 historical research and justification of continuity and changes in the Church. It is also shown that J. Pelikan\u2019s views on the conception of Living Tradition are largely dictated by his correspondence polemic with his predecessor A. von Harnack. In addition, the article concludes that the Pelikan in his understanding of Tradition is not so sensitive to the Divine within Tradition, understood as the action of the Holy Spirit in the Church. At the end of the article, it is demonstrated that at the late stage of his work, Pelikan fails to fully solve the problem of Tradition. This research can be useful for everyone who is interested in the life and work of modern theologians and Christian historians.",

      "abstract": "The Catholic church\u2019s stance toward human rights has developed dramatically during the 70 years since the UN General Assembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. In this paper, I will first illustrate several of the developments and suggest some reasons why they occurred. Second, I will outline the Catholic community\u2019s significant practical contribution to human rights in recent decades. Finally, I will sketch two areas where further development is happening or needed today: the rights of refugees and the rights of women. Thus, I will illustrate that a \u2018living tradition\u2019 shapes the Catholic approach to human rights. The historian of Christian doctrine Jaroslav Pelikan described a tradition as \u2018the living faith of the dead,\u2019 in contrast with traditionalism, which he called \u2018the dead faith of the living.\u20191 The church\u2019s living commitment to human rights is especially important today. Some commentators maintain today that belief in the importance of human rights is becoming a \u2018dead faith.\u2019 For example, Stephen Hopgood argues that the failure to protect human rights in regions like Cambodia, Rwanda, and Syria means we are in \u2018the endtimes of human rights.\u2019 Yascha Mounk sees the rise of nationalist populism and its often",

It provides a brief overview of the Wesleyan tradition, connects it to personal faith and social duty, emphasizes the Holy Spirit\u2019s role in transforming people and groups, as well as the importance of communal holiness. Through critical analysis and theological reflections, this article demonstrates that key principles in the Wesleyan tradition can inform broader Christian engagement in ethical living and social activism in various contexts, with reference to the lives and examples of William Wilberforce, Martin Luther King Jr, and Florence Nightingale. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that Christians today can work towards a just, diverse, equitable, and inclusive society through an application of the key principles of the Wesleyan tradition.",

It is an activity of togetherness that has profound philosophical meaning. The Tompaso tradition is very different from what is known as Mapalus. Ma'Sembong is one of the auxiliary traditions that are inspired and lived up from one generation to the next generation of the Tompaso community. It may also be from also the philosophy of life of the Minahasa people \"Si Tou Timou Tumou Tou\" and is closely related to the North Sulawesi motto \"Torang Samua Basudara\". They are increasingly echoing in the application of the order of life which refers to mutual cooperation but Ma'Sembong philosophy is more profound than just being together.

However, close examination of his early writings shows that almost all the views he expressed in the 1930s are to be found decades before. Hence, Jabotinsky should be viewed as a thinker who for most of his life held a multifaceted, yet fairly consistent approach to tradition: criticizing Jewish halakha and calling for its reform, while considering religion a great moral force for human progress, describing Jewish tradition as integral to national culture, past and future, and to a certain extent, even romanticizing religious experience. This inclination establishes Jabotinsky as a moderate-secularist easily able to ally himself politically with Religious-Zionists while remaining a non-observant Jew.",

Starting from the interpretive tradition of Leviticus 18:5, intertextuality between the quotation and the surrounding texts is traced along with echoes of Leviticus 18:5 throughout each epistle. It is demonstrated that Paul interpreted Leviticus 18:5 in Galatians in connection to the reward of life. In Romans, on the other hand, Paul interpreted Leviticus 18:5 as the law written on the hearts of those who are in Christ \u2013thus fulfilling its covenantal function. Rather than implying inconsistency, Paul\u2019s different applications of Leviticus 18:5 are consistent with the unity of his view on the law.",

Referring to a multifaceted biblical imagery, the theme of water interweaves elements of well stories, including Moses traditions (especially the gift of water out from the rock in the desert, later parallelized with the gift of the Torah), eschatological hopes (the fountain coming forth from the temple, the outpouring of the spirit), and sapiental images (wisdom and teaching, or the Torah, as fountain of life). Providing the life-giving water, Jesus is presented on the one hand as the \u201cprophet like Moses\u201d depicted in Deut. 18. On the other hand, he acts in the role of Wisdom, who invites those who are thirsty to come. In John 4 as well as in John 7, the gift of the water of life is connected with messiah discourses. While alluding to popular expectations of \u201cthe prophet\u201d and \u201cthe messiah,\u201d the Fourth Gospel\u2019s presentation of the \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f79\u03c2 goes beyond. Integrating the Wisdom strand with the concept of the Logos into its Christology, Jesus is portrayed to be more than a/the prophet.",

And many believe that it was the Roman legal concept of animate law which eventually laid the foundation for the elaboration of the idea of absolute power in the late Middle Ages. If this hypothesis is correct, the philosophic background of some late medieval and early modern absolutistic doctrines of political government could be sought after as early as the classical Greek descriptions of a king who is nomos empsychos, that is, a living law. In this article, I intend to consider this intellectual tradition, and raise some doubts about the merits of the above claim, arguing instead for a separate consideration of the individual sources of the nomos empsychos concept. As such, I am tracing the genealogy of the expression to the fifth-century Pythagorean, Archytas of Tarentum, and I am demonstrating that originally the nomos empsychos was inseparably associated with an intrinsically Archytean tradition.",

Having our point of departure in the Laozi we refer to its paradoxical language as a living riddle that is inherent in the tradition, and as such it suggests a \"model of modeling.\" We find this model in Laozi 25, according to which self-so (ziran \u81ea\u7136) serves as foundation for an ethic that is neither dichotomizing nor resting on human moral conventions, but serves rather as a guiding philosophy of living. On this basis we explore the question of an ethic in the Huang Lao tradition.",

The argument is introduced by highlighting a theological hermeneutic that underlies the Belhar confession\u2019s accompanying letter. This discussion points towards an account of Christian discourse that is \u2018traditioned\u2019 by the past but also moves beyond the mere repetition of the tradition\u2019s authoritative statements. The article, therefore, affirms the need to distinguish between a living tradition and a narrow traditionalism. In addition, the article also interrogates some forms of theological rhetoric in which \u2018tradition\u2019 functions to insert control over spaces and people, often exhibiting totalising discourses and over-triumphant claims.Contribution:\u00a0The conclusion links a hermeneutic of tradition (that sees Christian speech, doctrine and action as \u2018traditioned creativity\u2019) to some metaphors that can further illuminate what it means for a tradition to be open to the future in a way that displays vulnerability and vitality.",
