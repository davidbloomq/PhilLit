## Conclusion

The debate over mechanistic interpretability's necessity and sufficiency for AI safety reflects three interrelated sources of confusion that this review has sought to disentangle: definitional ambiguity about what constitutes mechanistic explanation, underspecified claims about which safety properties are at stake, and limited empirical evidence connecting interpretability methods to safety outcomes.

The philosophy of mechanistic explanation provides substantive resources for addressing definitional confusion. As Piccinini and Craver (2011) demonstrate, functional analyses and mechanistic descriptions complement rather than compete---both narrow construals targeting individual circuits (Olsson et al. 2022; Conmy et al. 2023) and broader construals emphasizing functional organization (Kastner and Crook 2024) can qualify as genuinely mechanistic if they satisfy criteria such as mutual manipulability (Craver, Glennan, and Povich 2021). The apparent disagreement between Hendrycks and Hiscott's (2025) skepticism and Kastner and Crook's (2024) advocacy dissolves once we recognize that multiple mechanistic levels can coexist non-competitively (Povich and Craver 2017). What remains underexplored is systematic application of these philosophical criteria to evaluate current MI methods---Ayonrinde and Jaburi (2025) represents the only sustained attempt to bridge these literatures.

On necessity, the evidence supports conditional rather than categorical conclusions. For threat models involving internal misalignment---particularly deceptive alignment, where models strategically fake compliance during evaluation (Alignment Forum 2024)---behavioral testing appears insufficient, and internal inspection becomes essential. However, for other safety properties such as robustness to distributional shift, London (2019) and Duran and Formanek (2018) demonstrate that reliability-based validation may provide adequate epistemic grounding without mechanistic transparency. Alternative oversight mechanisms including debate (Irving, Christiano, and Amodei 2018) and constitutional AI (Bai et al. 2022) offer paths to alignment that do not presuppose complete interpretability. The necessity of MI thus depends critically on specifying which safety goals are at stake and which threat models are operative---a specification the current debate frequently lacks.

On sufficiency, the evidence is clearer: MI is insufficient as a standalone safety approach. Makelov et al. (2024) demonstrate a significant gap between interpretability and control---sparse autoencoders capture interpretable features but fail to enable reliable intervention. Raji and Dobbe (2023) show that safety failures often stem from deployment context and organizational pressures rather than model internals. Dung and Mai (2025) reveal that failure modes correlate across safety techniques, limiting the effectiveness of defense-in-depth strategies that rely on any single approach. Even complete mechanistic understanding may not translate to control capacity if the understanding does not enable precise intervention.

The most productive framing is therefore pluralistic: different safety goals require different forms of interpretability, or none at all (Zednik 2019; Buchholz 2023; Yao 2021). MI is one tool within a defense-in-depth strategy (Bengio et al. 2025), well-suited for detecting certain internal threats but requiring complementary mechanisms for addressing the full range of safety challenges identified by Amodei et al. (2016) and subsequently expanded by He et al. (2021) and Zheng et al. (2024).

This review contributes to the debate by offering systematic application of philosophical criteria from the mechanism literature to evaluate MI's explanatory status; precise formulation of conditional necessity and sufficiency claims that specify target safety properties; and identification of the empirical evidence needed to resolve remaining disagreements. What emerges is not a verdict for or against MI, but rather a clarification of the conditions under which it proves essential and those under which alternative approaches may suffice---a conditional analysis the field requires to allocate research resources appropriately and to develop realistic expectations about what interpretability research can deliver for AI safety.
