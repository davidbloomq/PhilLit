====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The "new mechanism" literature, emerging in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
fundamentally reoriented philosophy of science away from law-based models of
explanation toward understanding how things work. Machamer, Darden, and Craver's
(2000) foundational paper established mechanisms as organized entities and
activities producing regular changes, spawning extensive work on the structure
of mechanistic explanations. Key debates center on: (1) the relationship between
etiological and constitutive mechanistic explanation (Craver 2007, Krickel 2018),
(2) the nature and metaphysics of mechanistic levels (Craver & Povich 2017,
Povich & Craver 2021), (3) whether constitutive relevance is distinct from
causation (Gillett 2020, Craver et al. 2021), and (4) the scope of mechanistic
explanation beyond biology into physics, psychology, and computation (Felline 2021,
Piccinini & Craver 2011). Recent work (2020-2025) addresses integration with
computational models, mathematical explanation, and applies mechanistic frameworks
to emerging domains like AI interpretability.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the conceptual foundation for evaluating whether mechanistic
interpretability (MI) in machine learning genuinely constitutes "mechanistic"
explanation in the philosophical sense. The debate between Hendrycks & Hiscott
(2025) and Kastner & Crook (2024) over what counts as MI directly parallels
philosophical disputes about levels of mechanism, the grain of mechanistic
decomposition, and whether higher-level functional descriptions qualify as
mechanistic. Understanding constitutive vs. etiological explanation is crucial
for determining whether MI explains how neural networks produce outputs
(constitutive) or merely traces causal pathways (etiological).

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited explicit engagement with machine learning and AI systems as potential
mechanistic systems (Ayonrinde & Jaburi 2025 is a notable exception). Most work
focuses on biological and neuroscientific examples. The relationship between
mechanistic explanation and computational explanation (Piccinini & Craver 2011)
remains underdeveloped for contemporary deep learning architectures.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around three core questions: (1) What makes an explanation mechanistic?
(definitional debates), (2) How do levels of mechanism relate to levels of
explanation? (levels debates), (3) What is the relationship between mechanism
and function? (constitutive vs. functional). Map Hendrycks/Hiscott vs.
Kastner/Crook debate onto these philosophical positions.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Minimal mechanism (MDC 2000, Glennan 2017): 12 papers - Entities, activities, organization
- Levels of mechanism (Craver 2007, Povich & Craver 2017): 6 papers - Constitutive hierarchy
- Mechanism without causation (Gillett 2020, Krickel 2018): 4 papers - Constitutive relevance as sui generis
- Extended mechanism (Bechtel, Felline): 5 papers - Beyond biology, dynamic systems

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the foundational characterization of mechanisms as "entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up to finish or termination conditions." Argues that mechanisms, not laws, are the fundamental explanatory structure in biology and neuroscience, distinguishing productive activities (e.g., binding, opening, attracting) from mere spatial or temporal organization.

  RELEVANCE: This is the founding document of new mechanism philosophy and establishes the minimal requirements for mechanistic explanation. For evaluating MI, it provides criteria: Does MI identify specific entities (neurons, layers, circuits)? Does it specify activities (activation transformations, attention operations)? Does it show how these are organized to produce outputs? The distinction between entities and activities maps onto the debate between circuit-level (Hendrycks/Hiscott) vs. functional-level (Kastner/Crook) MI approaches.

  POSITION: Foundational "new mechanism" paper that defines the minimal structure of mechanistic explanation. All subsequent mechanism literature responds to or builds on this characterization.

  year = {2007},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299317.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops the distinction between constitutive and etiological mechanistic explanation and introduces the hierarchical account of mechanistic levels. Argues that constitutive explanations reveal how a phenomenon is "built up" from organized component parts and activities at lower levels, while etiological explanations trace causal histories. Proposes mutual manipulability as the criterion for constitutive relevance: components are constitutively relevant to a mechanism's behavior if interventions on components change the mechanism's behavior and vice versa.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the central question for MI: what level of decomposition counts as mechanistic? Craver's levels are defined by part-whole relations, not by spatial scale or disciplinary boundaries. This framework is essential for adjudicating whether MI must decompose to individual neurons/activations (Hendrycks/Hiscott) or whether higher-level functional decompositions (attention heads, circuits with functional roles) qualify as legitimate mechanistic levels. The mutual manipulability criterion provides an empirical test for whether MI identifies genuine mechanistic components.

  POSITION: Canonical neurophilosophy work establishing constitutive mechanistic explanation and hierarchical levels as central to neuroscience explanation. Foundational for debates about interlevel causation and reduction.

  title = {Discovering Complexity: Decomposition and Localization as Strategies in Scientific Research},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  year = {2010},
  edition = {2nd},
  doi = {10.7551/mitpress/8328.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes decomposition and localization as heuristic strategies for discovering mechanisms, distinguishing between direct decomposition (which succeeds when systems are near-decomposable) and cases requiring consideration of complex interactions, nonlinear dynamics, and reorganization. Shows how mechanistic research can fail when systems are not modular or when important operations occur at multiple levels simultaneously.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding the limits of mechanistic explanation and when decomposition strategies succeed or fail. Neural networks may exemplify the "complex systems" where simple decomposition fails—distributed representations, nonlinear interactions, and emergent computations challenge straightforward localization. This provides theoretical grounding for Kastner & Crook's (2024) concern that low-level MI may miss higher-level functional organization. Bechtel's emphasis on "looking around" (understanding horizontal organization) not just "looking down" (vertical decomposition) supports functional-level MI approaches.

  POSITION: Establishes the conditions under which mechanistic decomposition succeeds and the importance of attending to organizational complexity beyond simple part-whole hierarchies.

  journal = {Philosophy of Science},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {69},
  number = {S3},
  pages = {S366--S377},
  doi = {10.1086/341859},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a counterfactual account of mechanisms emphasizing invariance under interventions rather than productive activities. Mechanisms consist of parts whose behavior conforms to generalizations that are invariant under interventions and which are organized in modular ways. This shifts focus from activities to patterns of counterfactual dependence.

  RELEVANCE: Woodward's interventionist framework underlies Craver's mutual manipulability criterion and connects mechanism to causal inference methods. For MI, this suggests that mechanistic understanding requires not just descriptive models but the ability to predict how interventions on components (ablation, activation patching) affect overall behavior. The invariance requirement raises questions about whether MI explanations generalize across different inputs, training procedures, or architectures—a key sufficiency question.

  POSITION: Alternative to MDC's activity-based account, emphasizing modularity, invariance, and counterfactual reasoning. Influential for connecting mechanisms to interventionist causation.

  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198779711.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Synthesizes two decades of mechanism literature into a unified philosophical framework, defending minimal mechanism ("entities whose activities and interactions are organized to produce regular changes") while addressing metaphysical implications for causation, laws, natural kinds, and reduction. Argues that mechanisms are ontologically fundamental and that laws, when they exist, describe regularities in mechanistic processes rather than governing them.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most comprehensive philosophical treatment of mechanisms to date and explicitly addresses how mechanistic explanation extends beyond biology to chemistry, physics, psychology, and social sciences. For MI, Glennan's framework offers resources for defending MI as genuinely mechanistic even if neural networks differ from biological paradigms. His discussion of complex mechanisms with emergent properties and his rejection of strict reductionism support more pluralistic approaches to mechanistic levels in ML.

  POSITION: Systematic defense of mechanism as a general metaphysical framework, not merely an epistemic tool. Argues for ontological priority of mechanisms over laws and for pluralism about mechanistic explanation.

  volume = {2},
  number = {1},
  pages = {119--135},
  doi = {10.1007/s13194-011-9038-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys diverse characterizations of mechanism across disciplines and proposes a minimal general characterization: "A mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities and activities organized such that they produce the phenomenon." Emphasizes that this minimal account applies across sciences (biology, medicine, social science, physics) while allowing for discipline-specific elaborations. Argues against overly restrictive definitions that privilege particular scientific domains.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that mechanistic explanation is not limited to molecular biology or neuroscience but spans multiple scientific domains with varying ontologies and methodologies. This pluralism is crucial for defending MI as mechanistic despite differences from biological paradigms. The paper's cross-disciplinary survey shows that what counts as an "entity," "activity," or "organization" varies by domain—suggesting that debates over MI's mechanistic status should focus on functional roles rather than superficial similarities to biological mechanisms.

  POSITION: Minimal, pluralistic account of mechanism designed to accommodate diverse scientific practices. Influential for extending mechanism beyond life sciences.

  year = {2017},
  pages = {185--197},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315731544.CH14},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Clarifies the notion of mechanistic levels as constitutive part-whole hierarchies distinct from realization, spatial scale, or disciplinary levels. Argues that mechanistic levels support a non-reductive but still physicalist metaphysics: higher-level phenomena are "nothing over and above" lower-level mechanisms yet remain scientifically autonomous because they are described at different levels of mechanistic organization. Emergence is reconciled with mechanism through constitutive explanation without reduction.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding debates about "levels" in MI. Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025) appear to assume that mechanistic explanation requires decomposition to the finest-grained level (individual activations), while Kastner & Crook (2024) work at higher functional levels (attention heads, circuits). Povich & Craver show that multiple mechanistic levels can coexist non-competitively—what matters is whether each level identifies genuine part-whole mechanistic structure. This supports pluralism: both low-level and high-level MI can be mechanistic if they identify appropriate mechanistic levels.

  POSITION: Defends mechanistic levels as constitutive hierarchies and argues for compatibility between mechanistic explanation and emergence without strong reduction.

  volume = {199},
  pages = {8807--8828},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-021-03183-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to critics (especially Baumgartner, Casini, and Krickel) who argue that interventions on constitutively related variables are impossible, thus undermining mutual manipulability as a criterion for constitutive relevance. Defends a revised account where constitutive relevance can be evidenced through top-down and bottom-up experimental interventions that exploit "causal betweenness"—components are constitutively relevant when they mediate between inputs and outputs of the mechanism.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses methodological questions about how to empirically establish mechanistic structure. For MI, this has immediate implications: ablation studies, activation patching, and causal interventions in neural networks can provide evidence for mechanistic structure by showing how components mediate input-output mappings. However, the "causal betweenness" criterion may conflate constitutive and causal explanation—a tension that affects whether MI identifies how networks compute (constitutive) or merely which components affect outputs (causal).

  POSITION: Revised interventionist account of constitutive relevance that attempts to reconcile mutual manipulability with metaphysical constraints on constitution. Central to ongoing debates about interlevel causation.

  volume = {83},
  pages = {1039--1061},
  doi = {10.1007/s10670-017-9913-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes four types of mechanistic explanation by crossing two dimensions: etiological vs. constitutive and input-output vs. dimensional. Argues that these types have different ontological implications—constitutive explanations invoke part-whole relations while etiological explanations invoke causal relations—and that failure to distinguish them has generated confusion about whether mechanisms involve causation across levels.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a taxonomy for classifying MI explanations. Circuit-level MI that traces how information flows from input through intermediate activations to output appears to be etiological (causal pathway), while functional decomposition that shows how attention mechanisms constitute the network's capacity for contextual processing appears constitutive. Understanding this distinction is crucial for evaluating whether MI provides the right kind of explanation for understanding neural network behavior—constitutive explanations answer "how is this capacity realized?" while etiological explanations answer "what caused this output?"

  POSITION: Taxonomic refinement of mechanistic explanation types with metaphysical implications for the nature of mechanistic relations.

  volume = {57},
  number = {4},
  pages = {337--352},
  doi = {10.2307/48570644},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues against "neo-Causalism" (the view that all ontic scientific explanations are causal explanations) by showing that constitutive mechanistic explanations—which explain wholes by parts—involve compositional relations that are categorically distinct from causal relations. Treating composition as causal or causation-like is a category mistake. Thus Salmon's "New Consensus" must be revised to recognize constitutive explanation as a sui generis form of ontic explanation.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the assumption that mechanistic explanation must trace causal pathways, arguing instead that constitutive explanation is fundamentally different. For MI, this raises the question: Are circuit-level explanations that trace activation flows causal explanations (thus not genuinely mechanistic in the constitutive sense), while functional decompositions that show how network capacities are realized by organized components are genuinely constitutive mechanistic explanations? This would favor Kastner & Crook's approach over purely causal tracing methods.

  POSITION: Metaphysical argument that constitutive mechanistic explanation is sui generis, not a species of causal explanation. Challenges interventionist accounts that reduce constitution to causation.

  pages = {533--543},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315623818-44},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the applicability of mechanistic explanation to physics, arguing that while some physical domains (e.g., classical mechanics, optics) support mechanistic reasoning, others (e.g., quantum mechanics, thermodynamics) resist it. Defends the view that mechanistic explanation, properly understood as showing "how things work" through entities, activities, and processes, complements law-based explanation in physics rather than replacing it.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that mechanistic explanation extends beyond biology to physical sciences, with important caveats about domain-specific constraints. For MI in computational systems, Felline's analysis suggests that mechanistic explanation should focus on computational processes (how information is transformed) rather than merely on physical substrate (silicon chips, electricity). This supports functional-level MI: just as mechanistic explanation in physics focuses on field interactions and energy transformations (not fundamental particles), MI should focus on computational operations (attention, feedforward transformations) not merely on activation patterns.

  POSITION: Domain-sensitive account of mechanistic explanation that defends its application to physics while recognizing limits. Argues for pluralism about explanatory frameworks.

  volume = {183},
  pages = {283--311},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-011-9898-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that functional analyses in psychology (decomposing cognitive capacities into subfunctions) are mechanism sketches that abstract away from implementation details while retaining mechanistic structure. These sketches are integrated with neuroscientific mechanistic explanations through a multilevel framework where psychological functions specify what the mechanism does and neuroscience reveals how it does it. Functional analysis and mechanistic explanation are complementary, not competing.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the MI debate: Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025) prioritize implementation details (activations, neurons) while Kastner & Crook (2024) emphasize functional analysis (what circuits compute). Piccinini & Craver show these are different levels of the same mechanistic hierarchy—functional analysis identifies higher-level mechanistic organization, not a non-mechanistic alternative. This vindicates functional-level MI as genuinely mechanistic, provided it specifies organized components and their contributions to overall capacities.

  POSITION: Integrative account showing how functional analysis and mechanistic explanation work together in cognitive neuroscience. Defends functional description as a legitimate mechanistic level.

  volume = {53},
  pages = {84--93},
  doi = {10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.03.006},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses tension between mechanistic explanation (which assumes discrete levels and localized operations) and scale-free phenomena (which exhibit similar patterns across multiple spatial/temporal scales without privileged levels). Argues that mechanistic explanation can accommodate scale-free dynamics by recognizing that mechanisms themselves can exhibit non-decomposable organization, requiring dynamic systems modeling alongside decomposition.

  RELEVANCE: Neural networks may exhibit scale-free or distributed dynamics that resist clean decomposition into discrete mechanistic levels—attention patterns, distributed representations, and emergent computations span multiple scales. Bechtel's framework suggests MI should combine mechanistic decomposition (identifying components) with dynamic analysis (understanding how components interact across scales). This supports pluralism: purely circuit-level MI may miss scale-free dynamics, while purely functional descriptions may miss implementational constraints.

  POSITION: Extends mechanistic framework to accommodate complex dynamics and scale-free phenomena, arguing for integration with dynamic systems approaches.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the puzzle of interlevel causation in mechanisms: if higher-level phenomena are constituted by lower-level components (part-whole relation), can there be genuine causation between levels, or does this violate the principle that causes and effects must be distinct? Defends limited interlevel causation by distinguishing between causation (diachronic, between distinct events) and constitution (synchronic, part-whole relation), arguing that higher-level states can cause changes in component states without metaphysical incoherence.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding whether MI should trace causal influence between levels (e.g., does layer 5 "cause" layer 6 activations?) or constitutive relations (does layer 5 help constitute the network's overall computation?). Krickel's framework suggests these are distinct explanatory projects with different metaphysical commitments. Confusion between them may underlie disagreements about what MI should explain.

  doi = {10.1007/s11229-015-0844-8},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the assumption that a single complete mechanistic model provides the ideal explanation. Instead, argues that mechanistic understanding is distributed across multiple partial models that emphasize different components, levels, or aspects of the mechanism. No single model captures the complete mechanism; rather, explanatory understanding emerges from integrating complementary perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Suggests that debates about whether MI should be low-level (Hendrycks/Hiscott) or high-level (Kastner/Crook) may pose a false dichotomy. Different MI approaches—circuit analysis, causal tracing, functional decomposition—may provide complementary partial mechanistic models that together constitute understanding. This pluralistic framework supports integrating multiple MI methodologies rather than declaring one approach uniquely correct.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the tension between detail and generality in mechanistic explanation—more detailed models capture specific instances better but generalize poorly, while more general models sacrifice mechanistic detail for broader applicability. Argues that the appropriate balance depends on explanatory goals and that both detailed mechanism schemas and abstract mechanistic generalizations play legitimate explanatory roles.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to evaluating MI approaches: low-level circuit analysis provides detailed mechanistic models of specific networks but may not generalize across architectures or tasks, while functional-level analysis provides more general mechanistic schemas (e.g., "attention mechanisms") that apply broadly but with less implementational detail. Matthewson's framework suggests that both serve different explanatory purposes—detailed MI for understanding specific models, general MI for cross-model understanding.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies philosophy of mechanistic explanation directly to mechanistic interpretability in machine learning, arguing that MI research constitutes a principled approach to understanding neural networks because networks contain "implicit explanations" that can be extracted. Proposes that MI produces model-level, ontic, causal-mechanistic, and falsifiable explanations. Introduces the "Principle of Explanatory Optimism"—the conjecture that neural networks are sufficiently structured to support mechanistic explanation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive treatment of mechanistic discovery in biology, focusing on heuristic strategies scientists use to find, characterize, and evaluate mechanistic hypotheses. Emphasizes that mechanism discovery is not mere induction but involves sophisticated reasoning strategies: forward/backward chaining, schema instantiation, modular subassembly, and constraint satisfaction. Mechanistic reasoning guides experimental design, model construction, and theory evaluation across biological subdisciplines.

  RELEVANCE: Provides methodological framework for how scientists discover mechanisms, directly applicable to MI research practices. MI researchers use analogous strategies: forward activation tracing, backward gradient analysis, modular circuit identification, and iterative refinement through ablation experiments. Understanding these as mechanistic discovery heuristics (rather than ad hoc methods) strengthens the case that MI constitutes systematic mechanistic investigation. Also highlights that mechanistic understanding develops progressively through partially specified mechanism sketches, not all-at-once complete models.
