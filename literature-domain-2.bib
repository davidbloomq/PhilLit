DOMAIN: Agentic Markets and Multi-Agent Systems
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-12
PAPERS_FOUND: 16 (High: 7, Medium: 6, Low: 3)

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Agentic markets are economic environments where autonomous AI agents transact,
negotiate, and allocate resources on behalf of human principals or organizations.
This domain encompasses technical work on multi-agent systems in economic contexts,
including trading bots, procurement agents, automated negotiation systems, and
agent-based market simulation. Key developments include double auction mechanisms
with software agents, automated market makers, supply chain coordination through
agent systems, and platforms for agent-based trading (including recent developments
in LLM-based agentic markets). Research addresses both technical challenges
(coordination, strategic behavior, efficiency) and design questions (information
structures, matching mechanisms, regulation). The field draws on economics,
computer science, and artificial intelligence.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain establishes what agentic markets actually are, how they function,
and what technical capabilities current AI agents possess in economic contexts.
Understanding the practical reality of agentic markets is essential for applying
procedural experimentalism—we need to know what procedural variations are
technically feasible and what moral pathologies might arise in actual systems.
This domain provides concrete instantiation of the abstract normative questions
the research addresses.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
Rapid advancement in last 5 years with large language model-based agents showing
sophisticated negotiation and strategic behavior. Increased deployment in
real-world contexts (algorithmic trading, procurement, energy markets). Growing
attention to multi-agent coordination and emergence of complex market dynamics
from agent interactions. Platforms like AutoGen and recent agentic marketplace
simulators enable controlled experimentation.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most work focuses on efficiency, coordination, or strategic behavior optimization.
Limited attention to normative dimensions like fairness, accountability, or
legitimacy of agent-mediated transactions. Technical literature rarely engages
with philosophical questions about representation, moral agency, or procedural
justification. Gap between technical capability and normative evaluation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on papers that describe concrete agentic market implementations and
multi-agent economic systems. Balance technical descriptions with attention
to normative implications. Emphasize recent LLM-based agent work that shows
increased autonomy and strategic sophistication. Connect technical capabilities
to questions about procedural justification and moral pathologies.

- Multi-agent trading systems: 5 papers - Auction mechanisms, market platforms
- Automated negotiation: 3 papers - Agent negotiation strategies and protocols
- Agent-based market simulation: 3 papers - Computational modeling of markets
- LLM-based agentic markets: 2 papers - Recent AI agent capabilities
