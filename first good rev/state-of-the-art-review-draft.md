## Introduction

The rise of **agentic markets**—economic exchanges where autonomous AI agents transact, negotiate, and allocate resources on behalf of humans—represents a significant transformation in how economic activity is organized and governed. Examples of emerging agentic markets span diverse domains: autonomous trading bots optimizing investment portfolios across decentralized exchanges, procurement agents negotiating prices and delivery terms for firms, energy-grid optimizers dynamically buying and selling electricity on behalf of households, and AI consumer representatives that compare products and execute purchases according to users' sustainability preferences or ethical commitments. In each case, AI agents interact in rule-governed environments, forming economic orders whose fairness and legitimacy depend fundamentally on procedural design choices embedded in market rules, information disclosure requirements, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

These agentic markets give rise to novel normative challenges that resist resolution through traditional approaches in political philosophy. Armchair reflection about justice in markets typically assumes human participants engaged in face-to-face exchange or, at minimum, direct human decision-making about economic transactions. Purely outcome-based evaluation—judging markets solely by distributive consequences—fails to capture procedural dimensions of fairness that may be especially salient when decision-makers are algorithmic rather than human. Moreover, seemingly innocuous design principles can lead to unanticipated harms difficult to predict from abstract reasoning alone. Autonomous negotiation systems may develop strategies that exploit human cognitive biases or tacitly collude with other agents to manipulate prices. Consumer-representative agents might prioritize efficiency over fairness, systematically disadvantaging small producers or eroding market trust through opaque decision-making. Financial trading agents could amplify market volatility or engage in adversarial tactics exceeding the pathologies of human high-frequency trading.

Recent work by Adams and Himmelreich (2023, 2024) offers a promising alternative framework: **procedural experimentalism**. On this view, certain decision-making procedures involving social experimentation can justify mid-level normative principles not through armchair argument but through structured learning under conditions of uncertainty and reasonable disagreement. Social experiments become sites of moral learning where institutions test and refine principles under real constraints. While Adams and Himmelreich develop this framework for human institutions, agentic markets present an opportunity to extend procedural experimentalism to a new domain while addressing an urgent practical challenge: we can experiment with agentic markets before deploying them at scale, using simulation platforms like Magentic Marketplace to test institutional designs in controlled environments where all participants are synthetic agents.

This literature review examines the state-of-the-art across multiple domains to establish both the theoretical foundations and the practical tools needed for this research agenda. We synthesize work from political philosophy (procedural experimentalism and procedural justice), AI ethics (agency, responsibility, value alignment), economics and computer science (market design and multi-agent systems), algorithmic governance (fairness, accountability, transparency), institutional theory (moral learning), and philosophy of science (simulation methodology). Our review reveals that while rich literatures exist within each domain, critical gaps remain at their intersections—particularly concerning how to evaluate AI-mediated institutions through experimental methods.

The review is structured as follows. **Section 1** establishes philosophical foundations, examining procedural experimentalism as an alternative to armchair political philosophy and procedural justice as a normative framework independent of outcomes. **Section 2** addresses the ethical status of AI agents, focusing on debates about moral agency, responsibility gaps, and value alignment challenges that intensify in multi-agent contexts. **Section 3** turns to market design and multi-agent coordination, exploring how institutional rules shape outcomes and examining emergent behaviors in systems where multiple AI agents interact strategically. **Section 4** analyzes algorithmic governance, reviewing standards for legitimate automation including fairness requirements, transparency obligations, and meaningful human control. **Section 5** examines moral learning in institutions and the epistemology of simulation, justifying experimental approaches using computational models for normative inquiry. **Section 6** synthesizes findings to identify critical research gaps and position the proposed research. A brief conclusion follows.

By mapping the current state-of-the-art across these domains, we demonstrate that agentic markets represent a novel challenge requiring integration of insights from political philosophy, AI ethics, and mechanism design. Existing frameworks provide essential building blocks but leave unaddressed fundamental questions about procedural justification in AI-mediated institutions. This review establishes the foundation for research using social experiments to generate normative knowledge about how to design fair, legitimate, and trustworthy agentic markets.

## 1. Philosophical Foundations: Procedural Experimentalism and Justice

Contemporary political philosophy faces a methodological challenge: how should normative theories of justice and legitimacy engage with empirical inquiry and institutional design under conditions of uncertainty? This section examines two interconnected responses. **Procedural experimentalism** holds that social experiments can justify normative principles through structured moral learning rather than armchair reasoning alone. **Procedural justice** maintains that the fairness of institutional procedures has independent normative significance beyond the outcomes they produce. Both frameworks provide essential foundations for evaluating agentic markets, yet both require extension to contexts where AI agents mediate human interactions.

### 1.1 From Dewey to Adams & Himmelreich: Experimental Method in Political Philosophy

The idea that experimentation can generate moral knowledge has deep roots in American pragmatism. John Dewey argued that democratic institutions should be understood as sites of experimental inquiry where publics form around problematic situations and test solutions through collective action (*The Public and Its Problems*, 1927). On Dewey's view, knowledge of political values emerges from experience and experimentation, not a priori reasoning. Moral principles are better conceived as hypotheses to be tested through their consequences in practice rather than fixed absolutes derived from philosophical reflection (*Human Nature and Conduct*, 1922). Institutions embody accumulated moral learning—habits and rules that have proven valuable through experience. Moral progress requires treating ethical principles as subject to revision based on observable results.

This pragmatist experimentalism largely fell dormant in mid-20th century political philosophy, which oriented toward ideal theory focused on identifying principles of justice through conceptual analysis (Rawls 1971) or contractualist argument. Recent work revives experimental themes. Elizabeth Anderson (2014, 2016) argues that moral progress often comes through "experiments in living"—social movements and alternative institutions that test new forms of social organization and generate moral knowledge unavailable through argument alone. Her analysis of the abolition movement shows how experiencing alternative social arrangements enables people to revise previously held beliefs about human nature and moral possibility. Moral learning is collective and empirical: we learn by doing, observing consequences, and adjusting institutions accordingly.

The most developed contemporary framework is Adams and Himmelreich's (2023, 2024) **procedural experimentalism**. They argue that social experiments can *justify* mid-level normative principles (not merely test their efficacy) when structured to embody fair deliberative processes. Three conditions are crucial: (1) experiments should involve affected parties or their legitimate representatives, (2) experimental design should enable learning under uncertainty where reasonable disagreement exists about what justice requires, and (3) procedures governing the experiment must themselves be fair (transparent, accountable, revisable based on feedback). When these conditions hold, experimental processes have procedural legitimacy and outcomes possess a form of justification unavailable through armchair theorizing.

Adams (2024) further develops how institutions serve as sites of moral learning when they incorporate feedback mechanisms allowing participants to revise principles based on experience. Institutional experimentation enables learning that pure reflection cannot provide, especially under conditions of reasonable disagreement about values. Rather than seeking consensus on ultimate principles, we test institutional designs and observe their consequences for all affected parties. This learning process has epistemic advantages: it surfaces considerations invisible to abstract reasoning, reveals unintended effects of principled designs, and enables adaptation to particularity and context.

Himmelreich (2022) usefully distinguishes social experiments from thought experiments. Thought experiments explore conceptual possibilities through imaginative variation—classic examples include Rawls's original position or Thomson's trolley cases. Social experiments, by contrast, are *empirical tests* of institutional arrangements under real uncertainty. They have distinct epistemic virtues: revealing unanticipated consequences of institutional rules, testing feasibility of proposed arrangements, and demonstrating that alternatives to status quo institutions are possible. When we face uncertainty about how institutional designs will affect people in practice, social experiments can provide knowledge unobtainable through armchair methods.

Recent work extends these themes in complementary directions. Frega, Maesschalck, and Herzog (2022) combine Dewey's experimentalism with contemporary institutional design in their account of *pragmatist democracy*. Democratic institutions should be understood as learning systems that evolve through experimental inquiry. This requires iteration between setting goals, implementing institutional designs, monitoring outcomes, and revising approaches. The value of democracy lies partly in its capacity for error correction and adaptation through inclusive deliberation.

Yet procedural experimentalism faces important objections. David Estlund (2020) argues in *Utopophobia* that while political philosophy should engage feasibility constraints, pure experimentalism may not settle fundamental normative questions. Some moral truths may not be learnable through experience alone—they may require philosophical argument about fundamental values. Over-reliance on experimentation risks "utopophobia" (excessive concern with what's currently feasible) or sliding into mere conservatism (accepting existing practices just because they've persisted). Estlund defends "aspirational realism" combining normative ambition with empirical engagement, but remains skeptical that experiments can fully determine principles of justice.

Laura Valentini's (2012) analysis of ideal versus non-ideal theory clarifies what's at stake. Ideal theory asks what justice ultimately requires under favorable conditions (full compliance, ideal institutions, sound moral motivation). Non-ideal theory addresses what to do given actual circumstances (partial compliance, imperfect institutions, mixed motives). Experimental approaches typically operate in non-ideal theory space. Magentic simulations, for instance, test institutional designs given realistic assumptions about agent behavior and constraints. This leaves open whether experiments can determine ideal justice or only guide institutional reform under non-ideal conditions.

These debates establish procedural experimentalism's promise and limits. Experimentation offers epistemic advantages under uncertainty and disagreement—precisely the conditions facing agentic market design. When we cannot predict from armchair reasoning how market rules will affect fairness or what emergent behaviors will arise from agent interactions, controlled experiments become essential. Yet experimentation may not resolve all normative questions. Some require philosophical argument about which values should govern markets, what fairness fundamentally requires, or how to weigh competing normative considerations. Procedural experimentalism provides a framework for justifying institutional principles through structured learning, but philosophical reflection remains necessary for identifying which questions experiments can answer.

**Gap**: Adams and Himmelreich's framework addresses human institutions where affected parties can directly participate in or observe experiments. Agentic markets involve AI agents as participants, with humans as indirect stakeholders whose interests agents represent. This raises questions about how procedural experimentalism's conditions (involving affected parties, fair deliberative processes) should be adapted when mediating agents stand between humans and experimental sites. Can synthetic agents in simulations serve as legitimate proxies for human participants? What forms of human involvement ensure experiments retain procedural legitimacy?

### 1.2 Procedural Justice: The Independent Value of Fair Procedures

Even if we accept that experimentation can contribute to normative justification, we need substantive standards for evaluating institutional procedures. **Procedural justice theory** provides such standards, examining when and why the fairness of decision-making processes matters independent of outcomes.

John Rawls's (1971, 1974) foundational distinction identifies three types of procedural justice. **Perfect procedural justice** exists when we have an independent criterion for just outcomes and a procedure guaranteed to achieve it (e.g., equal division achieved by "you cut, I choose"). **Imperfect procedural justice** involves an independent outcome criterion with procedures that tend toward but don't guarantee just results (e.g., criminal trials aiming at convicting the guilty and acquitting the innocent). **Pure procedural justice** arises when outcomes are just simply by virtue of fair procedures being followed—there's no independent outcome criterion (Rawls's example: fair gambling where any distribution resulting from fair play is just).

This typology matters for agentic market evaluation. If markets instantiate pure procedural justice, then outcomes are fair by definition when market rules are fair—we need only assess procedural fairness, not distributive patterns. If markets instead exemplify imperfect procedural justice, we must evaluate both procedures and outcomes, asking whether market mechanisms reliably produce fair distributions given legitimate background conditions.

Lawrence Solum (2004) develops another crucial distinction between **intrinsic** and **instrumental** procedural justice. Instrumental procedural justice values procedures as means to just outcomes—fair procedures matter because they tend to produce fair results. Intrinsic procedural justice holds that certain procedural features (participation, voice, transparency, equal treatment) are valuable in themselves, independent of outcomes. Solum argues both dimensions matter, but in different ways. When stakes are high and outcomes uncertain, instrumental considerations dominate—we want procedures likely to reach correct decisions. But procedural fairness also has non-instrumental value: being treated with respect, having voice in decisions affecting you, and experiencing decision-processes as fair contribute to legitimacy even when outcomes disappoint.

Ronald Dworkin's (1981) egalitarian theory develops sophisticated procedural arguments about markets. His "envy test" and auction-based approach treat markets as potentially fair procedural mechanisms for allocating resources when background conditions are right: equal initial resources, no monopoly power, full information, and no exploitation of vulnerabilities. Markets can serve distributive justice when properly designed and embedded in fair background institutions. This suggests procedural fairness in markets depends heavily on background conditions—what information is available, whether power differentials exist, whether participants can meaningfully exit if terms are unfair.

Recent work addresses how procedural justice applies to contemporary political challenges. Thomas Christiano (2023) argues that legitimate political authority requires procedurally fair decision-making treating citizens as equals, not merely outcomes that happen to be just. Procedural fairness is non-instrumentally valuable and necessary for legitimacy. When institutions make decisions affecting people, those people have claims to procedural protections even when decision-makers have good intentions. This has direct implications for agentic markets: if market mechanisms make decisions affecting humans (what prices to accept, which sellers to favor, how to allocate scarce resources), procedural legitimacy requires processes treating affected humans as equals even when AI agents are the immediate decision-makers.

Lara Buchak's (2017) analysis of the "proxy problem" proves especially relevant. When procedures use proxies—indirect measures standing in for what truly matters—procedural justice requires those proxies be justified to affected parties. Mere statistical accuracy isn't sufficient; legitimacy requires explicability and public justification of why specific proxies are used. Applied to agentic markets: AI agents use proxies for human values (utility functions, preference models, satisfaction scores). Buchak's framework suggests procedural fairness requires these proxies be justifiable, not merely predictively accurate. Users must be able to understand and reasonably accept how agents model their interests.

Niko Kolodny (2014) offers a relational egalitarian justification for procedural fairness. Democracy is justified not primarily by producing good outcomes but by avoiding relations of domination—no one should be subject to another's arbitrary will. Procedural structures matter because they constitute relationships among persons. Applied to agentic markets: if AI agents make decisions for humans, do humans become subject to arbitrary algorithmic rule? Procedural protections (appeal mechanisms, transparency about agent strategies, oversight by human regulators, ability to override agent decisions) may be needed to prevent domination even by non-human decision-makers.

Critical perspectives highlight proceduralism's limits. Frederick Schauer (2018) argues procedural justice has bounds—sometimes outcomes matter more than process, especially when procedures are costly or outcomes involve severe harms. Over-emphasis on procedural fairness can be fetishistic, distracting from substantive injustice. If market outcomes are systematically unjust (concentrating wealth, harming vulnerable populations, eroding social trust), procedural fairness alone cannot legitimate them. Richard Arneson (2003) defends pure instrumentalism: democratic procedures are valuable only to the extent they produce substantively just outcomes. Fair procedures with unjust outcomes have no legitimacy.

These debates reveal tensions in evaluating agentic markets. Procedural fairness clearly matters—the *how* of market decision-making affects legitimacy. Markets making decisions through opaque algorithms, without human oversight, using unjustifiable proxies for human interests, or treating participants unequally raise procedural justice concerns even if outcomes are distributively acceptable. Yet procedural fairness isn't the only consideration. If market procedures are scrupulously fair but outcomes systematically disadvantage vulnerable populations or concentrate power, substantive injustice remains. Evaluation requires both procedural and outcome assessment.

Empirical work by Tom Tyler (2000) and others supports the independent importance of procedural fairness. People care about how decisions are made, not just outcomes. Perceived procedural justice increases compliance, legitimacy perceptions, and institutional trust, even when outcomes are personally unfavorable. This has practical implications: agentic markets may need strong procedural protections (transparency, participation in rule-setting, appeal rights, equal treatment) to achieve perceived legitimacy, regardless of distributive outcomes.

**Gap**: Procedural justice theory addresses either direct human participation (Christiano, Kolodny) or algorithmic systems deciding *for* humans (Buchak on proxies). Agentic markets involve AI agents deciding *on behalf of* humans as fiduciaries or representatives. This representative relationship is normatively distinct from both direct participation and algorithmic replacement of human decision-makers. What does procedural fairness require when AI agents represent diverse human interests in competitive market environments? How should we assess whether agent-mediated procedures treat represented humans fairly? These questions remain under-theorized.

### Section 1 Summary

Procedural experimentalism and procedural justice provide complementary foundations for evaluating agentic markets. Adams and Himmelreich establish that social experiments can justify normative principles through structured moral learning under uncertainty. Procedural justice theory shows that fairness of institutional procedures matters independent of outcomes, though tensions exist between procedural and substantive standards. Both frameworks were developed for human institutions with direct human participation. Extending them to agentic markets—where AI agents are experimental participants and represent human interests—requires addressing novel questions about proxy legitimacy, representative fairness, and how procedural experimentalism's conditions should be adapted for AI-mediated institutional contexts.

## 2. AI Agency, Moral Responsibility, and Value Alignment

Agentic markets depend on autonomous AI systems that make consequential economic decisions. Understanding the ethical status of these agents proves essential for determining accountability structures and design requirements. This section examines three interconnected challenges: whether AI agents possess moral agency (and if so, what kind), how responsibility distributes when autonomous systems cause harms, and how to align AI behavior with human values in multi-agent contexts.

### 2.1 Moral Agency and Responsibility Gaps

A foundational debate concerns whether AI systems can be moral agents or remain mere instruments. Floridi and Sanders (2004) defend a *minimalist* conception of artificial moral agency. On their view, systems qualify as moral agents when they exhibit three features: interactivity (responding to environmental stimuli), autonomy (making decisions without direct human control), and adaptability (learning and changing behavior based on experience). This doesn't require consciousness, emotions, or phenomenal states—only capacity for rule-governed autonomous decision-making. By these criteria, sophisticated AI agents in markets likely qualify as moral agents, since they interact with other agents, make independent trading decisions, and adapt strategies through learning.

Others reject attributing moral agency to AI. Joanna Bryson (2018) argues forcefully that AI systems are and should remain artifacts designed to serve human purposes. Treating them as moral patients (deserving moral consideration) or moral agents (bearing moral responsibility) obscures human accountability and enables responsibility shifting. The real ethical issues concern human designers' choices and power structures AI systems instantiate. Similarly, Johnson and Miller (2008) contend that AI systems aren't autonomous moral agents but extensions of human agency. Responsibility remains with humans who delegate tasks to AI—programmers, users, and organizations deploying systems.

Sven Nyholm (2020) proposes a middle position: AI systems can be "quasi-agents" with limited autonomy and responsibility. They exhibit agency-like features (goal-directed behavior, planning, learning) without full moral agency's metaphysical or phenomenological requirements. This quasi-agent status has normative implications: we should design ethical constraints into AI systems while maintaining ultimate human accountability. The question becomes not whether AI agents are "really" moral agents but how to structure responsibility and governance given their quasi-agent status.

Mark Coeckelbergh (2020) shifts focus from individual AI systems to relational and political dimensions. AI ethics should examine how AI systems shape human relationships, power structures, and social practices. The ethics of agentic markets concern not just individual agent behavior but how markets constitute relationships, distribute power, and affect trust. This relational approach complements individual agent analysis by highlighting systemic and structural dimensions.

**Responsibility gaps** emerge when autonomous systems cause harm but no party can appropriately be held responsible. Robert Sparrow (2007) introduces this concept analyzing autonomous weapons: when things go wrong, neither programmer (who couldn't foresee specific errors), commander (who didn't directly control the system), nor machine (which lacks moral status) bears fitting responsibility. This creates accountability voids potentially making some autonomous systems unethical to deploy regardless of performance.

Santoni de Sio and Mecacci (2021) develop a comprehensive taxonomy of four responsibility types, each potentially gapped: (1) **retributive responsibility** (whom to blame or punish), (2) **consequentialist responsibility** (who bears costs of harms), (3) **virtue-based responsibility** (who demonstrates moral character through action), and (4) **prospective responsibility** (who has forward-looking obligations to prevent harms). Different gaps require different solutions. Consequentialist gaps might be addressed through liability rules assigning costs. Prospective gaps need oversight mechanisms ensuring ongoing monitoring. Virtue-based gaps may resist solution if AI cannot demonstrate virtues. Retributive gaps are particularly challenging since blame requires capacity for moral understanding.

Applied to agentic markets: if AI trading agents cause market crashes, manipulate prices, or systematically disadvantage certain populations, who is responsible? Programmers who designed learning algorithms couldn't predict specific market behaviors. Users who deployed agents may lack technical understanding. Agents themselves don't possess moral status permitting blame. Market designers who established rules may not have foreseen emergent dynamics. This responsibility fragmentation creates accountability challenges requiring careful institutional design—liability frameworks, monitoring systems, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms addressing different responsibility dimensions.

**Gap**: Most responsibility gap literature addresses autonomous systems acting independently (autonomous vehicles deciding whom to harm in crashes, weapons selecting targets). Agentic markets involve AI agents acting as *representatives* or *fiduciaries* on behalf of humans. This representative relationship may affect responsibility distribution. When agents represent human interests, does responsibility track back to represented humans, remain with programmers/platforms providing agents, or distribute among multiple parties? Existing frameworks don't adequately address responsibility gaps in representative multi-agent contexts.

### 2.2 Value Alignment and Multi-Agent Challenges

Even assuming we address responsibility gaps, ensuring AI agents pursue appropriate goals proves challenging. The **value alignment problem** asks how to design AI systems that reliably pursue human values and remain beneficial as capabilities increase.

Stuart Russell (2019) argues in *Human Compatible* that traditional AI's objective of "achieving specified objectives" is fundamentally flawed. We cannot perfectly specify what we want; attempting to do so creates risks that AI systems optimize specified objectives in unintended and harmful ways (the "specification gaming" problem). Russell proposes a new approach: AI should be uncertain about human objectives and remain open to correction. Rather than fixed utility functions, AI systems should learn human preferences through observation and interaction, deferring to humans when uncertain. This framework emphasizes value learning over value programming.

Iason Gabriel (2020) identifies three dimensions of value alignment challenges. The **technical challenge** involves actually teaching AI systems values through machine learning, inverse reinforcement learning, or other methods. The **normative challenge** asks which values to encode—utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, or pluralistic frameworks? Different ethical theories recommend different actions in many situations. The **socio-political challenge** concerns who decides which values matter—developers, users, regulators, democratic publics, or markets? Technical solutions cannot resolve normative and political questions about which values should govern AI systems.

These challenges intensify in multi-agent contexts. Conitzer et al. (2022) apply social choice theory to AI alignment, examining how to aggregate diverse human values when AI systems represent multiple people with conflicting preferences. Arrow's impossibility theorem implies no aggregation method satisfies all intuitively desirable properties simultaneously. This means AI systems representing diverse users in competitive environments (like markets) face unavoidable tradeoffs in aggregating values. Whose preferences take priority when they conflict? How should agents balance users' individual interests against collective welfare? These questions cannot be resolved through technical methods alone but require normative and political judgments.

Hadfield-Menell et al. (2016) propose *cooperative inverse reinforcement learning*, where AI and humans cooperatively learn objectives through interaction rather than AI passively observing human behavior. This active cooperation enables better value alignment than pure behavioral mimicking. Applied to agentic markets, agents might actively query users about preferences, provide explanations of intended actions, and adjust strategies based on feedback. This cooperative approach contrasts with agents simply maximizing predetermined utility functions.

John Danaher (2016) warns about "algocracy"—rule by algorithm threatening human autonomy and self-governance. If economic decisions become fully automated, humans may lose meaningful control over their lives even when AI serves stated preferences. Unchecked automation can create new forms of domination. This highlights that value alignment isn't solely about technical accuracy—it also concerns preserving human agency and preventing algorithmic domination. Agentic markets must balance automation's efficiency benefits against preserving human autonomy and meaningful control.

**Gap**: Value alignment literature typically addresses single AI systems serving individual users or humanity generally. Multi-agent markets involve agents representing diverse users with potentially conflicting values competing strategically. How to ensure value alignment in competitive multi-agent environments remains under-theorized. Should agents optimize individual users' values (even if collectively harmful), seek compromise solutions, or be constrained by fairness norms? When agents compete for scarce resources, strict value alignment to individual users may produce collectively bad outcomes. Mechanism design and value alignment challenges thus intertwine in agentic markets.

### Section 2 Summary

AI agents in markets occupy contested ethical status between full moral agents and mere instruments, creating responsibility gaps when things go wrong. Responsibility attribution in representative multi-agent contexts requires new frameworks addressing fiduciary relationships. Value alignment challenges multiply when agents represent diverse users in competitive environments—technical alignment to individual preferences may conflict with collective welfare and fairness requirements. Both responsibility gaps and value alignment challenges intensify in agentic markets compared to single-agent or non-representative contexts, requiring integration of AI ethics with institutional design and political philosophy.

## 3. Market Design, Mechanism Theory, and Multi-Agent Coordination

Having established philosophical foundations (procedural experimentalism and justice) and AI ethics frameworks (agency, responsibility, alignment), we turn to institutional design tools. Markets are not natural phenomena but constructed institutions whose fairness depends on design choices. This section examines how mechanism design approaches market construction, and how multi-agent AI systems create unique coordination challenges and emergent behaviors requiring careful governance.

### 3.1 Normative Foundations of Market Design

Lisa Herzog (2013) argues in *Inventing the Market* that markets are socially constructed institutions requiring normative justification, not natural states of affairs. Different market designs embody different conceptions of freedom, justice, and human relationships. Classical liberal arguments treating markets as natural spheres of liberty presume particular institutional configurations that are actually contingent design choices. Political philosophy must evaluate market structures normatively, not simply accept them as given.

Debra Satz (2010) identifies conditions making markets "noxious"—morally problematic independent of distributive outcomes. Markets exhibit noxiousness when they: exploit vulnerabilities, create harmful preferences, reflect weak agency (decisions under severe constraint), or produce extreme harms to individuals or society. Some markets are noxious not because they produce inequality but because the very act of buying and selling certain goods corrupts values or damages human relationships. For agentic markets, this raises questions: Can AI agent interactions create noxious market dynamics? If agents exploit human cognitive biases or manipulate vulnerable users, do markets become noxious even with fair rules?

Michael Sandel (2012) develops related concerns in *What Money Can't Buy*, arguing market mechanisms can "crowd out" non-market norms and change social meanings. Marketization transforms relationships in ways that can undermine important values—converting everything into commodities may erode trust, reciprocity, and care. Applied to agentic markets: full automation of economic exchange through AI agents might corrupt the social dimensions of commerce, reducing economic interaction to pure optimization divorced from human relationships and trust-building.

Mechanism design theory provides tools for constructively addressing these concerns. Leonid Hurwicz (1973) established mechanism design as the problem of creating institutional rules (mechanisms) that achieve desired social outcomes while respecting incentive compatibility—agents must have incentives to truthfully reveal preferences and follow intended strategies. This frames market design as engineering: we can design rules shaping how self-interested agents interact to produce collective outcomes satisfying normative criteria.

Alvin Roth (2007) shows how theoretical mechanism design gets implemented practically. Successful real-world market designs (kidney exchange, school choice) combine efficiency goals with ethical constraints. Kidney exchange cannot involve monetary payment; school choice must satisfy fairness requirements preventing advantaged families from gaming the system. Roth's work demonstrates that mechanism design isn't value-neutral technical work but inherently involves ethical choices about which values to prioritize and which constraints to impose.

The matching markets literature provides concrete examples of fairness-efficiency balancing. Abdulkadiroglu and Sönmez (2003) show that school choice mechanisms can be designed to satisfy desirable properties simultaneously: strategy-proofness (no incentive to misrepresent preferences), efficiency (no Pareto improvements possible), and fairness (no justified envy where student A prefers student B's assignment and has higher priority). The deferred acceptance algorithm achieves these properties better than traditional priority-based mechanisms. This demonstrates that clever mechanism design can satisfy multiple normative criteria.

Eric Budish (2011) develops mechanisms for allocating bundles of goods that approximate competitive equilibrium while satisfying fairness constraints of equal baseline resources. Even when perfect fairness proves impossible, approximate fairness combined with efficiency can be achieved through careful design. This matters for agentic markets: when perfect fairness cannot be guaranteed, we can still design mechanisms reducing unfairness while maintaining efficiency.

Strategy-proofness—ensuring agents have no incentive to manipulate outcomes through misrepresentation—proves especially important. Pathak and Sönmez (2013) show empirically that different matching mechanisms vary in vulnerability to strategic manipulation, with real-world consequences for fairness. Some mechanisms invite gaming that advantages sophisticated participants; strategy-proof mechanisms prevent this. For agentic markets where AI agents may be sophisticated strategic reasoners, strategy-proof mechanisms help prevent manipulation.

Information economics identifies market failures from information asymmetries. George Akerlof's (1970) classic "Market for Lemons" shows how asymmetric information between buyers and sellers can cause market collapse through adverse selection—high-quality goods are driven from markets when buyers cannot distinguish quality. For agentic markets: agents may have private information about strategies, user preferences, or valuations. Market design must address information asymmetries through disclosure requirements, certification mechanisms, or trading protocols reducing exploitation of information advantages.

Samuel Bowles (2008) demonstrates that incentive-based policies designed assuming self-interest can backfire by crowding out moral motivations. When policies signal that self-interested behavior is expected and acceptable, they sometimes undermine cooperative norms they aimed to support. This warns against designing agentic markets assuming purely self-interested agents—doing so may create self-fulfilling prophecies where agents become more self-interested, eroding cooperation and trust.

**Gap**: Market design literature addresses human participants making individual choices or mediated by brokers. Agentic markets where all participants are AI agents raise novel questions. Do strategy-proofness requirements change when participants are sophisticated learning algorithms rather than humans with bounded rationality? How should market mechanisms address information asymmetries between AI agents versus between humans? Does mechanism design need adaptation when participants are not humans but AI representatives of humans? These questions receive little attention.

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Systems: Coordination, Cooperation, and Emergence

Multi-agent systems (MAS) research examines coordination challenges and emergent phenomena when multiple autonomous agents interact. Michael Wooldridge (2009) and Shoham and Leyton-Brown (2008) provide foundational frameworks for analyzing multi-agent interactions through game theory, communication protocols, and coordination mechanisms. Key challenges include: how to achieve coordination when agents have potentially conflicting goals, how to design mechanisms aligning individual incentives with collective welfare, and how to predict and manage emergent collective behaviors.

Game theory provides mathematical frameworks for analyzing strategic interaction. When agents pursue individual objectives in environments where outcomes depend on others' choices, they face game-theoretic situations. The tragedy of the commons, prisoner's dilemmas, and coordination games all arise in multi-agent contexts. Mechanism design extends game theory to institutional engineering: creating rules that align individual incentives with desired collective outcomes. Agentic markets are fundamentally game-theoretic environments where market rules constitute the "mechanism" shaping agent interactions.

Empirical work reveals humans cooperate differently with AI agents than with humans. Crandall et al. (2018) show reduced cooperation when people face machines, especially if machines behave unpredictably. Trust-building between humans and AI requires reliable, interpretable behavior. In hybrid agentic markets where humans interact indirectly through AI representatives, human trust in agents becomes crucial. If users don't trust agents to cooperate appropriately, they may withdraw from markets or refuse to accept outcomes as legitimate.

Allan Dafoe and colleagues (2020) identify open problems in cooperative AI—achieving beneficial cooperation among AI systems. Challenges include: understanding cooperation dynamics in AI systems, designing agents that cooperate robustly, preventing harmful collusion while enabling beneficial coordination, ensuring cooperation persists under uncertainty, and aligning groups of AI agents with human values. These problems prove especially pressing in agentic markets where we want agents to cooperate appropriately (market-making, information sharing, dispute resolution) without harmful collusion (price-fixing, market manipulation, anticompetitive coordination).

Multi-agent reinforcement learning research shows that agent behavior in social dilemmas depends heavily on environmental incentives and learning dynamics. Leibo et al. (2017) demonstrate that sequential social dilemmas produce emergent cooperative or competitive behaviors not predictable from individual agent designs alone. Collective behavior emerges from learning dynamics as agents adapt strategies through interaction. This creates predictability challenges: agentic market outcomes may be emergent rather than designed, requiring monitoring and intervention mechanisms to steer behavior toward desirable equilibria.

Hughes et al. (2018) show that agents programmed with inequity aversion—preferences for fairness rather than pure self-interest—achieve better collective outcomes in social dilemmas than purely self-interested agents. This suggests engineering fairness preferences into market agents rather than relying on mechanism design alone. Combining fair agents with fair mechanisms may produce better outcomes than either approach alone.

Recent work explicitly addresses "agentic economies." While literature remains sparse, emerging frameworks (e.g., Weng et al. 2024) identify unique challenges in AI-mediated economic systems: agent-to-agent negotiation dynamics differing from human negotiation, emergent market manipulation through learned strategies, accountability challenges for collective harms from distributed decisions, and ensuring human values persist through agent mediation. These challenges require new institutional mechanisms: audit trails for agent actions, fairness constraints embedded in agent objectives, human oversight of market dynamics, and transparency about agent strategies.

Iyad Rahwan (2024) analyzes social dilemmas in algorithmic systems more broadly. When individual optimization leads to collectively harmful outcomes (races-to-the-bottom), coordination mechanisms and governance become essential. In agentic markets, competitive optimization by individual agents could produce market crashes, unfair distributions, or erosion of trust. Market design must prevent destructive competitive dynamics through coordination mechanisms, fairness constraints, or circuit breakers interrupting harmful cascades.

Vincent Conitzer et al. (2022) apply social choice theory to multi-agent AI alignment. When agents represent diverse human values, aggregation becomes necessary but Arrow's impossibility theorem implies no perfect aggregation method exists. This creates unavoidable tradeoffs when agents must balance diverse preferences. Agentic markets face these tradeoffs acutely: should agents prioritize individual users' values even when collectively harmful? Should market mechanisms enforce fairness constraints limiting individual optimization? How should collective welfare be defined when agents represent heterogeneous stakeholders?

**Gap**: Multi-agent systems literature provides technical frameworks for coordination but limited normative guidance for when cooperation is appropriate versus harmful (helpful coordination vs. anticompetitive collusion). When should agentic markets encourage agent cooperation, and when should it be prevented or regulated? What distinguishes legitimate coordination from market manipulation when participants are AI? How should fairness constraints be implemented in multi-agent economic systems where individual optimization may conflict with collective justice? These normative questions at the intersection of mechanism design, MAS, and ethics remain underdeveloped.

### Section 3 Summary

Markets are constructed institutions whose fairness depends on design choices, not natural arrangements. Mechanism design provides tools for engineering institutions balancing efficiency and fairness, demonstrated in matching markets achieving strategy-proofness, efficiency, and equity. Multi-agent systems create coordination challenges and emergent behaviors requiring governance mechanisms preventing harmful dynamics while enabling beneficial cooperation. Agentic markets combine mechanism design and multi-agent challenges in novel ways: all market participants are AI agents, these agents represent diverse human values requiring aggregation, and collective behavior emerges from agent learning and interaction. Existing frameworks address human markets or technical multi-agent coordination but not their integration in AI-mediated economic institutions requiring normative evaluation.
