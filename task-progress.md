## Completed Tasks

[2025-11-13] Phase 1 Complete: lit-review-plan.md (6 domains identified)
  - Domain 1: Housing Affordability and Cost Burden Economics (12-18 papers expected)
  - Domain 2: Labor Market Determinants and Wage Dynamics (10-15 papers expected)
  - Domain 3: Dualization Theory and Housing-Labor Market Interactions (8-12 papers expected)
  - Domain 4: Urban Housing Markets and Spatial Dimensions (10-14 papers expected)
  - Domain 5: Measurement and Operationalization of Housing Burden (6-10 papers expected)
  - Domain 6: Housing Policy and Institutional Context (8-12 papers expected)
  - Total expected: 54-81 papers

## Current Task

Phase 1 Complete - Waiting for user approval to proceed to Phase 2

## Next Steps

1. Get user approval of literature review plan
2. Proceed to Phase 2: Parallel literature search across 6 domains
3. Execute citation validation (Phase 3)
4. Create synthesis plan (Phase 4)
5. Write focused literature review (Phase 5)

## Notes

- User specified 6 specific hypotheses to investigate
- Studies must have housing costs/burden as outcome variable
- Need to extract: geography, time period, control variables, quantified findings
- Emphasis on quantitative empirical evidence
- Execution mode: Human-in-the-Loop (wait for approval between phases)
- Geographic focus: Germany (primary), Europe (secondary)
- Target output: 3000-4000 words, 15-25 papers cited
