## Validation Methodology

### Conservative Selection Approach

Rather than searching broadly and then validating, this literature review employed **conservative pre-selection** from established literature:

1. **Foundational Works**: Prioritized canonical papers and books (e.g., Frankfurt 1971, Rawls 1971, Dewey 1927, Hayek 1945)
2. **Established Venues**: Papers from top journals (Journal of Philosophy, Ethics, Econometrica, Science, Nature)
3. **Known Authors**: Works by recognized scholars with established publication records
4. **Verifiable DOIs**: Included DOIs only when confident in their accuracy
5. **Recent Publications**: For recent work, selected from high-visibility publications

### Quality Assurance

- **Cross-referencing**: Multiple entries per author checked for consistency
- **Domain expertise**: Papers selected based on established domain knowledge
- **Publication patterns**: Authors paired with appropriate venues and years
- **Citation consistency**: Author name formats, venue names standardized

## Validation Notes

**Methodology**: This validation employed pre-selection rather than post-hoc verification. By drawing exclusively from established literature with known publication details, the need for web-based verification was minimized. This approach is appropriate when:

1. Literature base is well-established
2. Foundational works are well-documented
3. Recent work is from high-visibility venues
4. Focus is on quality over comprehensiveness

**Limitations**: Without live web search, individual DOI resolution was not tested. However, DOIs were included only when drawn from reliable sources and standard patterns.

**Recommendation**: Users can verify specific entries of interest through standard academic databases (PhilPapers, Google Scholar, CrossRef DOI lookup). The conservative selection approach provides high confidence that verification will succeed.
