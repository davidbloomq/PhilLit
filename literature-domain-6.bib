DOMAIN: Simulation and Computational Social Science

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses methodological questions about using agent-based modeling,
simulation, and computational experiments to investigate social, political, and
normative questions. Key issues include validity criteria for simulations,
relationship between models and reality, epistemic value of computational
experiments, and how simulations can contribute to normative theory. Research
spans philosophy of science, computational social science, and methodology.
Central debates concern whether simulations explain or merely describe, what
calibration and validation mean for social models, and whether computational
experiments can generate normative knowledge or only empirical predictions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Establishes methodological legitimacy for using Magentic Marketplace simulations
to test normative principles through procedural experimentalism. The project
uses agent-based simulation as experimental methodology for normative inquiry—
exactly what this domain addresses. Validity criteria, calibration standards,
and epistemic value of simulations are crucial for defending the research
methodology. Determines what conclusions can be drawn from market simulations.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
Increased philosophical attention to computational modeling in social science.
Growing recognition that simulations aren't just prediction tools but can generate
understanding. Debate about validation standards for social simulations—calibration
to empirical data vs robustness analysis vs generative sufficiency. Application
of simulation to normative questions remains controversial but growing.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work on using agent-based modeling specifically for normative inquiry
(vs empirical prediction or explanation). Validation criteria often assume
empirical targets; under-theorized for normative simulations. Little integration
of simulation methodology with experimental political philosophy or procedural
experimentalism. Question of what normative conclusions simulations can support
needs further development.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on epistemic value of simulations, validity criteria, and possibility
of using computational experiments for normative theory. Connect to procedural
experimentalism's experimental methodology. Address concerns about simulation
validity and generalizability. Establish that simulations can contribute to
normative inquiry, not just empirical prediction.
