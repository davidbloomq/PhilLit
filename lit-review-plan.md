# Literature Review Plan: Housing Cost Burdens

**Research Question**: What explains what proportion of income people spend on housing?

**Geographic Focus**: Germany (primary), Europe (secondary)

**Disciplines**: Economics and Political Science

**Target Output**: 3000-4000 word focused literature review

## Research Hypotheses to Investigate

1. Even in cities with quickly rising housing costs, housing cost burdens are flat for median incomes
2. High housing burdens are an issue for city dwellers with low incomes
3. High housing burdens are an issue for public servants, or at least people where the government controls wages / The rise of housing-burden among lower-income recipients is due to wage repression in the public sector (unions and collective bargaining agreements)
4. More than 80% of the change in housing-burden is explicable by changes in wage income
5. Housing burden is determined by dualized housing and labor markets
6. The answer depends on how labor income and housing costs are operationalized, and how to do this is normatively charged (e.g., subjective vs. objective housing cost burden, or difference between the two)

## Data Extraction Requirements

For each study identified, extract:
1. **Geography**: Specific countries/cities covered
2. **Time period**: Years analyzed
3. **Data source**: Which dataset used (SOEP, EU-SILC, administrative data, etc.)
4. **Dependent variable**: How housing cost burden is measured/operationalized

   - Public vs. private sector differences
   - Urban vs. rural differences
   - Low-income vs. median-income burden patterns
   - Labor market status effects
   - Policy effects
7. **Relevance to hypotheses**: Which of the 6 hypotheses does this study inform?

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope:
- Housing cost burden as outcome variable
- Rent burden and homeownership costs
- Germany and European countries
- Economic and political science perspectives
- Quantitative empirical studies
- Both micro (household) and macro (regional/national) level studies

### Out of Scope:
- Studies where housing is only a control variable (not the outcome)
- Non-European contexts (unless highly relevant comparative studies)
- Purely theoretical papers without empirical analysis
- Studies focusing only on homelessness or extreme housing deprivation
- Real estate investment perspectives (unless relevant to burden distribution)

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary analysis suggests potential gaps:
1. **Public sector wage effects**: Limited research on how public sector wage dynamics specifically affect housing burden
2. **Dualization mechanisms**: Few studies explicitly test dualization theory as explanation for housing burden patterns
3. **Measurement normativity**: Limited critical analysis of normative assumptions in burden operationalization
4. **Wage-burden relationship**: Few studies quantify exactly how much of housing burden variation is explained by wage changes
5. **Urban median-income stability**: Limited evidence on whether median-income households maintain stable burdens in high-cost cities

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 6
- **Estimated papers**: 54-81 papers total across all domains
- **Final synthesis citations**: 15-25 papers (selective from total)
- **Target review length**: 3000-4000 words
- **Emphasis**: Quantitative findings, methodological approaches, research gaps relative to hypotheses
