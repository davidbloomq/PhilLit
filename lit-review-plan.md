# Literature Review Plan: Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy

## Research Idea Summary

This project applies social experimentation methodology to agentic markets—markets where AI agents transact, negotiate, and allocate resources on behalf of humans. Drawing on Adams and Himmelreich's procedural experimentalism in political philosophy, the research investigates whether decision-making procedures involving experimentation can justify normative principles when decision-makers are non-human but represent human interests. The project will use Magentic Marketplace (an open-source platform for simulating two-sided agentic markets) to conduct controlled normative simulations.

## Key Research Questions

1. Can procedural standards of fairness or accountability be realized and evaluated within agentic markets?
2. What counts as procedural justification when decision-makers are non-human but represent human interests?
3. Do agentic markets exhibit moral pathologies analogous to those in human institutions (bias, manipulation, epistemic injustice), and can procedural reforms mitigate them?
4. Can social-experimental reasoning be extended to hybrid systems of human and AI agents, yielding new criteria for legitimate automation?

## Coverage Rationale

These six domains provide comprehensive coverage of the research space by addressing:

1. **Philosophical foundations** (Domain 1): Core framework of procedural experimentalism
2. **Technical substrate** (Domain 2): What agentic markets actually are and how they work
3. **Normative frameworks** (Domain 3): Established market design principles to extend
4. **AI-specific ethics** (Domain 4): Moral dimensions of AI decision-making systems
5. **Representational legitimacy** (Domain 5): When AI can legitimately represent human interests
6. **Methodological grounding** (Domain 6): Validity of simulation-based normative inquiry

The domains are strategically organized to move from philosophical foundations → technical realization → normative application → methodological validation.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary analysis suggests several gaps that the research could fill:

1. **Extension of procedural experimentalism**: Adams & Himmelreich focus on human institutions; no existing work extends their framework to AI-mediated or fully automated systems.

2. **Normative evaluation of agentic markets**: While technical literature describes agentic markets and AI ethics literature discusses fairness, there's likely limited integration—philosophical evaluation using established frameworks like procedural experimentalism.

3. **Moral pathologies in multi-agent systems**: General AI ethics discusses bias and manipulation, but specific application to agentic market contexts (where agents negotiate on behalf of humans) is probably under-explored.

4. **Methodological bridge**: Computational social science and normative philosophy rarely intersect explicitly. Using agent-based simulation to test procedural principles represents a methodological innovation.

5. **Hybrid system legitimacy**: Most work treats either human decision-making or AI decision-making; the specific case of AI agents representing human interests in markets creates unique legitimacy questions.

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 6
- **Estimated papers**: 70-90 papers total across all domains
- **Key positions/debates**:
  - Procedural vs outcome-based justification (Domain 1)
  - Fairness criteria in market design (Domain 3)
  - Accountability frameworks for AI systems (Domain 4)
  - Conditions for legitimate AI representation (Domain 5)
  - Validity of computational normative experiments (Domain 6)
- **Time frame**:
  - Domain 1: Focus on Adams & Himmelreich recent work (last 10 years) plus foundational experimental philosophy
  - Domains 2, 4, 5: Emphasize recent work (last 5-10 years) given rapid AI development
  - Domains 3, 6: Mix of foundational work and recent applications

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational framework**: Adams & Himmelreich's work on procedural experimentalism must be thoroughly covered (Domain 1)

2. **Recent AI developments**: Agentic markets and AI ethics are rapidly evolving; prioritize last 5 years (Domains 2, 4, 5)

3. **Normative integration**: Seek papers that bridge technical and normative concerns—not just technical descriptions of AI systems or purely abstract ethics

4. **Methodological validation**: Papers defending or critiquing simulation-based normative inquiry (Domain 6)

5. **Interdisciplinary connections**: Papers that explicitly connect philosophy, AI, economics, and political theory

## Notes for Researchers

- **Domain 1**: Adams & Himmelreich may have limited publication volume; expand to broader experimental political philosophy and social epistemology if needed
- **Domain 2**: Balance technical AI/multi-agent papers with more accessible conceptual discussions
- **Domain 4**: Huge literature on AI ethics; focus on procedural fairness, accountability, and governance (not just bias detection or general ML ethics)
- **Domain 5**: Look for work on AI fiduciary relationships, algorithmic agents as representatives/proxies
- **All domains**: Prioritize papers that address normative dimensions, not purely technical or descriptive work
- **Cross-domain synthesis**: Note papers that bridge multiple domains (e.g., AI ethics + market design, procedural experimentalism + simulation methodology)
