====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Market design and mechanism design study how to construct economic institutions
with desirable properties. Mechanism design is the reverse of game theory—rather
than analyzing equilibria of given games, it designs games (mechanisms) that
incentivize desired outcomes. Key concerns include efficiency, fairness, incentive
compatibility, and stability. Important applications include matching markets
(kidney exchange, school choice), spectrum auctions, and financial market regulation.
Recent work addresses information design, transparency requirements, and fairness
constraints. The field combines economics, computer science, and operations research.
Normative questions about what makes mechanisms legitimate or fair are central.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Establishes normative frameworks for evaluating markets that can be extended to
agentic contexts. Procedural features (transparency, information access, fairness
constraints) that market designers manipulate are precisely the procedural variables
that experimental evaluation might test. Market design literature provides vocabulary
for discussing procedural properties and connects economic efficiency to normative
concepts like fairness and equal treatment. Central for understanding what procedural
standards might apply to agentic markets.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
Increased emphasis on fairness constraints alongside efficiency (constrained
mechanism design). Growing attention to information design and transparency.
Application to online platforms and digital markets. Integration of behavioral
economics insights into mechanism design. Debate about trade-offs between
different fairness criteria.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work on how mechanism design principles apply when participants are AI
agents rather than humans. Questions about whether standard fairness criteria
(e.g., envy-freeness) make sense for agents representing humans. How transparency
requirements change when agents have different information processing capabilities
than humans. Procedural justification of mechanisms under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on papers addressing normative dimensions of mechanism design (fairness,
legitimacy, transparency) rather than pure efficiency. Emphasize tension between
different normative criteria and how mechanism design handles trade-offs. Connect
to procedural experimentalism's emphasis on learning what principles require.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical mechanism design: 3 papers - Efficiency and incentive compatibility
- Fair division and matching: 4 papers - Fairness in allocation and matching
- Information design: 2 papers - Transparency and information structures
- Constrained mechanism design: 2 papers - Multiple normative criteria
- Market regulation: 2 papers - Oversight and intervention

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that economics increasingly involves designing institutions rather than just analyzing them. Market design requires combination of theory, experimentation, and computation. Experimentation is essential because theory alone cannot predict all institutional features that matter. Successful market designs emerge from iterative testing and refinement. RELEVANCE: Directly supports experimental approach to evaluating market mechanisms. Roth's emphasis on experimentation aligns with procedural experimentalism. Shows that market design community already recognizes need for experimental validation, though typically focused on efficiency rather than normative principles.
